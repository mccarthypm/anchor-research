ITEM 1A. RISK FACTORS

Our operations and financial results are subject to various risks and uncertainties, including those described below, that could adversely affect
our business, financial condition, results of operations, cash flows, and the trading price of our common stock.

We face intense competition across
all markets for our products and services, which may lead to lower revenue or operating margins.

Competition in the technology sector

Our competitors range in size from diversified global companies with significant research and development resources to small,
specialized firms whose narrower product lines may let them be more effective in deploying technical, marketing, and financial resources. Barriers to entry in our businesses generally are low and software products can be distributed broadly and
quickly at relatively low cost. Many of the areas in which we compete evolve rapidly with changing and disruptive technologies, shifting user needs, and frequent introductions of new products and services. Our ability to remain competitive depends
on our success in making innovative products, devices, and services that appeal to businesses and consumers.

Competition among platforms,
ecosystems, and devices

An important element of our business model has been to create platform-based ecosystems on which many
participants can build diverse solutions. A well-established ecosystem creates beneficial network effects among users, application developers, and the platform provider that can accelerate growth. Establishing significant scale in the marketplace is
necessary to achieve and maintain attractive margins. The strategic importance of developing and maintaining a vibrant ecosystem increased with the launch of the Windows 8 operating system, Surface, Windows Phone, and associated cloud-based
services. We face significant competition from firms that provide competing platforms, applications, and services.

  A competing vertically-integrated model, in which a single firm controls the software and hardware elements of a product and related services, has been                                               

  We derive substantial revenue from licenses of Windows operating systems on personal computers. We face substantial competitive challenges from competing

  Competing platforms have applications marketplaces (sometimes referred to as “stores”) with scale and significant installed bases on mobile devices.                                                  
  These applications leverage free and user-paid services that over time result in disincentives for users to switch to competing platforms. In order to compete, we must successfully enlist devel...
