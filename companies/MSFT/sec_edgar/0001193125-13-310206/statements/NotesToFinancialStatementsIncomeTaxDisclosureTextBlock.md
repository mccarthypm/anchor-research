The items accounting for
the difference between income taxes computed at the U. S. federal
statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:

  Year Ended June 30,

  Other reconciling items,                1.7%         0.2%       (0.2)%  
  Effective rate                         19.2%        23.8%        17.5%  

The reduction from the
federal statutory rate from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates
results from producing and distributing our products and services
through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland,
Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign earnings, which are taxed
at rates lower than the U. S. rate and are generated from our
regional operating centers, were 79%, 79%, and 78% of our
international income before tax in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and
2011, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist of
interest, U. S. state income taxes, domestic production deductions,
and credits. In fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, there were no
individually significant other reconciling items. The I. R. S.
settlement is discussed below.

The components of the
deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as
follows:

As of June 30, 2013,
we had net operating loss carryforwards of $2.7 billion, including
$2.2 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards acquired
through our acquisition of Skype. The valuation allowance disclosed
in the table above relates to the foreign net operating loss
carryforwards that may not be realized.

Deferred income tax
balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the
taxes are actually paid or recovered.

As of June 30, 2013,
we have not provided deferred U. S. income taxes or foreign
withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $76.4
billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U. S. subsidiaries
which are permanently reinvested outside the U. S. The unrecognized
deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences
was approximately $24.4 billion at June 30, 2013.

Income taxes paid were
$3.9 billion, $3.5 billion, and $5.3 billion in fiscal years 2013,
2012, and 2011, respectively.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

As of June 30, 2013,
we had $8.6 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $6.5
billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of
June 30, 2012, we had $7.2 billion of unrecognized tax
benefits of which $6.2 billion, if recognized, would have affected
our effective tax rate.

Interest on unrecognized
tax benefits was $400 million, $154 million, and $38 million in
fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011, respectively. As of
June 30, 2013, 2012, and 2011, we had accrued interest related
to uncertain tax positions of $1.3 billion, $939 million, and $785
million, respectively, net of federal income tax
benefits.

The aggregate changes in
the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as
follows:

During the third quarter
of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an
I. R. S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income
tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the
I. R. S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February
2012, the I. R. S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and
reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30,
2013, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing,
which could have a significant impact on our financial statements
if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for tax
contingencies are appropriate. We do not believe it is reasonably
possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months,
because we do not believe the remaining open issues will be
resolved within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject
to examination by the I. R. S. for tax years 2007 to 2012.

We are subject to income
tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our operations in
certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years
1996 to 2012, some of which are currently under audit by local tax
authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be
material to our financial statements.
