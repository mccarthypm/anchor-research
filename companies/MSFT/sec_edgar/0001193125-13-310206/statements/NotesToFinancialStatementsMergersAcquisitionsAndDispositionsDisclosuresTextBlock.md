BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

Yammer

On July 18, 2012, we
acquired Yammer, Inc. (“ Yammer”), a leading provider of
enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. Yammer will
continue to develop its standalone service and will add an
enterprise social networking service to Microsoft’s portfolio
of complementary cloud-based services. The major classes of assets
to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $937
million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. We
assigned the goodwill to the Microsoft Business Division. Yammer
was consolidated into our results of operations starting on the
acquisition date.

Skype

On October 13, 2011,
we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of Skype
Global S.á r. l. (“ Skype”), a leading global
provider of software applications and related Internet
communications products based in Luxembourg, for $8.6 billion,
primarily in cash. The major classes of assets and liabilities to
which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $7.1
billion, identifiable intangible assets of $1.6 billion, and
unearned revenue of $222 million. The goodwill recognized in
connection with the acquisition is primarily attributable to our
expectation of extending Skype’s brand and the reach of its
networked platform, while enhancing Microsoft’s existing
portfolio of real-time communications products and services. We
assigned the goodwill to the following segments: $4.2 billion to
Entertainment and Devices Division, $2.8 billion to Microsoft
Business Division, and $54 million to Online Services Division.
Skype was consolidated into our results of operations starting on
the acquisition date.

Following are the details
