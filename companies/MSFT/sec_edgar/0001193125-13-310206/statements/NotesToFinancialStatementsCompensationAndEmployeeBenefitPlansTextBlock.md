EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS

We grant stock-based
compensation to directors and employees. At June 30, 2013, an
aggregate of 425 million shares were authorized for future
grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards,
and leadership stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled
without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance
under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to
satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our
stock plans.

Stock-based compensation
expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:

Stock awards

Stock awards
(“ SAs”) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of
Microsoft common stock as the award vests. SAs generally vest over
a five-year period.

Leadership stock
awards

Leadership stock awards
(“ LSAs”) are a form of SAs in which the number of
shares ultimately received depends on our business performance
against specified performance metrics. LSAs replaced shared
performance stock awards (“ SPSA”) in fiscal year 2013.
Shares previously issued under the SPSA program will continue to
vest ratably under their original term, generally with a three-year
remaining service period.

A base number of LSAs are
granted in each fiscal year, which represents the performance
period for the awards. Following the end of the performance period,
the number of shares can be increased by 25% if certain performance
metrics are met. One quarter of the awarded shares will vest one
year after the grant date. The remaining shares will vest
semi-annually during the following three years.

Executive incentive
plan

Under the Executive
Incentive Plan (“ EIP”), the Compensation Committee
awards performance-based compensation comprising both cash and SAs
to executive officers and certain senior executives. For executive
officers, their awards are based on an aggregate incentive pool
equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. For fiscal
years 2013, 2012, and 2011, the pool was 0.35%, 0.3%, and 0.25% of
operating income, respectively. The SAs vest ratably in August of
each of the four years following the grant date. The final cash
awards will be determined after each performance period based on
individual and business performance.

Activity for all stock
plans

The fair value of each
award was estimated on the date of grant using the following
assumptions:

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

We have an employee stock
purchase plan (the “ Plan”) for all eligible employees.
Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at
three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last
trading day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase
shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation
during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares
during the periods presented:

  (Shares in millions)

  Average price per share      26.81      25.03      22.98  

At June 30, 2013,
191 million shares of our common stock were reserved for
future issuance through the Plan.

Savings Plan

We have a savings plan in
the U. S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international
locations. Participating U. S. employees may contribute up to 75% of
their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute
fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan,
with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s
earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $393 million,
$373 million, and $282 million in fiscal years 2013, 2012, and
2011, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching
contributions are invested proportionate to each
participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment
options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U. S.
plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor
our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft
common stock.
