  Not          

As of June 30, 2013
and 2012, the aggregate unamortized discount for our long-term
debt, including the current portion, was $65 million and $56
million, respectively.

Notes

The Notes are senior
unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt outstanding.

Convertible Debt

In June 2013, we paid
cash of $1.25 billion for the principal amount of our zero coupon
convertible unsecured debt and elected to deliver cash for the $96
million excess obligation resulting from the conversion of the
notes. Each $1,000 principal amount of notes was convertible into
30.68 shares of Microsoft common stock at a conversion price of
$32.59 per share. As of June 30, 2012, the net carrying amount
of the convertible debt and the unamortized discount were $1.2
billion and $19 million, respectively.

In connection with the
issuance of the notes in 2010, we entered into capped call
transactions with certain option counterparties with a strike price
equal to the conversion price of the notes. Upon conversion of the
notes in June 2013, we exercised the capped calls. The bulk of the
capped calls were physically settled by acquiring 29 million
shares of our own common stock for $938 million. The remaining
capped calls were net cash settled for $24 million.

Debt Service

Maturities of our
long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are
as follows:

  Thereafter                 9,115  
  Total                     15,665  

Interest on the notes is
paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities
on which interest is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our
debt for fiscal years 2013, 2012, and 2011 was $371 million, $344
million, and $197 million, respectively.

Credit Facility

In June 2013, we
established a commercial paper program for the issuance and sale of
up to $1.3 billion in commercial paper. As of June 30, 2013,
we have not issued any commercial paper under this
program.

In June 2013, we entered
into a $1.3 billion credit facility, which will serve as a back-up
for our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2013, we were
in compliance with the only financial covenant in the credit
agreement, which requires us to maintain a coverage ratio of at
least three times earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation,
and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the credit
agreement. The credit facility expires on June 24, 2018. No
amounts were drawn against the credit facility since its
inception.
