DERIVATIVES

We use derivative
instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity
prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns;
and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for
holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently
managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as
possible.

Our derivative programs
include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are
measured in U. S. dollar equivalents.

Foreign Currency

Certain forecasted
transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign
currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to
maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge
positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion
of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the
future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, and Canadian dollar. As of June 30, 2013 and
June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign
exchange contracts sold were $5.1 billion and $6.7 billion,
respectively.

Foreign currency risks
related to certain non-U. S. dollar denominated securities are
hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated
as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2013 and
June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign
exchange contracts sold were $407 million and $1.3 billion,
respectively.

Certain options and
forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to
manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts receivable,
cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other foreign
currency exposures.  As of June 30, 2013, the total
notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and
sold were $5.0 billion and $7.9 billion, respectively. As of
June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts of these foreign
exchange contracts purchased and sold were $3.6 billion and $7.3
billion, respectively.

Equity

Securities held in our
equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price
risk.  Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based
global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible
preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not
designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our
price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging
instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.  As of
June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of designated and
non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $898
million and $1.0 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2012,
the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity
contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $982 million,
respectively.

Interest Rate

Securities held in our
fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks
based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate
to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded
option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As
of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest
rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $809
million, respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional
amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were
$3.2 billion and $1.9 billion, respectively.

In addition, we use
“ To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of
mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
securities.  These meet the definition of a derivative
instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not
taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30,
2013 and 2012, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage
contracts purchased were $1.2 billion and $1.1 billion,
respectively.

Credit

Our fixed-income
portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade
securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as
hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to
broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We
use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing
exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As
of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of credit
contracts purchased and sold were $377 million and $501 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts
of credit contracts purchased and sold were $318 million and $456
million, respectively.

Commodity

We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate
portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and
manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use
derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to
the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including,
but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of
June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of commodity
contracts purchased and sold were $1.2 billion and $249 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2012, the total notional amounts
of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.5 billion and
$445 million, respectively.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent
Features

Certain of our
counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term
unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and
require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the
extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to
post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2013, our
long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were
in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required
to be posted.

Fair Values of Derivative
Instruments

The following tables
present the gross fair values of derivative instruments designated
as hedging instruments (“designated hedge derivatives”)
and not designated as hedging instruments (“non-designated
hedge derivatives”). The fair values exclude the impact of
netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value
adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit
risk:

Cash Flow Hedge Gains

We recognized the

as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during the periods
presented):

We estimate that $95
million of net derivative gains included in AOCI at June 30,
2013 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12
months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified
from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that
failed to occur during fiscal year 2013.

Non-Designated Derivative Gains
(Losses)

Gains (losses) from
changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). These
amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains
(losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items
other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the
periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered into for
investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains
(losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized
gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale
securities.
