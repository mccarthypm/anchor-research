SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the
business, management, including our chief operating decision maker,
the company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss
statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U. S. GAAP. The
segment information within this note is reported on that basis.
During the periods presented, our five segments were Windows
Division, Server and Tools, Online Services Division, Microsoft
Business Division, and Entertainment and Devices Division. During
the three months ended December 31, 2012, we changed the name
of our Windows & Windows Live Division to Windows
Division.

Due to the integrated
structure of our business, certain revenue earned and costs
incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on
certain contracts may be allocated among the segments based on the
relative value of the underlying products and services. Costs that
are identifiable are allocated to the segments that benefit to
incent cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment
is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial
activity. Allocated costs may include those relating to development
and marketing of products and services from which multiple segments
benefit, or those costs relating to services performed by one
segment on behalf of other segments. Each allocation is measured
differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the
costs being allocated.

In addition, certain
costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that
benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs
include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared
facilities services; and customer service and support. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and
circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain other
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments,
including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product
support services; human resources; legal; finance; information
technology; corporate development and procurement activities;
research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and
employee severance.

We have recast certain
prior period amounts within this note to conform to the way we
internally managed and monitored segment performance during the
current fiscal year, reflecting immaterial movements of business
activities between segments and changes in cost allocations. In
July 2013, we announced a change in organizational structure as
part of our transformation to a devices and services company. As we
evolve how we allocate resources and analyze performance in the new
structure, it is possible that our segments may change.

The principal products
and services provided by each segment are summarized
below:

Windows Division

Server and Tools

Online Services Division

Microsoft Business
Division

Entertainment and
Devices Division

Segment revenue and operating income
(loss) were as follows during the periods presented:

Assets are not allocated
to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of
amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs
in an overhead allocation to each segment, and it is impracticable
for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and
depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment
profit or loss.
