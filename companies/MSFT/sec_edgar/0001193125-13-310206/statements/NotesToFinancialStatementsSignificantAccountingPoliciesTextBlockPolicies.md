| **      Accounting Principles** | Accounting
Principles

The financial statements
and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“ U. S. GAAP”).
 |
| **      Principles of Consolidation** | Principles of
Consolidation

The financial statements
include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity
investments through which we exercise significant influence over
but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary
of the investee’s activities are accounted for using the
equity method. Investments through which we are not able to
exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not
have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the
cost method.
 |
|       Estimates and Assumptions | Estimates and
Assumptions

Preparing financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies;
product warranties; the fair value of, and/or potential goodwill
impairment for, our reporting units; product life cycles; useful
lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for
doubtful accounts; allowances for product returns; the market value
of our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates.
Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software
arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or
enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is
achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial
statements or tax returns; and determining when investment
impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes
may differ from management’s estimates and
assumptions.
 |
| **      Foreign Currencies** | Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities
recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate
on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to other
comprehensive income (“ OCI”).
 |
| **      Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for
returns and any taxes collected from customers and subsequently
remitted to governmental authorities.

Revenue for retail
packaged products, products licensed to original equipment
manufacturers (“ OEMs”), and perpetual licenses under
certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as
products are shipped or made available.

Technology guarantee
programs are accounted for as multiple element arrangements as
customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use
upcoming new versions of a software product if they license
existing versions of the product during the eligibility period.
Revenue is allocated between the existing product and the new
product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until
that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the
vendor-specific objective evidence (“ VSOE”) of fair
value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new
products are based on the price determined by management having the
relevant authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but
is expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by
management.

Software updates that
will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a case-by-case
basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade
and create a multiple element arrangement, which may require
revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is
delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract
customer support (“ PCS”) is being provided, the
arrangement is accounted for as a multiple element arrangement and
all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over
the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If
updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,
revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made
available. Windows 8.1 will enable new hardware, further the
integration with other Microsoft services and fix some of the
customer issues with Windows 8, and will be provided to Windows 8
customers when available at no additional charge.  We evaluated
Windows 8.1 and determined that it did not meet the definition of
an upgrade and thus have not deferred revenue related to this
planned release.

Certain volume licensing
arrangements include a perpetual license for current products
combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of
software products (“ Software Assurance”), which we have
determined are additional software products and are therefore
accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned
revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.
Arrangements that include term based licenses for current products
with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software
during the coverage period, are also accounted for as
subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage
period.

Revenue from cloud-based
services arrangements that allow for the use of a hosted software
product or service over a contractually determined period of time
without taking possession of software are accounted for as
subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and
recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on
the date the service is made available to customers. Revenue from
cloud-based services arrangements that are provided on a
consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in a
particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer
utilization of such resources.

Some volume licensing
arrangements include time-based subscriptions for cloud-based
services and software offerings that are accounted for as
subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple element
arrangements. However, because all elements are accounted for as
subscriptions and have the same coverage period and delivery
pattern, they have the same revenue recognition timing.

Revenue related to
Surface, our Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for
Xbox 360, games published by us, and other hardware components is
generally recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers
or end customers when selling directly through Microsoft Stores.
Revenue related to games published by third parties for use on the
Xbox 360 platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the
game publishers.

Display advertising
revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search
advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search
results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been
completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services
are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the
consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the
period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is
recognized as services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points
redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized
upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or
services.
 |
| **      Cost of Revenue** | Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes:
manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs
licensed; operating costs related to product support service
centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include
software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and
to acquire online advertising space (“traffic acquisition
costs”); costs incurred to support and maintain
Internet-based products and services, including datacenter costs
and royalties; warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments;
costs associated with the delivery of consulting services; and the
amortization of capitalized research and development costs.
Capitalized research and development costs are amortized over the
estimated lives of the products.
 |
|       Product Warranty | Product Warranty

We provide for the
estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and
software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical
and projected product failure rates, historical and projected
repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any).
The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending
upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but
generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging
from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we
estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches,
over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate
our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty
liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
 |
| **      Research and Development** | Research and
Development

Research and development
expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with product development. Research and development
expenses also include third-party development and programming
costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for
international markets, and the amortization of purchased software
code and services content. Such costs related to software
development are included in research and development expense until
the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our
software products, is generally shortly before the products are
released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of
revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
 |
| **      Sales and Marketing** | Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing
expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of
advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was
$2.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion in fiscal years 2013,
2012, and 2011, respectively.
 |
|       Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-Based
Compensation

We measure stock-based
compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the
award and recognize it as expense, net of estimated forfeitures,
over the vesting or service period, as applicable, of the stock
award (generally four to five years) using the straight-line
method.
 |
| **      Employee Stock Purchase Plan** | Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

Shares of our common stock
may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90% of
the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each
three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock
purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled
to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of
purchase.
 |
| **      Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income tax expense
includes U. S. and international income taxes, the provision for
U. S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries
not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties
on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not
reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year.
The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as
deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported net of a
valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax
benefit will not be realized. The deferred income taxes are
classified as current or long-term based on the classification of
the related asset or liability.
 |
|       Fair Value Measurements | Fair Value
Measurements

We account for certain
assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists
three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used
in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  We
categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these
three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels
are:

  Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted                

  Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for                    

  Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and                      

We measure certain assets,
including our cost and equity method investments, at fair value on
a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these
investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the
best information available, and may include quoted market prices,
market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An
impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be
other-than-temporary.

Our other current
financial assets and our current financial liabilities have fair
values that approximate their carrying values.
 |
| **      Financial Instruments** | Financial
Instruments

We consider all highly
liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months
or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In
general, investments with original maturities of greater than three
months and remaining maturities of less than one year are
classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities
beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their
highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities
represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI.

Equity and other
investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity
instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments
that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly
traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.

We lend certain
fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our
balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as
collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined
based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of
the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a
corresponding liability.

Investments are considered
to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be
other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly
available market information or other estimates determined by
management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis
that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in
evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of
an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt
instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value
is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and
ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income
securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the
security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to
sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific
adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business
outlook for the investee, including industry and sector
performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing
cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be
other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other
income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is
established.

Derivative instruments are
recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at fair
value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a derivative
depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting
designation.

For derivative instruments
designated as fair-value hedges, the gains (losses) are recognized
in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting
losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being
hedged. For options designated as fair-value hedges, changes in the
time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness
and are recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments
designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion of the gains
(losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of
OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged
exposure is recognized in earnings. For options designated as
cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.
Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge components
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge
ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments
that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from changes in
fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense).
Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes,
such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally
economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying
available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a component of
OCI until the securities are sold or other-than-temporarily
impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income (“ AOCI”) into
other income (expense).

|       Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The allowance for doubtful
accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses inherent in
the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance based
on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other
currently available evidence. Activity in the allowance for
doubtful accounts was as follows:

  (In

 |
| **      Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are stated at
average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. Cost includes
materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the
purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review
inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our
suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our
review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we
reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost
of revenue.
 |
| **      Property and Equipment** | Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment is
stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease
term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are
generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for
internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years;
buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold
improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to
five years. Land is not depreciated.
 |
|       Goodwill | Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one
level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us)
and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value.
 |
|       Intangible Assets | Intangible Assets

All of our intangible
assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit,
ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of
intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or
circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or
that indicate the asset may be impaired.
 |
| **      Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance** | Recently adopted accounting
guidance

In September 2011, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) issued
guidance on testing goodwill for impairment. The new guidance
provides an entity the option to first perform a qualitative
assessment to determine whether it is more likely than not that the
fair value of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If
an entity determines that this is the case, it is required to
perform the two-step goodwill impairment test to identify potential
goodwill impairment and measure the amount of goodwill impairment
loss to be recognized for that reporting unit (if any). If an
entity determines that the fair value of a reporting unit is
greater than its carrying amount, the two-step goodwill impairment
test is not required. We adopted this new guidance beginning
July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2011, the FASB
issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.  The
new guidance eliminated the option to report OCI and its components
in the statement of changes in stockholders’
equity.  Instead, an entity is required to present either a
continuous statement of net income and OCI or in two separate but
consecutive statements.  We adopted this new guidance beginning
July 1, 2012. Adoption of this new guidance resulted only in
changes to presentation of our financial statements.
 |
|       Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted | Recent accounting guidance not yet
adopted

In December 2011, the FASB
issued guidance enhancing disclosure requirements about the nature
of an entity’s right to offset and related arrangements
associated with its financial instruments and derivative
instruments. The new guidance requires the disclosure of the gross
amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts offset in accordance
with the accounting standards followed, and the related net
exposure. In January 2013, the FASB clarified that the scope of
this guidance applies to derivatives, including bifurcated embedded
derivatives, repurchase agreements and reverse repurchase
agreements, and securities borrowing and securities lending
transactions that are either offset or subject to an enforceable
master netting arrangement, or similar agreements. The new guidance
will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2013. Other than
requiring additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material
impacts on our financial statements upon adoption.

In February 2013, the FASB
issued guidance on disclosure requirements for items reclassified
out of AOCI. This new guidance requires entities to present (either
on the face of the income statement or in the notes) the effects on
the line items of the income statement for amounts reclassified out
of AOCI. The new guidance will be effective for us beginning
July 1, 2013. Other than requiring additional disclosures, we
do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements upon
adoption.

In March 2013, the FASB
issued guidance on a parent’s accounting for the cumulative
translation adjustment upon derecognition of a subsidiary or group
of assets within a foreign entity. This new guidance requires that
the parent release any related cumulative translation adjustment
into net income only if the sale or transfer results in the
complete or substantially complete liquidation of the foreign
entity in which the subsidiary or group of assets had resided. The
new guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2014.
We do not anticipate material impacts on our financial statements
upon adoption.
 |
| **      Earnings Per Share Policy** | Basic earnings per share
(“ EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock
options, stock awards, and shared performance stock
awards.
 |
| **      Segment Reporting Policy** | Reconciling amounts in
the tables above and below include adjustments to conform our
internal accounting policies to U. S. GAAP and corporate-level
activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant
internal accounting policies that differ from U. S. GAAP relate to
revenue recognition, income statement classification, and
depreciation.
