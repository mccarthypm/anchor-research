Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act(“TCJA”) was enacted into law, 
which significantly changed existing U. S. tax law and included numerous 
provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional net charge of 
$13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018 and 
adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 
million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 118.

In fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we
transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to 
the U. S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6
billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability 
from foreign jurisdictions and U. S. global intangible low-taxed income 
(“GILTI”) tax.

We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through 
distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the 
India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre 
of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in
86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are 
not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the 
appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to 
withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 
million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the 
India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 
2016.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily 
due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from 
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign 
regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to
stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision
on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal 
year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign 
jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and 
services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto 
Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from 
the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 
billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property transfers, and 
earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing 
and distributing our products and services through our foreign regional 
operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year 2021 
and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, 
which are taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, generated 82% and 86% of our
foreign income before tax. In fiscal years 2019, our foreign regional operating 
centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower 
than the U. S. rate, generated 82% of our foreign income before tax, 
respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and
GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, includes tax benefits from the India Supreme
Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, there
were no individually significant other reconciling items.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal 
year 2020 was primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court 
decision on withholding taxes, an agreement between the U. S. and India tax 
authorities related to transfer pricing, final TCJA regulations, and an increase
in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The increase in our 
effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal year 2019 was 
primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the fourth quarter of 
fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers.

The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2021, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $304 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.0 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years 
from fiscal 2022 through 2041, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss 
carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be 
realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be 
realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating 
losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of 
a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial 
statements.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $13.4 billion, $12.5 billion, and $8.4 
billion in fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 
30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, were $14.6 billion, $13.8 billion, and $13.1 billion, 
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would 
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 by $12.5 
billion, $12.1 billion, and $12.0 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $4.3 billion, $4.0 billion, and $3.4 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for 
fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019 included interest expense related to uncertain
tax positions of $274 million, $579 million, and $515 million, respectively, net
of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years
2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 
Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of 
the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of 
the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second 
quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits 
for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and
interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.

As of June 30, 2021, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to 
transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated 
financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances 
for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed 
assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a 
final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to 
our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 
1996 to 2020, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. 
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our 
consolidated financial statements.
