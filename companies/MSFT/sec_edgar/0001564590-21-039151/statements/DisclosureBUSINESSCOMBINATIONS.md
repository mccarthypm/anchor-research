ZeniMax Media Inc.

On March 9, 2021, we completed our acquisition of ZeniMax Media Inc. 
(“ZeniMax”), the parent company of Bethesda Softworks LLC (“Bethesda”), for a 
total purchase price of $8.1 billion, consisting primarily of cash. The purchase
price included $768 million of cash and cash equivalents acquired. Bethesda is 
one of the largest, privately held game developers and publishers in the world, 
and brings a broad portfolio of games, technology, and talent to Xbox. The 
financial results of ZeniMax have been included in our consolidated financial 
statements since the date of the acquisition. ZeniMax is reported as part of our
More Personal Computing segment.

The purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a 
preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are 
completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed becomes available.

The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily 
allocated the purchase price were as follows:

  Total                          8,121  

Goodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment. The goodwill was 
primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved 
from the integration of ZeniMax. None of the goodwill is expected to be 
deductible for income tax purposes.
