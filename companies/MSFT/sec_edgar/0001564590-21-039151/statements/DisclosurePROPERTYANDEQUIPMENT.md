During fiscal years 2021, 2020, and 2019, depreciation expense was $9.3 billion,
$10.7 billion, and $9.7 billion, respectively. Depreciation expense declined in 
fiscal year 2021 due to the change in estimated useful lives of our server and 
network equipment. We have committed $9.5 billion for the construction of new 
buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements as of June 30, 
2021.

During fiscal year 2020, we recorded an impairment charge of $186 million to 
Property and Equipment, primarily to leasehold improvements, due to the closing 
of our Microsoft Store physical locations.
