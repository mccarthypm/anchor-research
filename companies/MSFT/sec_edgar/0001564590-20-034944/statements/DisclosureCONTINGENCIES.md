Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

There were 64 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30,
2020, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.

Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions

Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in 
British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on 
behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft 
operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 
and 2010.

The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. Following a 
mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three Canadian 
actions, and submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in all 
three jurisdictions for approval. The final settlement has been approved by the 
courts in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, and the claims administration 
process will commence once each court approves the form of notice to the class.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims

China State Administration for Industry and Commerce Investigation

In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation 
(“SAMR”) (formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a 
formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR 
conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, 
Guangzhou, and Chengdu. The SAMR has presented its preliminary views as to 
certain possible violations of China's Anti-Monopoly Law, and discussions are 
expected to continue.

Product-Related Litigation

U. S. Cell Phone Litigation

Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset 
manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 40 lawsuits filed in the 
Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege 
that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other 
adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our 
agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been 
substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and
are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are 
stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular
handsets that operate within the U. S. Federal Communications Commission radio 
frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. 
The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC 
Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The 
lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and 
testing around emission guidelines.

In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the 
plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed 
scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in
part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation 
experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of 
Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert 
scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision 
adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the
trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have 
filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the defendants have moved 
to strike. In August 2018, the trial court issued an order striking portions of 
the plaintiffs’ expert reports. A hearing isexpected to occur inthe second 
quarter of fiscal year 2021.

Other Contingencies

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time 
to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently 
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of 
these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2020, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $306 million. 
While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we 
estimate could reach approximately $500 million in aggregate beyond recorded 
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated 
financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably 
estimable.
