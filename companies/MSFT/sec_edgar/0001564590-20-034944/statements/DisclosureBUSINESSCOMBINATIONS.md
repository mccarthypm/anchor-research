GitHub, Inc.

On October 25, 2018, we acquired GitHub, Inc. (“GitHub”), a software development
platform, in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total cash payments 
of $1.3 billion in respect of vested GitHub equity awards and an indemnity 
escrow). The acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve more at 
every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of GitHub, 
and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences. The 
financial results of GitHub have been included in our consolidated financial 
statements since the date of the acquisition. GitHub is reported as part of our 
Intelligent Cloud segment.

The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of June 30, 
2019. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the 
purchase price were as follows:

  (In millions)                                                  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Cash, cash equivalents, and short-term investments        234  
  Goodwill                                                5,497  
  Intangible assets                                       1,267  
  Other assets                                              143  
  Other liabilities                                        (217  
  Total                                                   6,924  

The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily 
attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to 
be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Intelligent 
Cloud segment.

Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible 
assets acquired:

  (In millions)          Amount                           
  Customer-related       $             648      8 years

  Marketing-related                    170      10 years  
  Contract-based                         2      2 years   
  Total                  $           1,267      7 years   

Transactions recognized separately from the purchase price allocation were 
approximately $600 million, primarily related to equity awards recognized as 
expense over the related service period.

During fiscal year 2020, we completed 15 acquisitions for $2.4 billion, 
substantially all of which were paid in cash. These entities have been included 
in our consolidated results of operations since their respective acquisition 
dates. The effects of these business combinations, individually and in 
aggregate, were not material to our consolidated results of operations.
