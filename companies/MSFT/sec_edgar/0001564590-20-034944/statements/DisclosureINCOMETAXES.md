Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act(“TCJA”) was enacted into law, 
which significantly changed existing U. S. tax law and included numerous 
provisions that affect our business. We recorded a provisional net charge of 
$13.7 billion related to the enactment of the TCJA in fiscal year 2018, and 
adjusted the provisional net charge by recording additional tax expense of $157 
million in fiscal year 2019 pursuant to Securities and Exchange Commission Staff
Accounting Bulletin No. 118.

In fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently issued regulations, we
transferred certain intangible properties held by our foreign subsidiaries to 
the U. S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible properties resulted in a $2.6
billion net income tax benefit recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 
2019, as the value of future tax deductions exceeded the current tax liability 
from foreign jurisdictions and U. S. global intangible low-taxed income 
(“GILTI”) tax.

Effective Tax Rate

The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U. 
S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:

10.2%       54.6%  

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily 
due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from 
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign 
regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, and tax benefits 
relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory 
rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax 
benefit related to intangible property transfers, and earnings taxed at lower 
rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our 
products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in 
Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The increase from the federal statutory 
rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net charge related to the 
enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, offset in part 
by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. In fiscal year 2020, 
our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are 
taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, generated 86% of our foreign income 
before tax. In fiscal years 2019 and 2018, our foreign regional operating 
centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower 
than the U. S. rate, generated 82% and 87% of our foreign income before tax, 
respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and
GILTI tax. In fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, there were no individually 
significant other reconciling items.

The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2020 compared to fiscal 
year 2019 was primarily due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property transfers. The
decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal year 
2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in
the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income tax 
benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible property
transfers.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2020, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $547 million, $975 million, and $2.0 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years 
from fiscal 2021 through 2040, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss 
carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be 
realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be 
realized. In fiscal year 2020, we removed $2.0 billion of foreign net operating 
losses and corresponding valuation allowances as a result of the liquidation of 
a foreign subsidiary. There was no impact to our consolidated financial 
statements.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $12.5 billion, $8.4 billion, and $5.5 
billion in fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 
30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, were $13.8 billion, $13.1 billion, and $12.0 billion, 
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would 
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 by $12.1 
billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.3 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $4.0 billion, $3.4 billion, and $3.0 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for 
fiscal years 2020, 2019, and 2018 included interest expense related to uncertain
tax positions of $579 million, $515 million, and $688 million, respectively, net
of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years
2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 
Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of 
the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of 
the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under 
audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. In April 2020, the IRS commenced the audit for
tax years 2014 to 2017.

As of June 30, 2020, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to 
transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated 
financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances 
for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed 
assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of 
these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently 
available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax 
contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 
1996 to 2019, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. 
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our 
consolidated financial statements.
