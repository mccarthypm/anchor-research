| **  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA** | NOTE 19 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating 
decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain 
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements 
prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we 
reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity
and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

Our reportable segments are described below.

Productivity and Business Processes

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and 
services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information 
services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily 
comprises:

  Office Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions, the Office portion of 
Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises, 
comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Mi...  

  Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer (formerly Office 365 
Consumer) subscriptions and Office licensed on-premises, and Office Consumer

  LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Learning Solutions, Marketing Solutions,
Sales Solutions, and Premium Subscriptions.  

  Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based 
applications across ERP and CRM, Dynamics ERP on-premises, and Dynamics CRM 
on-premises.  

Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server
products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This 
segment primarily comprises:

  Server products and cloud services, including Azure; SQL Server, Windows 
Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs; and GitHub.  

  Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft 
Consulting Services.  

More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put 
customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment 
primarily comprises:

  Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the
Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the
Windows operating system, Windows...  

  Devices, including Surface and PC accessories.  

  Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising Xbox
Live ( transactions, subscriptions, cloud services, and advertising), video 
games, and third-party video game roya...  

  Search.  

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, 
due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and 
costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain 
contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the 
underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual 
prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit 
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative 
revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include 
those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple 
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable 
and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs 
include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information 
technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared 
facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is 
measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs 
being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our 
segments.

Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods 
presented:

Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A

an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately
identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included
in the measure of segment profit or loss.
