Refer to Note 5 - Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our 
derivative instruments.

Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments 
without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or 
measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or 
impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a 
practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of
June 30, 2024 and 2023, equity investments without readily determinable fair 
values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or 
impairments were $3.9 billion and $4.2 billion, respectively.

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to 
changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized 
losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.
