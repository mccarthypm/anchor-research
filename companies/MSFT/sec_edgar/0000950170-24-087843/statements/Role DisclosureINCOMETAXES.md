In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible 
properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U. S. The transfer of 
intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U. S. tax deductions 
exceeded the current tax liability from the U. S. global intangible low-taxed 
income (“GILTI”) tax.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2024 and 2023 is 
primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions 
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our 
foreign regional operations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal 
statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax 
benefit related to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at 
lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing 
our products and services through our foreign regional operations center in 
Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 
2024 and 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed 
at a rate lower than the U. S. rate, generated83% and81% of our foreign income 
before tax. In fiscal year 2022, our foreign regional operating centers in 
Ireland and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, 
generated71% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net 
consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2024, 
includes tax benefits from tax law changes. In fiscal year 2024, tax benefits 
from tax law changes primarily relates to the issuance of Notice 2023-55 and 
Notice 2023-80 by the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) and U. S. Treasury 
Department. Notice 2023-55, issued in the first quarter of fiscal year 2024, 
delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations to fiscal 
year 2024 for Microsoft. Notice 2023-80, issued in the second quarter of fiscal 
year 2024, further delayed the effective date of final foreign tax credit 
regulations indefinitely. In fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, there were no 
individually significant other reconciling items.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal 
year 2023 was primarily due to tax benefits from tax law changes, including the 
delay of the effective date of final foreign tax credit regulations. The 
increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal year 
2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible properties and
a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2024, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $476 million, $899 million, and $2.6 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates
ranging from fiscal year2025 to2044 or indefinite carryforward periods, if not 
utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not 
expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an 
annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those 
which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2024, we had $456 million 
federal capital loss carryforwards for U. S. tax purposes from our acquisition 
of Nuance. The federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to an annual 
limitation and will expire in fiscal year2025.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net 
deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $23.4 billion, $23.1 billion, and $16.0 
billion in fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 
30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, were $22.8 billion, $17.1 billion, and $15.6 billion, 
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would 
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 by $19.6 
billion, $14.4 billion, and $13.3 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2024, 2023, and 2022, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $6.8 billion, $5.2 billion, and $4.3 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for 
fiscal years 2024, 2023, and 2022 included interest expense related to uncertain
tax positions of $1.5 billion, $918 million, and $36 million, respectively, net 
of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

(a)

Fiscal year 2024 includes unrecognized tax benefits of $

3.4

billion related to the acquisition of Activision Blizzard. See Note 8 - Business
Combinations for further information.

We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years2014 to2017. With respect to the 
audit for tax years2004 to2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of 
Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs 
relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an 
additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 
30, 2024, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. 
We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs 
through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial 
proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 
months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a 
significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these 
issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax 
years1996 to2023, some of which are currently under audit by local tax 
authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be 
material to our consolidated financial statements.
