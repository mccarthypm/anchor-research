Activision Blizzard, Inc.

OnOctober 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. 
(“Activision Blizzard”) for a total purchase price of $75.4 billion, consisting 
primarily of cash. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an 
interactive entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will accelerate the
growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. The 
financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated 
financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is 
reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment.

The purchase price allocation as of the date of acquisition was based on a 
preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more detailed analyses are 
completed and additional information about the fair value of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed becomes available. The primary areas that remain preliminary
relate to the fair values of goodwill and income taxes.

The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily 
allocated the purchase price were as follows:

  (In millions)                           
 ──────────────────────────────────────────
  Cash and cash equivalents       12,976  
  Goodwill                        50,969  
  Intangible assets               21,969  
  Other assets                     2,501  
  Long-term debt                 ( 2,799  
  Long-term income taxes         ( 1,914  
  Deferred income taxes          ( 4,677  
  Other liabilities              ( 3,617  
  Total purchase price            75,408  

Goodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment. The goodwill was 
primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved 
from the integration of Activision Blizzard. Substantially all of the goodwill 
is expected to be non-deductible for income tax purposes.

Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible 
assets acquired:

  (In millions, except average life)            Amount                          
  Marketing-related                             $           11,619      24 years
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Technology-based                                           9,689      4 years 
  Customer-related                                             661      4 years 
  Fair value of intangible assets acquired      $           21,969      15 years

Following is the net impact of the Activision Blizzard acquisition on our 
consolidated income statements since the date of acquisition:

  (In millions)                     
  Year Ended June 30,         2024  
 ────────────────────────────────────
  Revenue                    5,729  
  Operating loss           ( 1,362  

The change of Activision Blizzard content from third-party to first-party is 
reflected in the net impact.

Following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of Microsoft 
Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been 
consummated on July 1, 2022:

  Year Ended June 30,                             2024         2023

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we 
believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized 
had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not 
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future 
periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase 
accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs and 
other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest 
period presented.

Nuance Communications, Inc.

OnMarch 4, 2022, we completed our acquisition of Nuance Communications, Inc. 
(“Nuance”) for a total purchase price of $18.8 billion, consisting primarily of

with healthcare and enterprise AI experience, and the acquisition will build on 
our industry-specific cloud offerings. The financial results of Nuance have been
included in our consolidated financial statements since the date of the 
acquisition. Nuance is reported as part of our Intelligent Cloud segment.
