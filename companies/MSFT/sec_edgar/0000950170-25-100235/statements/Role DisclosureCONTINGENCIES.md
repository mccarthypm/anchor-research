Irish Data Protection Commission Matter

In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a 
complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising 
practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data 
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of 
inquiry. In October 2024, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a final decision 
alleging GDPR violations and assessing a fine. In November 2024, LinkedIn 
appealed the final decision to the Irish courts, and the next hearing is 
scheduled for December 2025.

Other Contingencies

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time 
to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently 
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of 
these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2025, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $541 million. 
While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we 
estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded 
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated 
financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably 
estimable.
