The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U. 
S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:

18.2%        19.0%  

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 
2023 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions 
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our 
foreign regional operations center in Ireland. In fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 
2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a rate
lower than the U. S. rate, generated81%,83%, and81% of our foreign income before
tax. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits and the U. 
S. global intangible low-taxed income tax, and in fiscal year 2024, includes tax
benefits from tax law changes. In fiscal year 2024, tax benefits from tax law 
changes primarily relate to the delay of the effective date of final foreign tax
credit regulations. In fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, there were no 
individually significant other reconciling items.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2025 compared to fiscal 
year 2024 was due to changes in the mix of our earnings and tax expenses between
the U. S. and foreign countries. The decrease in our effective tax rate for 
fiscal year 2024 compared to fiscal year 2023 was primarily due to tax benefits 
from tax law changes, including the delay of the effective date of final foreign
tax credit regulations.

The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2025, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $390 million, $836 million, and $2.6 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates
ranging from fiscal year2026 to2045 or indefinite carryforward periods, if not 
utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not 
expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an 
annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those 
which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2025, we had $816 million 
federal capital loss carryforwards for U. S. tax purposes. The federal capital 
loss carryforwards will expire in fiscal year2030 if not utilized.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net 
deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $28.7 billion, $23.4 billion, and $23.1 
billion in fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 
30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, were $24.7 billion, $22.8 billion, and $17.1 billion, 
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would 
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 by $21.2 
billion, $19.6 billion, and $14.4 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2025, 2024, and 2023, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $8.2 billion, $6.8 billion, and $5.2 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for 
fiscal years 2025, 2024, and 2023 included interest expense related to uncertain
tax positions of $1.3 billion, $1.5 billion, and $918 million, respectively, net
of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We remain under audit by the IRS for tax years2014 to 2017. With respect to the 
audit for tax years2004 to 2013, on September 26, 2023, we received Notices of 
Proposed Adjustment (“NOPAs”) from the IRS. The primary issues in the NOPAs 
relate to intercompany transfer pricing. In the NOPAs, the IRS is seeking an 
additional tax payment of $28.9 billion plus penalties and interest. As of June 
30, 2025, we believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. 
We disagree with the proposed adjustments and will vigorously contest the NOPAs 
through the IRS’s administrative appeals office and, if necessary, judicial 
proceedings. We do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 
months. Based on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a 
significant increase or decrease to our income tax contingencies for these 
issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S., some of 
which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. The resolution of 
these audits is not expected to be material to our consolidated financial 
statements. Our operations in Ireland remain subject to examination for tax 
years2020 and thereafter.
