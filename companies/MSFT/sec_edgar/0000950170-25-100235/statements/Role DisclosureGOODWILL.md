We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally 
manage and monitor our business. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies for 
further information.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed 
as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. 
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts 
allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are 
determined.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations 
and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above.
Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between 
segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

As discussed in Note 1 - Accounting Policies, during the first quarter of fiscal
year 2025 we made changes to our segments. These segment changes also resulted 
in changes to our reporting units. We reallocated goodwill across impacted 
reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition, we completed 
an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for all reporting units 
immediately prior to the reallocation and determined that no impairment existed.

Goodwill Impairment

We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, 
primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, 
risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted 
cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the 
businesses.

No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2025, May 1, 2024, or 
May 1, 2023 tests. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, accumulated goodwill impairment
was $11.3 billion.
