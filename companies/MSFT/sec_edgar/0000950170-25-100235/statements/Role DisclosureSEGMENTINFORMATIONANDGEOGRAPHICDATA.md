| **  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA** | NOTE 18 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating 
decision maker (“CODM”), who is also ourChief Executive Officer, reviews certain
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements. 
The primary profitability measure used by the CODM to review segment operating 
results is operating income. The CODM uses operating income to allocate 
resources during our annual planning process and throughout the year, as well as
to assess the performance of our segments, primarily by monitoring actual 
results compared to prior periods and expected results. During the periods 
presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following 
segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More 
Personal Computing.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally 
manage and monitor our business. Refer to Note 1 - Accounting Policies for 
further information.

Our reportable segments are described below.

Productivity and Business Processes

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and 
services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information 
services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily 
comprises:

• Microsoft 365 Commercial products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 
Commercial cloud, comprising Microsoft 365 Commercial, Enterprise Mobility + 
Security, the cloud portion of Windows Commercial, the per-user portion of Power
BI, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Microsoft 365 Security and 
Compliance, and Microsoft 365 Copilot; and Microsoft 365 Commercial products, 
comprising Windows Commercial on-premises and Office licensed on-premises.

• Microsoft 365 Consumer products and cloud services, including Microsoft 365 
Consumer subscriptions, Office licensed on-premises, and other consumer 
services.

• LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium 
Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.

• Dynamics products and cloud services, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set
of intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM, Power Apps, and Power 
Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM applications.

Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server
products and cloud services that power modern business and developers. This 
segment primarily comprises:

• Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services, 
comprising cloud and AI consumption-based services, GitHub cloud services, 
Nuance Healthcare cloud services, virtual desktop offerings, and other cloud 
services; and Server products, comprising SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual 
Studio, System Center, related Client Access Licenses (“CALs”), and other 
on-premises offerings.

• Enterprise and partner services, including Enterprise Support Services, 
Industry Solutions, Nuance professional services, Microsoft Partner Network, and

More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put 
customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment 
primarily comprises:

• Windows and Devices, including Windows OEM licensing (Windows Pro and non-Pro 
licenses sold through the OEM channel) and Devices, comprising Surface and PC 
accessories.

• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising 
first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game 
Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, and other cloud 
services.

• Search and news advertising, comprising Bing and Copilot, Microsoft News, 
Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, 
due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and 
costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain 
contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the 
underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual 
prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit 
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative 
revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include 
those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple 
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to 
our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including 
settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise 
taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, 
and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is 
measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs 
being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative 
headcount.

Segment revenue, cost of revenue, operating expenses, and operating income were 
as follows during the periods presented:
