Refer to Note 5 - Derivatives for further information on the fair value of our 
derivative instruments.

Equity investments presented as “Other” in the tables above include investments 
without readily determinable fair values measured at cost with adjustments for 
observable changes in price or impairments, measured using the equity method, or
measured at fair value using net asset value as a practical expedient which are 
not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, 
equity investments without readily determinable fair values measured at cost 
with adjustments for observable changes in price or impairments were $2.9 
billion and $3.9 billion, respectively. Equity investments measured using the 
equity method were $6.0 billion as of both June 30, 2025 and 2024.

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to 
changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized 
losses represent impairments based on our evaluation of available evidence.
