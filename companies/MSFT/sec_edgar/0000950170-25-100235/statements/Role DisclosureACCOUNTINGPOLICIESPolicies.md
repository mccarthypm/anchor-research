| **  Recast of Certain Prior Period Information** | Recast of Certain Prior Period Information

In August 2024, we announced changes to the composition of our segments. These 
changes align our segments with how we currently manage our business, most 
notably bringing the commercial components of Microsoft 365 together in the 
Productivity and Business Processes segment. Beginning in fiscal year 2025, the 
information that our chief operating decision maker is regularly provided and 
reviews for purposes of allocating resources and assessing performance reflects 
these segment changes. Prior period segment information has been recast to 
conform to the way we internally manage and monitor our business during fiscal 
year 2025. These changes primarily impacted Note 8 - Goodwill, Note 12 - 
Unearned Revenue, and Note 18 - Segment Information and Geographic Data.

The recast of prior period information had no impact on our consolidated balance
sheets, consolidated income statements, or consolidated cash flows statements.

|   Estimates and Assumptions | Estimates and Assumptions

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, 
and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue 
recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance 
obligations, and determining the standalone selling price ("SSP") of performance
obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as product 
returns and refunds; loss contingencies; the fair value of and/or potential 
impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our reporting units; product 
life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for 
doubtful accounts; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when technological
feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of uncertain tax
positions that have been recognized in our consolidated financial statements or 
tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments for 
investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates 
and assumptions due to risks and uncertainties.

| **  Foreign Currencies** | Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at 
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments 
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income.

Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue

Product revenue includes sales from operating systems, cross-device productivity
and collaboration applications, server applications, business solution 
applications, desktop and server management tools, software development tools, 
video games, and hardware such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment 
consoles, other intelligent devices, and related accessories.

Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide
customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Office 365, 
Azure, Dynamics 365, and gaming; solution support; and consulting services. 
Service and other revenue also includes sales from online advertising and 
LinkedIn.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services 
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive 
in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can 
include various combinations of products and services, which are generally 
capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from
customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Nature of Products and Services

Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the 
software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may 
purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers 
with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the 
customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses 
is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available 
to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, 
primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is 
recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the 
estimated life of the related device or license.

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract 
period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a 
subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on
a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue 
related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of
storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of 
such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration 
and interdependency with software and the individual components are not 
considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the 
cloud services are provided.

Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include 
on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“SA”). SA conveys rights 
to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides 
support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more 
efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance 
obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized 
ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive
benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are 
satisfied over time.

Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in 
the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been 
completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are 
provided.

Our hardware is generally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the 
underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In
these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single 
performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when 
ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through 
retail stores and online marketplaces.

Refer to Note 18 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further 
information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.

Significant Judgments

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple 
products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services 
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for 
separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based 
service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment
is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and
accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the 
cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office
365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and 
interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are 
accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is
recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance 
obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold 
separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates 
provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when
we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine 
whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the 
various products and services.

In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell 
the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that 
may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have 
more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification
of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these 
instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and 
geographic region in determining the SSP.

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is 
required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of 
certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other 
credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of 
our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration 
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are 
estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period 
if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable 
consideration were not material for the periods presented.

Contract Balances and Other Receivables

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to 
customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing,
or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For 
multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning 
of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue 
recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right
to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.

Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing 
programs, which may include cloud services and SA. Unearned revenue is generally
invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year 
agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue 
also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future, 
LinkedIn subscriptions, Office 365 subscriptions, Xbox subscriptions, Windows 
post-delivery support, Dynamics business solutions, and other offerings for 
which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control
of the product or service.

Refer to Note 12 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned 
revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally 
include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the 
timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have 
determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing 
component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers 
with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, 
not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with 
financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term 
with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year 
on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.

As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance 
for doubtful accounts, was $5.2 billion and $4.9 billion, respectively, and is 
included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, other receivables related to activities to 
facilitate the purchase of server components were $8.2 billion and $10.5 
billion, respectively, and are included in other current assets in our 
consolidated balance sheets.

We record financing receivables when we offer certain customers the option to 
acquire our software products and services offerings through a financing program
in a limited number of countries. As of June 30, 2025 and 2024, our financing 
receivables, net were $4.3 billion and $4.5 billion, respectively, for 
short-term and long-term financing receivables, which are included in other 
current assets and other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

We record an allowance for doubtful accounts which reflects our best estimate of
credit losses inherent in the accounts receivable and financing receivable 
balances. We determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts, 
historical experience, and other currently available evidence.

Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a 
customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We 
have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to 
be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial 
during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term 
assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain 
a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year
or less. These costs include our internal sales organization compensation 
program and certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined 
annual compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.
 |  |  |
| **  Cost of Revenue** | Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes: costs incurred to support and maintain cloud-based and
other online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; 
manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs licensed; 
operating costs related to product support service centers and product 
distribution centers; traffic acquisition costs to drive traffic to our websites
and to acquire online advertising space; and costs associated with the delivery 
of consulting services.
 |  |  |
| **  Research and Development** | Research and Development

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, 
stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses 
associated with product development. Research and development expenses also 
include third-party development and programming costs and the depreciation and 
amortization of assets used to conduct research and development. Such costs 
related to software development are included in research and development expense
until the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our 
software products is generally shortly before the products are released to 
production. Once technological feasibility is reached, such costs are 
capitalized and amortized to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the 
products.
 |  |  |
| **  Sales and Marketing** | Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based 
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales
and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, 
seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 
Advertising expense was $2.1 billion, $1.7 billion, and $904 million in fiscal 
years 2025, 2024, and 2023, respectively.
 |  |  |
|   Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units 
(“RSUs”) and performance stock units (“PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on 
the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based 
on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value
of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the 
fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for 
RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized 
using the accelerated method.

Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ESPP”) is measured 
as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in 
the period of purchase.
 |  |  |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes U. S. and international income taxes, and interest 
and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not 
reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax 
effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. 
Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more 
likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income 
taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.
 |  |  |
| **  Investments** | Investments

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of 
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair 
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, 
investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining 
maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. 
Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term 
based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities 
represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.

Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and 
losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair 
value, excluding credit losses and impairments, are recorded in other 
comprehensive income. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available 
market information or other estimates determined by management. If the cost of 
an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general 
market conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, and the extent to 
which the fair value is less than cost. To determine credit losses, we employ a 
systematic methodology that considers available quantitative and qualitative 
evidence. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the 
financial health of, and business outlook for, the investee. If we have plans to
sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to sell
the security before recovery, then a decline in fair value below cost is 
recorded as an impairment charge in other income (expense), net and a new cost 
basis in the investment is established. If market, industry, and/or investee 
conditions deteriorate, we may incur future impairments.

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair 
value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured 
using the equity method or measured at cost with adjustments for observable 
changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We
perform a qualitative assessment on a periodic basis and recognize an impairment
if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the investment is less
than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other income (expense), 
net.

Investments that are considered variable interest entities (“VIEs”) are 
evaluated to determine whether we are the primary beneficiary of the VIE, in 
which case we would be required to consolidate the entity. We evaluate whether 
we have (1) the power to direct the activities that most significantly impact 
the VIE’s economic performance, and (2) the obligation to absorb losses or the 
right to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to 
the VIE. We have determined we are not the primary beneficiary of any of our VIE
investments. Therefore, our VIE investments are not consolidated and the 
majority are accounted for under the equity method of accounting. We have an 
investment in OpenAI Global, LLC (“OpenAI”) and have made total funding 
commitments of $13 billion. The investment is accounted for under the equity 
method of accounting.
 |  |  |
| **  Derivatives** | Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and 
measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a 
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting 
designation.

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are
recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on 
the hedged items. Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from 
the assessment of effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, gains and losses are 
initially reported as a component of other comprehensive income and subsequently
recognized in other income (expense), net with the corresponding hedged item. 
Gains and losses representing hedge components excluded from the assessment of 
effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses 
from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), 
net.
 |  |  |
|   Fair Value Measurements | Fair Value Measurements

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below
lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in 
measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our 
fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These 
levels are:

• Level 1
 - inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical instruments in 
active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U. S. government securities, 
common and preferred stock, and mutual funds. Our Level 1 derivative assets and 
liabilities include those actively traded on exchanges.

• Level 2
 - inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active 
markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets that are 
not active, and model-based valuation techniques (e. g. the Black-Scholes model)
for which all significant inputs are observable in the market or can be 
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the 
assets or liabilities. Where applicable, these models project future cash flows 
and discount the future amounts to a present value using market-based observable
inputs including interest rate curves, credit spreads, foreign exchange rates, 
and forward and spot prices for currencies. Our Level 2 investments include 
commercial paper, certificates of deposit, U. S. agency securities, foreign 
government bonds, mortgage- and asset-backed securities, corporate notes and 
bonds, and municipal securities. Our Level 2 derivative assets and liabilities 
include certain cleared swap contracts and over-the-counter forward, option, and
swap contracts.

• Level 3
 - inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s 
estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The fair values are therefore determined using model-based 
techniques, including option pricing models and discounted cash flow models. Our
Level 3 assets and liabilities include investments in corporate notes and bonds,
municipal securities, and goodwill and intangible assets, when they are recorded
at fair value due to an impairment charge. Unobservable inputs used in the 
models are significant to the fair values of the assets and liabilities.

We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a 
nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on
valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include 
quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.

Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair 
values that approximate their carrying values.
 |  |  |
| **  Property and Equipment** | Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and 
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated 
useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our 
property and equipment are generally as follows: software developed or acquired 
for internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to six years; buildings 
and improvements, five to15 years; leasehold improvements, three to15 years; and
furniture and equipment, one to10 years. Land is not depreciated.
 |  |  |
| **  Leases** | Leases

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are 
included in operating lease right-of-use (“ROU”) assets, other current 
liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current 
liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and
lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from 
the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at 
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease 
term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use 
our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for 
collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at 
commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease 
payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options
to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will 
exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are 
generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as 
vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease 
component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio 
approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and 
liabilities.
 |  |  |
|   Goodwill | Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment
or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1) and between 
annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely 
than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.
 |  |  |
|   Intangible Assets | Intangible Assets

Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized over the 
estimated useful life in proportion to the economic benefits received. We 
evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into 
account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful 
lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.
 |  |  |
| **  Related Party Transactions** | Related Party Transactions

In March 2024, we entered into an agreement with Inflection AI, Inc. 
(“Inflection”), pursuant to which we obtained a non-exclusive license to 
Inflection’s intellectual property. Reid Hoffman, a member of our Board of 
Directors, is a co-founder of and serves on the board of directors of 
Inflection. As of the date of the agreement with Inflection, Reprogrammed 
Interchange LLC (“Reprogrammed”) and entities affiliated with Greylock Ventures 
(“Greylock”) each held less than a10% equity interest in Inflection. Mr. Hoffman
may be deemed to beneficially own the shares held by Reprogrammed and Greylock 
by virtue of his relationship with such entities. Mr. Hoffman did not 
participate in any portions of the meetings of our Board of Directors or any 
committee thereof to review and approve the transaction with Inflection.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

Segment Reporting - Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued a new
standard to improve reportable segment disclosures. The guidance expands the 
disclosures required for reportable segments in our annual and interim 
consolidated financial statements, primarily through enhanced disclosures about 
significant segment expenses. We adopted the standard beginning with our annual 
reporting for fiscal year 2025. The adoption resulted in incremental segment 
reporting disclosures, most notably disclosure of cost of revenue and operating 
expenses for each reportable segment. Refer to Note 18 - Segment Information and
Geographic Data.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

Income Taxes - Improvements to Income Tax Disclosures

In December 2023, the FASB issued a new standard to improve income tax 
disclosures. The guidance requires disclosure of disaggregated income taxes 
paid, prescribes standardized categories for the components of the effective tax
rate reconciliation, and modifies other income tax-related disclosures. The 
standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal
year 2026, with early adoption permitted. We are currently evaluating the impact
of this standard on our income tax disclosures.

Income Statement - Disaggregation of Income Statement Expenses

In November 2024, the FASB issued a new standard to expand disclosures about 
income statement expenses. The guidance requires disaggregation of certain costs
and expenses included in each relevant expense caption on our consolidated 
income statements in a separate note to the financial statements at each interim
and annual reporting period, including amounts of purchases of inventory, 
employee compensation, depreciation, and intangible asset amortization. The 
standard will be effective for us beginning with our annual reporting for fiscal
year 2028 and interim periods thereafter, with early adoption permitted. We are 
currently evaluating the impact of this standard on our disclosures.
 |  |  |
| **  Earnings Per Share** | Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average 
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is 
computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the
effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using 
the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding 
stock options and stock awards.
 |  |  |
| **  Segment Reporting** | Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, 
due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and 
costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain 
contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the 
underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual 
prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit 
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative 
revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include 
those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple 
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to 
our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including 
settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise 
taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, 
and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is 
measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs 
being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative 
headcount.

Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A 
portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in
an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately
identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included
in the measure of segment profit or loss.
