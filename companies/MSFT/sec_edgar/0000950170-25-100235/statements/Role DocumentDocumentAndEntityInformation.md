| **      Auditor Opinion [Text Block]** | Opinion on the Financial Statements

We have audited the accompanying consolidated balance sheets of Microsoft 
Corporation and subsidiaries (the "Company") as of June 30, 2025 and 2024, the 
related consolidated statements of income, comprehensive income, cash flows, and
stockholders' equity, for each of the three years in the period ended June 30, 
2025, and the related notes (collectively referred to as the "financial 
statements"). In our opinion, the financial statements present fairly, in all 
material respects, the financial position of the Company as of June 30, 2025 and
2024, and the results of its operations and its cash flows for each of the three
years in the period ended June 30, 2025, in conformity with accounting 
principles generally accepted in the United States of America.

We have also audited, in accordance with the standards of the Public Company 
Accounting Oversight Board (United States) (PCAOB), the Company's internal 
control over financial reporting as of June 30, 2025, based on criteria 
established inInternal Control - Integrated Framework (2013) issued by the 
Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway Commission and our report 
dated July 30, 2025, expressed an unqualified opinion on the Company's internal 
control over financial reporting.
