Activision Blizzard, Inc.

OnOctober 13, 2023, we completed our acquisition of Activision Blizzard, Inc. 
(“Activision Blizzard”) for a total purchase price of $75.4 billion, consisting 
primarily of cash. Activision Blizzard is a leader in game development and an 
interactive entertainment content publisher. The acquisition will accelerate the
growth in our gaming business across mobile, PC, console, and cloud gaming. The 
financial results of Activision Blizzard have been included in our consolidated 
financial statements since the date of the acquisition. Activision Blizzard is 
reported as part of our More Personal Computing segment.

The allocation of the purchase price to the assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed was completed as of September 30, 2024. The major classes of assets and 
liabilities to which we have allocated the purchase price were as follows:

  (In millions)                           
 ──────────────────────────────────────────
  Cash and cash equivalents       12,976  
  Goodwill                        51,001  
  Intangible assets               21,969  
  Other assets                     2,503  
  Long-term debt                 ( 2,799  
  Long-term income taxes         ( 1,946  
  Deferred income taxes          ( 4,676  
  Other liabilities              ( 3,620  
  Total purchase price            75,408  

Goodwill was assigned to our More Personal Computing segment. The goodwill was 
primarily attributed to increased synergies that are expected to be achieved 
from the integration of Activision Blizzard. Substantially all of the goodwill 
is expected to be non-deductible for income tax purposes.

Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible 
assets acquired:

  (In millions, except average life)            Amount                          
  Marketing-related                             $           11,619      24 years
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Technology-based                                           9,689      4 years 
  Customer-related                                             661      4 years

Following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of Microsoft 
Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been 
consummated on July 1, 2022:

  Year Ended June 30,                             2024         2023  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  (In millions, except per share amounts)                            
  Revenue                                      247,442      219,790

  Diluted earnings per share                     11.82         9.55  

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we 
believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized 
had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not 
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future 
periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase 
accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs and 
other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest 
period presented.
