Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average 
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is 
computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the
effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using 
the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding 
stock options and stock awards.

The components of basic and diluted EPS were as follows:
