Share Repurchases

On September 16,
2013, our Board of Directors approved a share repurchase program
authorizing up to $40.0 billion in share repurchases. The share
repurchase program became effective on October 1, 2013, has no
expiration date, and may be suspended or discontinued at any time
without notice. This share repurchase program replaced the share
repurchase program that was announced on September 22, 2008
and expired on September 30, 2013. As of June 30, 2015,
$21.9 billion remained of our $40.0 billion share repurchase
program. All repurchases were made using cash resources.
