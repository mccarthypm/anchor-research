We estimate that we have
no significant residual value related to our intangible assets.
During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2
billion related to our Phone Hardware intangible assets. In the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested the intangible assets
for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances
associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced
profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results
of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the
intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was
recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying
value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to
determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the
amount of impairment. These intangible assets impairment charges
were included in impairment, integration, and restructuring
expenses in our consolidated income statement, and reflected in
Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by
segment group in Note 22 - Segment Information and Geographic
Data. No material impairments of intangible assets were identified
during fiscal year 2014.

The components of
intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as
follows:
