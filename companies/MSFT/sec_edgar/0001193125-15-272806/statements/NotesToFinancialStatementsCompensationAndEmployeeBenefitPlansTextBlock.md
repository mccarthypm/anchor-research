Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

We have an employee stock
purchase plan (the “ Plan”) for all eligible employees.
Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at
three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last
trading day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase
shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation
during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares
during the periods presented:

  (Shares in millions)

At June 30, 2015,
157 million shares of our common stock were reserved for
future issuance through the Plan.

Savings Plan

We have a savings plan in
the U. S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international
locations. Participating U. S. employees may contribute up to 75% of
their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute
fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant
contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser
of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS
compensation limit for the given year. Matching contributions for
all plans were $454 million, $420 million, and $393 million in
fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively, and were expensed
as contributed. Matching contributions in the U. S. plan are
invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary
contributions in the investment options provided under the plan.
Investment options in the U. S. plan include Microsoft common stock,
but neither participant nor our matching contributions are required
to be invested in Microsoft common stock.
