RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Phone Hardware
Integration

In July 2014, we
announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and
align NDS with our company’s overall strategy (the
“ Phone Hardware Integration Plan”). Pursuant to the
Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated approximately 19,000
positions in fiscal year 2015, including approximately 13,000
professional and factory positions related to the NDS business. The
actions associated with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan were
completed as of June 30, 2015.

In connection with the
Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred restructuring charges
of $1.3 billion during fiscal year 2015, including severance
expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with
our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain
assets.

Phone Hardware
Restructuring

In June 2015, management
approved a plan to restructure our Phone Hardware business to
better focus and align resources (the “ Phone Hardware
Restructuring Plan”), under which we will eliminate up to
7,800 positions in fiscal year 2016. In connection with the Phone
Hardware Restructuring Plan, we recorded restructuring charges of
$780 million during fiscal year 2015, including severance expenses
and other reorganization costs, primarily related to contractual
obligations. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware
Restructuring Plan are expected to be completed as of June 30,
2016.

Restructuring charges
associated with each plan were included in impairment, integration,
and restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement,
and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating
income (loss) by segment group in Note 22 - Segment
Information and Geographic Data.

Changes in the
restructuring liability were as follows:
