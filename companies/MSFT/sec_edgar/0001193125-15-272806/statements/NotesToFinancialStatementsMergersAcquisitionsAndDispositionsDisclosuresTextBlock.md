COMBINATIONS

Mojang Synergies AB

On November 6, 2014, we acquired
Mojang Synergies AB (“ Mojang”), the Swedish video game
developer of the Minecraft gaming franchise, for $2.5 billion in
cash, net of cash acquired. The addition of Minecraft and its
community enhances our gaming portfolio across Windows, Xbox, and
other ecosystems besides our own. Our purchase price allocation is
preliminary and subject to revision as more detailed analyses are
completed and additional information about fair value of assets and
liabilities becomes available, including additional information
relating to tax matters and finalization of our valuation of
identified intangible assets.

The significant classes of assets and
liabilities to which we preliminarily allocated the purchase price
were goodwill of $1.8 billion and identifiable intangible assets of
$928 million, primarily marketing-related (trade names). The
goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily
attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth, and is
not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the
goodwill to our Devices and Consumer (“ D& C”) Other
segment. Identifiable intangible assets were assigned a total
weighted-average amortization period of 6.3 years. Mojang has been
included in our consolidated results of operations since the
acquisition date.

Nokia’s Devices and Services
Business

On April 25, 2014, we acquired
substantially all of Nokia Corporation’s
(“ Nokia”) Devices and Services business
(“ NDS”) for a total purchase price of $9.4 billion,
including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (the
“ Acquisition”). The purchase price consisted primarily
of cash of $7.1 billion and Nokia’s repurchase of convertible
notes of $2.1 billion, which was a non-cash transaction, and
liabilities assumed of $0.2 billion. The Acquisition was expected
to accelerate the growth of our D& C business through faster
innovation, synergies, and unified branding and
marketing.

The allocation of the purchase price
to goodwill was completed as of March 31, 2015. The major
classes of assets and liabilities to which we have allocated the
purchase price were as follows:

  (In millions)

  Cash                         1,506

Following are the details of the
purchase price allocated to the intangible assets
acquired:

  (In millions)                        Amount

  Customer-related                                   359      3 years  
  Marketing-related (trade                           157      2 years  
  Fair value of intangible assets      $           4,509      8 years  

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2015, we recorded $7.5 billion of goodwill and asset
impairment charges related to our Phone Hardware business. These
costs are included in impairment, integration, and restructuring
expenses in our consolidated income statement. See Note 10 - 
Goodwill and Note 11 - Intangible Assets for additional
details.

Our consolidated income statement for
fiscal year 2014 included revenue and operating loss of $2.0
billion and $692 million, respectively, attributable to NDS since
the Acquisition.

Following are the supplemental
consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation on an unaudited pro
forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been consummated on
July 1, 2012:

  Year Ended June 30,                          2014                  2013       
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
────────
  (In millions, except per share amounts)                                       
  Revenue                                      $         96,248      $         
93,243  
  Net income                                   $         20,234      $

  Diluted earnings per share                   $           2.41      $          
2.38  

These pro forma results were based on
estimates and assumptions, which we believe are reasonable. They
are not the results that would have been realized had we been a
combined company during the periods presented and are not
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in
future periods. The pro forma results include adjustments primarily
related to purchase accounting adjustments and the elimination of
related party transactions between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition
costs and other nonrecurring charges incurred are included in the
earliest period presented.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2014, we incurred $21 million of acquisition costs associated
with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition costs are primarily comprised
of transaction fees and direct acquisition costs, including legal,
finance, consulting, and other professional fees. These costs are
included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on
our consolidated income statement for fiscal year
2014.

Certain concurrent transactions were
recognized separately from the Acquisition. Prior to the
Acquisition, we had joint strategic initiatives with Nokia; this
contractual relationship was terminated in conjunction with the
Acquisition. No gain or loss was recorded upon termination of this
agreement, as it was determined to be at market value. In addition,
we agreed to license Nokia’s mapping services and will pay
Nokia separately for the services provided under a four-year
license as they are rendered.

Yammer

On July 18, 2012, we acquired
Yammer, Inc. (“ Yammer”), a leading provider of
enterprise social networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. Yammer added
an enterprise social networking service to Microsoft’s
portfolio of complementary cloud-based services. The major classes
of assets to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of
$937 million and identifiable intangible assets of $178 million. We
assigned the goodwill to Commercial Other under our current segment
structure. Yammer was consolidated into our results of operations
starting on the acquisition date.

Other

During fiscal year 2015, we completed
15 additional acquisitions for total cash consideration of $892
million. These entities have been included in our consolidated
results of operations since their respective acquisition
dates.

Pro forma results of operations for
Mojang and our other acquisitions during the current period have
not been presented because the effects of these business
combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to
our consolidated results of operations.
