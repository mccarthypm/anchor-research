The items accounting for
the difference between income taxes computed at the U. S. federal
statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:

  Year Ended June 30,

  Phone Hardware nondeductible charges        19.1%         0.9%           0%

The reduction from the
federal statutory rate is primarily due to foreign earnings taxed
at lower rates resulting from producing and distributing our
products and services through our foreign regional operations
centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. In fiscal year
2015, this reduction was mostly offset by losses in foreign
jurisdictions for which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily
as a result of impairment and restructuring charges. Excluding
these losses, our foreign earnings, which are taxed at rates lower
than the U. S. rate and are generated from our regional operating
centers, were 73%, 81%, and 79% of our foreign income before tax in
fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, respectively. In general, other
reconciling items consist of interest, U. S. state income taxes, and
credits. In fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013, there were no
individually significant other reconciling items.

The components of the
deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as
follows:

As of June 30, 2015,
we had net operating loss carryforwards of $4.6 billion, including
$1.8 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards acquired
through our acquisition of Skype, and $545 million through our
acquisition of NDS. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table
above relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and
other future deductible net deferred tax assets that may not be
realized.

Deferred income tax
balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the
taxes are actually paid or recovered.

As of June 30, 2015,
we have not provided deferred U. S. income taxes or foreign
withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $108.3
billion resulting from earnings for certain non-U. S. subsidiaries
which are permanently reinvested outside the U. S. The unrecognized
deferred tax liability associated with these temporary differences
was approximately $34.5 billion at June 30, 2015.

Income taxes paid were
$4.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $3.9 billion in fiscal years 2015,
2014, and 2013, respectively.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

Unrecognized tax benefits
as of June 30, 2015, 2014, and 2013, were $9.6 billion, $8.7
billion, and $8.6 billion, respectively. If recognized, these tax
benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years
2015, 2014, and 2013, by $7.9 billion, $7.0 billion, and $6.5
billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2015,
2014, and 2013, we had accrued interest expense related to
uncertain tax positions of $1.7 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.3
billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest
expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $237 million, $235
million, and $400 million in fiscal years 2015, 2014, and 2013,
respectively, and was included in income tax expense.

The aggregate changes in
the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as
follows:

During the third quarter
of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a portion of an
I. R. S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced our income
tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion of the
I. R. S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In February
2012, the I. R. S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report and
reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30,
2015, the primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing,
which could have a significant impact on our consolidated financial
statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our allowances for
income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a
proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a
final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months.  Based
on the information currently available, we do not anticipate a
significant increase or decrease to our tax contingencies for these
issues within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to
examination by the I. R. S. for tax years 2007 to 2015.

We are subject to income
tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our operations in
certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years
1996 to 2015, some of which are currently under audit by local tax
authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be
material to our consolidated financial statements.
