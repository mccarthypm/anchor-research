Indemnifications

We provide
indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers
against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third
parties arising from the use of our products and certain other
matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications,
and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate
of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant
costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any
liabilities related to these indemnifications in our consolidated
financial statements.
