  (a)      Goodwill acquired during fiscal year 2014 related to the    

The measurement periods
for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities assumed end as
soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed as
of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12
months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a
recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the
periods in which the acquisitions occurred.

Any change in the
goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations and
purchase accounting adjustments are presented as
“ Other” in the above table. Also included in
“ Other” are business dispositions and transfers between
business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable. For fiscal
year 2015, a $5.1 billion goodwill impairment charge was included
in “ Other,” as discussed further below. This goodwill
impairment charge was included in impairment, integration, and
restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement, and
reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of operating income
(loss) by segment group in Note 22 - Segment Information and
Geographic Data.

Our accumulated goodwill
impairment as of June 30, 2015 and 2014 was $11.3 billion and
$6.2 billion, respectively.

Goodwill Impairment

We test goodwill for
impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level,
primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a
peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We
believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable
indicator of the fair values of the businesses.

Upon completion of the
annual testing as of May 1, 2015, Phone Hardware goodwill was
determined to be impaired. In the second half of fiscal year 2015,
Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and revenue goals, and
the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These
results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an
evaluation of business priorities, led to a shift in strategic
direction and reduced future revenue and profitability expectations
for the business. As a result of these changes in strategy and
expectations, we have forecasted reductions in unit volume growth
rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value
of the Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the
determination that an impairment adjustment was
required.

Because our annual test
indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying value exceeded its
estimated fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment
test (“ Step 2”) was performed specific to Phone
Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware assets
and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing
technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for
the purpose of deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of
goodwill. The implied fair value of the goodwill was then compared
to the recorded goodwill to determine the amount of the impairment.
Assumptions used in measuring the value of these assets and
liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in
valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market
environment in valuing the tangible assets.

No other instances of
impairment were identified in our May 1, 2015 test. No
impairment of goodwill was identified as of May 1,
2014.
