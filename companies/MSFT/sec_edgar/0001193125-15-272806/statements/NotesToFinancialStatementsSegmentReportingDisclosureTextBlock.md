SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the
business, management, including our chief operating decision maker,
the company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss
statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U. S. GAAP. The
segment information in this note is reported on that basis. During
the periods presented, we reported our financial performance based
on the following segments; D& C Licensing, Computing and Gaming
Hardware, Phone Hardware, D& C Other, Commercial Licensing, and
Commercial Other.

On April 25, 2014,
we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note 9 - Business
Combinations for additional details. NDS has been included in our
consolidated results of operations since the acquisition date. We
report the financial performance of the acquired business in our
Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the acquisition of NDS, financial
results associated with our joint strategic initiatives with Nokia
were reflected in our D& C Licensing segment. The contractual
relationship with Nokia related to those initiatives ended in
conjunction with the acquisition.

Our reportable segments
are described below.

Devices and
Consumer

Our D& C segments
develop, manufacture, market, and support products and services
designed to entertain and connect people, increase personal
productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more informed
decisions online, and help advertisers connect with audiences. Our
D& C segments are:

  D& C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all                

  Computing and Gaming Hardware, comprising: Xbox gaming         

  Phone Hardware, comprising: Lumia phones and other        

  D& C Other, comprising: Resale, consisting of                        

Commercial

Our Commercial segments
develop, market, and support software and services designed to
increase individual, team, and organizational productivity and
efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks through seamless
operations across the user’s hardware and software. Our
Commercial segments are:

  Commercial Licensing, comprising: server products,                  

  Commercial Other, comprising: Enterprise Services,                   

Revenue and cost of
revenue are generally directly attributed to our segments. Certain
revenue contracts are allocated among the segments based on the
relative value of the underlying products and services, which can
include allocation based on actual prices charged, prices when sold
separately, or estimated costs plus a profit margin. Cost of
revenue is directly charged to our hardware segments. For the
remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly charged in most
cases and allocated in certain cases, generally using a relative
revenue methodology.

We do not allocate
operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate them to our
two segment groups, Devices and Consumer and Commercial. Due to the
integrated structure of our business, allocations of expenses are
made in certain cases to incent cross-collaboration among our
segment groups so that a segment group is not solely burdened by
the cost of a mutually beneficial activity as we seek to deliver
seamless experiences across devices, whether on-premises or in the
cloud.

Operating expenses are
attributed to our segment groups as follows:

  Sales                                                           

  Research and development expenses are primarily shared across     

  General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated  

Certain corporate-level
activity is not allocated to our segment groups, including costs
of: legal, including expenses, settlements, and fines; information
technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; and impairment,
integration, and restructuring expenses.

Segment revenue and gross
margin were as follows during the periods presented:
