In addition to the
investments in the table above, we also own corporate notes that
are classified as held-to-maturity investments, which are included
in equity and other investments on the balance sheet.  These
corporate notes are due October 31, 2023 and are measured at
fair value on a nonrecurring basis. As of June 30, 2015, the
amortized cost and recorded basis of these corporate notes were
both $25 million with an estimated fair value that approximates the
carrying value. As of June 30, 2014, the amortized cost,
recorded basis, and estimated fair value of these corporate notes
was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7 billion, respectively,
while their associated gross unrealized holding gains were $164
million.

As of June 30, 2015
and 2014, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are
restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were
$561 million and $520 million, respectively. These investments are
carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of
other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to
reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.

We lend certain
fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the
loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our
balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as
collateral for the loaned securities with the amount determined
based upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of
the borrower. As of June 30, 2015, collateral received under these
agreements totaled $92 million which is comprised of $79 million of
certificates of deposit and $13 million of U. S. government and
agency securities. The contractual maturities of these agreements
are primarily on a continuous and overnight basis.

Unrealized Losses on
Investments

Investments with
continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months
or greater and their related fair values were as
follows:

Unrealized losses from
fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in
interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international
equities are due to market price movements. Management does not
believe any remaining unrealized losses represent
other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of
available evidence as of June 30, 2015.
