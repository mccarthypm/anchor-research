Patent and Intellectual Property
Claims

Motorola litigation

In October 2010,
Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola
Mobility (“ Motorola”) with the International Trade
Commission (“ ITC”) and in U. S. District Court in
Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by
Motorola’s Android devices. Microsoft and Motorola have filed
additional claims against each other with the ITC, in federal
district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and
in courts in Germany. The nature of the claims asserted and status
of individual matters are summarized below.

International Trade
Commission

In 2012, the ITC issued a
limited exclusion order against Motorola on one Microsoft patent,
which was affirmed on appeal. In 2013, Microsoft filed an action in
U. S. District Court in Washington, D. C. seeking an order to compel
enforcement of the ITC’s 2012 import ban against infringing
Motorola products by the Bureau of Customs and Border Protection
(“ CBP”), after learning that CBP had failed to fully
enforce the order.

In 2010, Motorola filed
an action against Microsoft with the ITC alleging infringement of
five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and accessories and seeking
an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly
infringing Xbox products. At Motorola’s request, the ITC
terminated its investigation of four Motorola patents. In 2013, the
ITC affirmed there was no violation of the remaining Motorola
patent. Motorola appealed the ITC’s decision to the U. S.
Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit.

U. S. District Court

The Seattle District
Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion to
Microsoft’s ITC case against Motorola was stayed pending the
outcome of the ITC case.

In November 2010,
Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U. S. District
Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola breached its commitments
to standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain
patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory (“ RAND”)
terms and conditions. Motorola has declared these patents essential
to the implementation of the H.264 video standard and the 802.11
Wi-Fi standard. In the Motorola ITC case described above and in
suits described below, Motorola or a Motorola affiliate
subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U. S. District
Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In 2012, the Seattle District
Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft
ruling that (1)  Motorola had committed to standards
organizations to license its declared-essential patents on RAND
terms and conditions; and (2)  Microsoft is a third-party
beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the Seattle District
Court set per unit royalties for Motorola’s H.264 and 802.11
patents, which resulted in an immaterial Microsoft liability. In
2013, following trial of Microsoft’s breach of contract
claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages to Microsoft.
Motorola appealed with respect to both the Court’s
determination of royalties due Motorola and the jury’s award
of damages against Motorola; in July 2015 the U. S. Court of Appeals
for the Ninth Circuit affirmed the trial court’s judgment in
all respects.

Cases filed by Motorola
in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the exception of one
case in Wisconsin initially stayed and later dismissed without
prejudice (a companion case to Motorola’s ITC action), have
been transferred to the U. S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and
Microsoft both seek damages as well as injunctive relief. The court
has stayed these cases in Seattle on agreement of the
parties.

  In the                                                             

  In the                                                              

  In                                                            

Germany

In 2011, Motorola filed
patent infringement actions in Germany against Microsoft and
several Microsoft subsidiaries.

  Motorola asserts two patents (both now expired) are essential        

  Motorola asserts that one patent covers certain syncing              
  functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by Windows Phone   
  7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange         
  Server, and Hotmail Server. In 2013, the court stayed the case       
  pending the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft is    
  seeking to invalidate the patent. In 2013, the Federal Patent Court  
  invalidated the originally issued patent claims, but ruled that      
  certain new amended claims were patentable. Both Motorola and        
  Microsoft appealed. In June 2014, the court reopened infringement    
  proceedings, which are currently stayed.                             
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any  
  injunction by altering its products to avoid Motorola’s      
  infringement claims.                                         
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Any                                                   

In lawsuits Microsoft
filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft asserts that Motorola
Android devices infringe Microsoft patents and is seeking damages
and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in Germany issued
injunctions on three of the Microsoft patents, which Motorola
appealed. One judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and Motorola
has further appealed), and the other two appeals are pending (in
one of these two cases the asserted patent has expired). An
additional infringement proceeding is still pending in the court of
first instance. In actions filed separately by Motorola to
invalidate these patents, the Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014
held the Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft appealed. For the
cases in which Microsoft obtained injunctions, if Motorola were to
prevail following all appeals, Motorola could have a claim against
Microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted
injunction.

IPCom patent
litigation

IPCom GmbH & Co.
(“ IPCom”) is a German company that holds a large
portfolio of mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170
patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular
technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation
against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and
operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom entered into a
standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation against
Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement
discussions.

InterDigital patent
litigation

InterDigital Technology
Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation
(collectively, “ IDT”) filed four patent infringement
cases against Nokia in the ITC and in U. S. District Court for the
District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added to
these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other
defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at
issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications
standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include
three ITC investigations where IDT is seeking an order excluding
importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U. S. and one active case
in U. S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and
damages. The ITC issued a finding of no violation relating to two
of the investigations, which IDT appealed. In February 2015, the
U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed one of the
ITC’s findings; the other has been stayed. In the third ITC
action the administrative law judge (“ ALJ”) issued a
determination finding: (1) infringement; (2) evidence of
“reverse hold-up;” and (3) the public interest
does not preclude issuance of an exclusion order. The ITC is
reviewing the ALJ’s initial determination. The trial in the
Delaware case is scheduled for November 2015.

European copyright
levies

We assumed from Nokia all
potential liability due to Nokia’s alleged failure to pay
“private copying levies” in various European countries
based upon sale of memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate
blank memory.  The levies are based upon a 2001 European Union
(“ EU”) Directive establishing a right for end users to
make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but
also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank
media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders for
private copying.  Various collecting societies in EU countries
initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay
levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also
phones that include blank memory for data storage on the phones,
regardless of actual usage of that memory.  The most
significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria,
due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought
in these countries. Since April 2015, we and other major
manufacturers have been engaged in settlement negotiations with the
German collecting society, with the aim of concluding negotiations
by October 2015.

Other patent and intellectual
property claims

In addition to these
cases, there are approximately 70 other patent infringement cases
pending against Microsoft.

Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and
Overcharge Class Actions

A large number of
antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed
against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf
of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC
operating system and certain other software products between 1999
and 2005.

We obtained dismissals or
reached settlements of all claims made in the U. S. Under the
settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that
entitle them to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of
platform-neutral computer hardware and software. The total value of
vouchers that we may issue varies by state. We will make available
to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not
issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state).
The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the
number of class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. We
estimate the total remaining cost of the settlements is
approximately $200 million, all of which had been accrued as of
June 30, 2015.

Three similar cases
pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not
been settled. In 2010, the court in the British Columbia case
certified it as a class action. After the British Columbia Court of
Appeal dismissed the case, in 2013 the Canadian Supreme Court
reversed the appellate court and reinstated part of the British
Columbia case, which is now scheduled for trial in 2016. The other
two cases are inactive.

Other Antitrust Litigation and
Claims

GO Computer
litigation

In June 2005, GO Computer
Inc. and co-founder Jerry Kaplan filed a complaint in California
state court asserting antitrust claims under the Cartwright Act
related to the business of the former GO Corporation in the early
1990s and its successor in interest, Lucent Corporation in the
early 2000s. All claims prior to June 2001 have been dismissed with
prejudice as barred by the statute of limitations. The case is
moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for September
2015.

China State Administration for
Industry and Commerce investigatio

In July 2014, Microsoft
was informed that China’s State Administration for Industry
and Commerce (“ SAIC”) had begun a formal investigation
relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted
onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai,
Guangzhou, and Chengdu.  SAIC has stated the investigation
relates to compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification
issues related to Windows and Office software.

Product-Related
Litigation

U. S. cell phone
litigation

Nokia, along with other
handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 19
lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia
by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from
cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse
health effects. We have assumed responsibility for these claims as
part of the NDS acquisition and have been substituted for the Nokia
defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and are
consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining 10
cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals
for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims
arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the
U. S. Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission
guidelines (“ FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal
law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated
outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC
Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an
industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing
around emission guidelines.

In September 2013,
defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude
plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis
of flawed scientific methodologies. In March 2014, defendants filed
a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs’ general causation
testimony. In August 2014, the court granted in part
defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general
causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal. In
December 2014, the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to
hear en banc

Canadian cell phone class
action

Nokia, along with other
handset manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in a
2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British
Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular
phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with
brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in June 2014
and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The litigation
is not yet active as several defendants remain to be
served.

Other

We also are subject to a
variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in
the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in
aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial statements, these matters are subject to
inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters
may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2015,
we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $614 million in other
current liabilities and $20 million in other long-term liabilities.
While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse
outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $1.6 billion in
aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were
unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility
of a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial
statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably
estimable.
