In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible 
properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U. S. The transfer of 
intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U. S. tax deductions 
exceeds the current tax liability from the U. S. global intangible low-taxed 
income (“GILTI”) tax.

We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through 
distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the 
India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre 
of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in
86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are 
not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the 
appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to 
withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 
million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the 
India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year 1996 through fiscal year 
2016.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily 
due to the net income tax benefit related to the transfer of intangible 
properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting 
from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign 
regional operations center in Ireland, and tax benefits relating to stock-based 
compensation. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 
is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions 
resulting from producing and distributing our products and services through our 
foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto Rico, tax benefits 
relating to stock-based compensation, and tax benefits from the India Supreme 
Court decision on withholding taxes. The decrease from the federal statutory 
rate in fiscal year 2020 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in 
foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and
services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland and Puerto 
Rico, and tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. In fiscal years 
2022, 2021, and 2020, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland and 
Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, generated 71%, 
82%, and 86% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, net 
consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, 
includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding 
taxes. In fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, there were no individually 
significant other reconciling items.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal 
year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible 
properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income 
taxes between the U. S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the 
prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an 
agreement between the U. S. and India tax authorities related to transfer 
pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations. The decrease in 
our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2021 compared to fiscal year 2020 was 
primarily due to tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on 
withholding taxes, an agreement between the U. S. and India tax authorities 
related to transfer pricing, final TCJA regulations, and an increase in tax 
benefits relating to stock-based compensation.

The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2022, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $318 million, $1.3 billion, and $2.1 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years 
from fiscal 2023 through 2042, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss 
carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation but are expected to be 
realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance. As of 
June 30, 2022, we had $1.3 billion federal capital loss carryforwards for U. S. 
tax purposes from our acquisition of Nuance. The federal capital loss 
carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation and will expire in various 
years from fiscal 2023 through 2025.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net 
deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $16.0 billion, $13.4 billion, and $12.5 
billion in fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 
30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, were $15.6 billion, $14.6 billion, and $13.8 billion, 
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would 
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 by $13.3 
billion, $12.5 billion, and $12.1 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $4.3 billion, $4.3 billion, and $4.0 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for 
fiscal years 2022, 2021, and 2020 included interest expense related to uncertain
tax positions of $36 million, $274 million, and $579 million, respectively, net 
of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax years
2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 
Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 2006 
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion of 
the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of 
the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second 
quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits 
for tax years 2004 to 2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and
interest. We remain under audit for tax years 2004 to 2017.

As of June 30, 2022, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to 
transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated 
financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances 
for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed 
assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues and do not expect a 
final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to 
our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 
1996 to 2021, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. 
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our 
consolidated financial statements.
