Business Combinations for further information.

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed 
as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. 
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts 
allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are 
determined.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations 
and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “Other” in the table above.
Also included in “Other” are business dispositions and transfers between 
segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

Goodwill Impairment

We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, 
primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, 
risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted 
cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the 
businesses.

No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2022, May 1, 2021, or 
May 1, 2020 tests. As of June 30, 2022 and 2021, accumulated goodwill impairment
was $11.3 billion.
