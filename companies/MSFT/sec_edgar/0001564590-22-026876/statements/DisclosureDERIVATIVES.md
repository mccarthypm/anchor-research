We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, 
interest rates, equity prices, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to
facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives 
include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of 
these exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs include 
strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment.

Foreign Currencies

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign 
currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the 
economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions.

Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U. S. dollar-denominated 
investments are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are 
designated as fair value hedging instruments. Foreign currency risks related to 
certain Euro-denominated debt are hedged using foreign exchange forward 
contracts that are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.

Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used
to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet 
amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.

Interest Rate

Interest rate risks related to certain fixed-rate debt are hedged using interest
rate swaps that are designated as fair value hedging instruments to effectively 
convert the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates.

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest 
rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our 
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain 
broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures 
contracts and over-the-counter swap and option contracts. These contracts are 
not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other contracts” in 
the tables below.

Equity

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price 
risk. At times, we may hold options, futures, and swap contracts. These 
contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and are included in “Other 
contracts” in the tables below.

Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of 
investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts to manage 
credit exposures relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio 
diversification. These contracts are not designated as hedging instruments and 
are included in “Other contracts” in the tables below.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain 
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum 
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we 
will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related 
to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2022, our long-term unsecured 
debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a 
result, no collateral was required to be posted.

The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative 
instruments measured in U. S. dollar equivalents:
