In fiscal year 2017, deferred taxes included U. S. and foreign deferred tax 
benefit of $2.7 billion and $617 million, respectively.

U. S. and foreign components of income (loss) before income taxes were as 
follows:

In fiscal year 2017, income before income taxes included the net impact of U. S.
and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of Windows 10 of $6.4 billion
and $317 million, respectively. In fiscal year 2016, income before income taxes 
included the net impact of U. S. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the 
sales of Windows 10 of $6.0 billion and $588 million, respectively. In fiscal 
year 2015, income before income taxes included the net impact of U. S. and 
foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses relating to our 
phone business of $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion, respectively.

The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U. 
S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:

  Year Ended June 30,

The reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to earnings taxed
at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and 
distributing our products and services through our foreign regional operations 
centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign regional operating 
centers, which are taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, generated 64%, 69%,
and 73% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, 
respectively. Additionally, our effective tax rate in fiscal year 2017 reflects 
the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous phone business losses. 
In general, other reconciling items consist primarily of U. S. state income 
taxes, permanent items, and credits. In fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, there
were no individually significant other reconciling items.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2017 compared to fiscal 
year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of tax benefits attributable to 
previous phone business losses, offset in part by changes in the mix of our 
income before income taxes between the U. S. and foreign countries. The fiscal 
year 2016 effective tax rate included the impact of nondeductible phone charges 
and valuation allowances.

The components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as

In fiscal year 2017, we corrected the table above to include a $2.5 billion loss
carryforward and valuation allowance as of June 30, 2016. We do not consider 
this correction to be material, and there was no impact to our consolidated 
financial statements.

As of June 30, 2017, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $13.7 billion, 
including $11.1 billion of foreign net operating loss carryforwards. The 
valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be 
realized.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2017, we have not provided deferred U. S. income taxes or foreign
withholding taxes on temporary differences of approximately $142 billion 
resulting from earnings for certain non-U. S. subsidiaries which are permanently
reinvested outside the U. S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated 
with these temporary differences was approximately $45 billion as of June 30, 
2017.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $2.4 billion, $3.9 billion, and $4.4 
billion in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Tax contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $13.5 billion and $11.8 
billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, and are included in other 
long-term liabilities. This increase relates primarily to current period 
intercompany transfer pricing and tax credits.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, were $11.7 
billion, $10.2 billion, and $9.6 billion, respectively. If recognized, these tax
benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 
2015, by $10.2 billion, $8.8 billion, and $7.9 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2017, 2016, and 2015, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $2.3 billion, $1.9 billion, and $1.7 billion, 
respectively, net of federal income tax benefits. Interest expense on 
unrecognized tax benefits was $399 million, $163 million, and $237 million in 
fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, and was included in provision 
for income taxes.

The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as 
follows:

While we settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“ IRS”) audit for 
tax years 2004 to 2006 during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled
a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter 
of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years. We also continue to 
be subject to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2016. In February 
2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2017, the 
primary unresolved issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a 
significant impact on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved 
favorably. We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. 
We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not 
expect a final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the 
information currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or 
decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 
1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. 
The resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our 
consolidated financial statements.
