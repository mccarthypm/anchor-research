On December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of all issued and outstanding 
shares of LinkedIn Corporation, the world’s largest professional network on the 
Internet, for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. The purchase price 
consisted primarily of cash of $26.9 billion. The acquisition is expected to 
accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, Office 365, and Dynamics 365. The financial 
results of LinkedIn have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
since the date of the acquisition.

2017. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the

Following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of Microsoft 
Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been 
consummated on July 1, 2015:

  (In millions, except earnings per share)                          
  Year Ended June 30,                             2017        2016  
  Revenue                                       91,668      88,652  
  Net income                                    20,894      15,383  
  Diluted earnings per share                      2.67        1.92  

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we 
believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized 
had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not 
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future 
periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase 
accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs and 
other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest 
period presented.
