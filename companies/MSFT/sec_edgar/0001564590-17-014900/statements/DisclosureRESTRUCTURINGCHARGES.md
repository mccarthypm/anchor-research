Phone Hardware Restructuring

In June 2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business to 
better focus and align resources (the “ Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan”), 
under which we eliminated approximately 7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016. In 
fiscal year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under the 
Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses and other 
reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed $21 million of previously
estimated restructuring charges related to contract termination costs. The 
actions associated with the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were completed as 
of June 30, 2017.

2016 Restructuring

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, management approved restructuring 
plans that resulted in approximately 4,700 job eliminations in fiscal year 2017,
primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales.

In fiscal year 2016, we incurred restructuring charges of $501 million in 
connection with the 2016 restructuring plans, including severance expenses and 
other reorganization costs. The actions associated with these restructuring 
plans were completed as of June 30, 2017.

2017 Restructuring

In June 2017, management approved a sales and marketing restructuring plan. In 
fiscal year 2017, we recorded employee severance expenses of $306 million 
primarily related to this sales and marketing restructuring plan. We do not 
expect to incur additional charges for this restructuring plan in subsequent 
years. The actions associated with this restructuring plan are expected to be 
completed by the end of fiscal year 2018.
