| **      SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA** | NOTE 21 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating 
decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain 
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements 
prepared on a basis not consistent with U. S. GAAP. During the periods 
presented, we reported our financial performance based on the following 
segments: Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More 
Personal Computing.

In December 2016, we completed our acquisition of LinkedIn Corporation. LinkedIn
is reported as part of our Productivity and Business Processes segment.

Our reportable segments are described below.

Productivity and Business Processes

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and 
services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information 
services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily 
comprises:

  Office Commercial, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed 
on-premises, comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Skype for Business, and 
Microsoft Teams, and related Client Acces...  

  Office Consumer, including Office 365 subscriptions and Office licensed 
on-premises, and Office Consumer Services, including Skype, Outlook.com, and 
OneDrive.  

  LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, and Premium 
Subscriptions.  

  Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP on-premises, Dynamics CRM 
on-premises, and Dynamics 365, a set of cloud-based applications across ERP and 
CRM.  

Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server
products and cloud services that can power modern business. This segment 
primarily comprises:

  Server products and cloud services, including Microsoft SQL Server, Windows 
Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related CALs, and Azure.  

  Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and Microsoft 
Consulting Services.  

More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared 
towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT professionals
across all devices. This segment primarily comprises:

  Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer licensing and other
non-volume licensing of the Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, 
comprising volume licensing of the Windo...  

  Devices, including Microsoft Surface, PC accessories, and other intelligent 
devices.  

  Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox software and services, comprising 
Xbox Live transactions, subscriptions, and advertising (“ Xbox Live”), video 
games, and third-party video game royalties.  

  Search advertising.  

Corporate and Other includes adjustments to conform our internal accounting 
policies to U. S. GAAP, and impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.
Significant internal accounting policies that differ from U. S. GAAP relate to 
Windows 10 revenue recognition.

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, 
due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and 
costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on certain 
contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the 
underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual 
prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit 
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative 
revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include 
those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple 
segments benefit, and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable 
and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs 
include costs of: legal, including settlements, and fines; information 
technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared 
facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is 
measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs 
being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our 
segments, including impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses.

Segment revenue and operating income (loss) were as follows during the periods 
presented:
