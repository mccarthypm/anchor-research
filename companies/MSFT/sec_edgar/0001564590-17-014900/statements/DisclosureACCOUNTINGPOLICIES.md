Accounting Principles

The consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“ U. S. GAAP”).

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current period 
presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash flows.

Principles of Consolidation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft 
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have 
been eliminated. Equity investments through which we are able to exercise 
significant influence over but do not control the investee and are not the 
primary beneficiary of the investee’s activities are accounted for using the 
equity method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise significant
influence over the investee and which do not have readily determinable fair 
values are accounted for under the cost method.

Estimates and Assumptions

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, 
and expenses. Examples of estimates include: loss contingencies; product 
warranties; the fair value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and 
intangible assets for our reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of 
our tangible and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances
for product returns; the market value of, and demand for, our inventory; and 
stock-based compensation forfeiture rates. Examples of assumptions include: the 
elements comprising a software arrangement, including the distinction between 
upgrades or enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is 
achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax consequences of 
events that have been recognized on our consolidated financial statements or tax
returns; and determining when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. 
Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates and 
assumptions.

Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at 
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments 
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“ OCI”).

Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue

Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity
applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and 
server management tools; software development tools; video games; hardware such 
as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent 
devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of computer 
system integrators and developers.

Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide
customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Microsoft 
Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution 
support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales 
from online advertising and LinkedIn.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, 
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectability is 
probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of allowances for returns and any 
taxes collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental 
authorities.

Revenue recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to 
determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be accounted for as 
separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair value for each of the 
elements.

Microsoft enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of 
software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over different 
periods of time, and when allowed under U. S. GAAP, revenue is allocated to the 
respective elements based on their relative selling prices at the inception of 
the arrangement, and revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use 
a hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating revenue to 
elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value (“ VSOE”), (ii) 
third-party evidence, and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ ESP”). For 
software elements, we follow the industry specific software guidance which only 
allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair value. Generally, VSOE is the 
price charged when the deliverable is sold separately or the price established 
by management for a product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the 
price will not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are 
established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be if the 
deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our process for 
determining ESPs requires judgment and considers multiple factors that may vary 
over time depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each 
deliverable.

Revenue for retail packaged products, products licensed to original equipment 
manufacturers (“ OEMs”), and perpetual licenses under certain volume licensing 
programs generally is recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as multiple-element arrangements
as customers receive free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new
versions of a software product if they license existing versions of the product 
during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the existing product
and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new product is deferred until 
that version is delivered. The revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair 
value of the products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are 
based on the price determined by management having the relevant authority when 
the element is not yet sold separately, but is expected to be sold in the near 
future at the price set by management.

Software updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a 
case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of an upgrade 
and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may require revenue to be 
deferred and recognized when the upgrade is delivered, or if it is determined 
that implied post-contract customer support (“ PCS”) is being provided, the 
arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and all revenue 
from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over the implied PCS term when 
the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If updates are determined to not meet the
definition of an upgrade, revenue is generally recognized as products are 
shipped or made available.

Customers purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates and 
upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no additional cost. As 
these updates and upgrades will not be sold on a stand-alone basis, we are 
unable to establish VSOE of fair value. Accordingly, revenue from licenses of 
Windows 10 is recognized ratably over the estimated life of the related device, 
which ranges between two to four years.

Certain volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current 
products combined with rights to receive unspecified future versions of software
products, which we have determined are additional software products and are 
therefore accounted for as subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned 
revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period. Arrangements
that include term-based licenses for current products with the right to use 
unspecified future versions of the software during the coverage period, are also
accounted for as subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the 
coverage period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow for 
the use of a hosted software product or service over a contractually determined 
period of time without taking possession of software are accounted for as 
subscriptions with billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as 
revenue ratably over the coverage period beginning on the date the service is 
made available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that
are provided on a consumption basis (for example, the amount of storage used in 
a particular period) is recognized commensurate with the customer utilization of
such resources.

Some volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for 
cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for as 
subscriptions. These arrangements are considered multiple-element arrangements. 
However, because all elements are accounted for as subscriptions and have the 
same coverage period and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue 
recognition timing.

Revenue related to Surface devices, Xbox consoles, games published by us, 
phones, and other hardware components is generally recognized when ownership is 
transferred to the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through 
Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of revenue may be 
deferred when these products are combined with software elements, and/or 
services. Revenue related to licensing for games published by third parties for 
use on the Xbox consoles is recognized when games are manufactured by the game 
publishers.

Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. 
Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search 
results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been completed. 
Consulting services revenue is recognized as services are rendered, generally 
based on the negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number
of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services 
arrangements is recognized as services are provided.

Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold
and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service 
centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on 
PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our websites, and to acquire online 
advertising space; costs incurred to support and maintain Internet-based 
products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs;
inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of 
consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software development 
costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the estimated 
lives of the products.

Product Warranty

We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware 
and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For 
hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected 
product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of 
specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and 
conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do 
business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging 
from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to 
provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the 
software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the 
recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.

Research and Development

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, 
stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses 
associated with product development. Research and development expenses also 
include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs 
incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization 
of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software 
development are included in research and development expense until the point 
that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is 
generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once 
technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized 
to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.

Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based 
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales
and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, 
seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 
Advertising expense was $1.5 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.9 billion in fiscal 
years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively.

Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“ 
RSUs”) and performance stock units (“ PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on 
the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based 
on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value
of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the 
fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for 
RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized 
using the accelerated method.

Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ ESPP”) is measured 
as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in 
the period of purchase.

Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes U. S. and international income taxes, the provision 
for U. S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries not 
deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest and penalties on uncertain tax
positions. Certain income and expenses are not reported in tax returns and 
financial statements in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary 
differences is reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are 
reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a tax
benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are classified as 
long-term on our consolidated balance sheets.

Fair Value Measurements

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below
lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in 
measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our 
fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These 
levels are:

  Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical 
instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 non-derivative investments primarily 
include U. S. government securities, domes...  

  Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in 
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets 
that are not active, and model-based valua...  

  Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s
estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The fair values are...  

We measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at 
fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be 
other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these investments are 
determined based on valuation techniques using the best information available, 
and may include quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash 
flow projections. An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the 
investment exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be 
other-than-temporary.

Our other current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have 
fair values that approximate their carrying values.

Financial Instruments

Investments

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of 
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair 
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, 
investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining 
maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. 
Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term 
based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities 
represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations. All 
cash equivalents and short-term investments are classified as available-for-sale
and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific identification 
method. Changes in market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI.

Equity and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and 
equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are classified as
available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are recorded using the specific
identification method. Changes in the market value of available-for-sale 
securities, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. 
Common and preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more 
than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or using the 
equity method.

We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment 
returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the 
loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated 
balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for 
the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying 
security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is 
recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.

Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged
to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available
market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a 
systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available 
quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our 
investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, 
among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt 
instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than
cost, and for equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to 
sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate whether we 
have plans to sell the security or it is more likely than not that we will be 
required to sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific adverse
conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the 
investee, including industry and sector performance, changes in technology, and 
operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is 
determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other
income (expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.

Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are 
measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a 
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting 
designation.

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains (losses) 
are recognized in earnings in the periods of change together with the offsetting
losses (gains) on the hedged items attributed to the risk being hedged. For 
options designated as fair value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded 
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion
of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is initially reported as a component of
OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is 
recognized in earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in 
the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are 
recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing either hedge 
components excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge 
ineffectiveness are recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) 
from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), 
net. Other than those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as 
commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are generally economically offset by 
unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities, which
are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are sold or 
other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are reclassified from
accumulated other comprehensive income (“ AOCI”) into other income (expense), 
net.

Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable 
losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance 
based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, and other currently 
available evidence. Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as 
follows:

  (In millions)

Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or market. 
Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to the 
purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review inventory quantities
on hand, future purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated 
utility of our inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below 
carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to 
cost of revenue.

Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and 
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated 
useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our 
property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or 
acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to 
three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold 
improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. 
Land is not depreciated.

Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment
or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and 
between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more 
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying 
value.

Intangible Assets

All of our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using
the straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from 
one to 15 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets 
periodically by taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant 
revised estimates of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

Recent Accounting Guidance

Accounting for Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Asset Transfers

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) issued new 
guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an 
intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs,
rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. This guidance is 
effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, with early adoption permitted beginning
July 1, 2017. We plan to adopt the guidance effective July 1, 2018. Adoption of 
the guidance will be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a 
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. A 
cumulative-effect adjustment will capture the write-off of income tax 
consequences deferred from past intra-entity transfers involving assets other 
than inventory and new deferred tax assets for amounts not recognized under 
current U. S. GAAP. We anticipate this guidance will have a material impact on 
our consolidated balance sheets upon adoption, and continue to evaluate any 
impacts to our accounting policies, processes, and systems.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss 
impairment methodology under current U. S. GAAP with a methodology that reflects
expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of 
reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will 
be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts 
receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to 
available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance 
for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the 
securities. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2020, with 
early adoption permitted beginning July 1, 2019. Adoption of the standard will 
be applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect 
adjustment to retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently 
evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements,
including accounting policies, processes, and systems.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to increase 
transparency and comparability among organizations by requiring the recognition 
of right-of-use (“ ROU”) assets and lease liabilities on the balance sheet. Most
prominent among the changes in the standard is the recognition of ROU assets and
lease liabilities by lessees for those leases classified as operating leases 
under current U. S. GAAP. Under the standard, disclosures are required to meet 
the objective of enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount, 
timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will be required 
to recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the 
beginning of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified 
retrospective approach, with certain practical expedients available.

The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with early 
adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 
2017 concurrent with our adoption of the new standard related to revenue 
recognition. We elected the available practical expedients on adoption. In 
preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented internal controls 
and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial information.

The standard will have a material impact on our consolidated balance sheets, but
will not have a material impact on our consolidated income statements. The most 
significant impact will be the recognition of ROU assets and lease liabilities 
for operating leases, while our accounting for capital leases remains 
substantially unchanged.

Adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional ROU assets
and lease liabilities for operating leases of $6.6 billion and $5.2 billion as 
of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively. See Expected Impacts to Reported 
Results below for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated 
financial statements.

Financial Instruments - Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure

In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of 
recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes 
in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be 
recognized through net income rather than OCI. The standard will be effective 
for us beginning July 1, 2018. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a 
modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to 
retained earnings as of the effective date. We are currently evaluating the 
impact of this standard on our consolidated financial statements, including 
accounting policies, processes, and systems.

Revenue from Contracts with Customers

In May 2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue recognition. 
Under the standard, revenue is recognized when a customer obtains control of 
promised goods or services in an amount that reflects the consideration the 
entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services. In addition, 
the standard requires disclosure of the nature, amount, timing, and uncertainty 
of revenue and cash flows arising from contracts with customers.

The guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each prior 
reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or retrospectively with 
the cumulative effect of initially applying the guidance recognized at the date 
of initial application (modified retrospective method). We will adopt the 
standard using the full retrospective method to restate each prior reporting 
period presented.

The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, with early 
adoption permitted. We elected to early adopt the standard effective July 1, 
2017. In preparation for adoption of the standard, we have implemented internal 
controls and key system functionality to enable the preparation of financial 
information and have reached conclusions on key accounting assessments related 
to the standard, including our assessment that the impact of accounting for 
costs incurred to obtain a contract is immaterial.

The most significant impact of the standard relates to our accounting for 
software license revenue. Specifically, for Windows 10, we will recognize 
revenue predominantly at the time of billing and delivery rather than ratably 
over the life of the related device. For certain multi-year commercial software 
subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses and Software 
Assurance, we will recognize license revenue at the time of contract execution 
rather than over the subscription period. Due to the complexity of certain of 
our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual revenue recognition 
treatment required under the standard will depend on contract-specific terms and
in some instances may vary from recognition at the time of billing. Revenue 
recognition related to our hardware, cloud offerings such as Office 365, 
LinkedIn, and professional services will remain substantially unchanged.

Adoption of the standard will result in the recognition of additional revenue of
$6.6 billion and $5.8 billion for fiscal year 2017 and 2016, respectively, and 
an increase in the provision for income taxes of $2.5 billion and $2.1 billion, 
respectively, primarily due to the net change in Windows 10 revenue recognition.
In addition, adoption of the standard will result in an increase in accounts 
receivable and other current and long-term assets of $2.7 billion and $4.2 
billion, as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by unbilled 
receivables from upfront recognition of revenue for certain multi-year 
commercial software subscriptions that include both distinct software licenses 
and Software Assurance; a reduction of unearned revenue of $17.8 billion and 
$11.7 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the upfront 
recognition of license revenue from Windows 10 and certain multi-year commercial
software subscriptions; and an increase in deferred income taxes of $5.2 billion
and $4.8 billion as of June 30, 2017 and 2016, respectively, driven by the 
upfront recognition of revenue. See Expected Impacts to Reported Results below 
for the impact of adoption of the standard on our consolidated financial 
statements.

Expected Impacts to Reported Results

Adoption of the standards related to revenue recognition and leases is expected 
to impact our reported results as follows:
