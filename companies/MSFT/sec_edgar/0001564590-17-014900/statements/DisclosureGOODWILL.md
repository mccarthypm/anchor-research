  (a)      Includes goodwill related to LinkedIn and other acquisitions. See 
Note 9 – Business Combinations for further information.  

The measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed end as soon as information on the facts and circumstances that existed 
as of the acquisition dates becomes available, but do not exceed 12 months. 
Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a change in the amounts 
allocated to goodwill during the periods in which the adjustments are 
determined.

Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations 
and purchase accounting adjustments are presented as “ Other” in the above 
table. Also included in “ Other” are business dispositions and transfers between
business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.

Our accumulated goodwill impairment as of both June 30, 2017 and 2016 was $11.3 
billion.

Goodwill Impairment

We test goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level, 
primarily using a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, 
risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted 
cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair values of the 
businesses. Effective May 1, 2017, we prospectively adopted accounting guidance 
that simplifies our goodwill impairment testing by eliminating the requirement 
to calculate the implied fair value of goodwill (formerly “ Step 2”) in the 
event that an impairment is identified. Instead, an impairment charge is 
recorded based on the excess of the reporting unit’s carrying amount over its 
fair value.

No instances of impairment were identified in our May 1, 2017 or May 1, 2016 
test. During fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $5.1 billion 
related to goodwill in our previous Phone Hardware reporting unit. Phone 
Hardware goodwill is included in the Devices reporting unit within More Personal
Computing under our current segment structure.

Upon completion of the annual testing as of May 1, 2015, our previous Phone 
Hardware reporting unit goodwill was determined to be impaired. In the second 
half of fiscal year 2015, Phone Hardware did not meet its sales volume and 
revenue goals, and the mix of units sold had lower margins than planned. These 
results, along with changes in the competitive marketplace and an evaluation of 
business priorities, led to a shift in strategic direction and reduced future 
revenue and profitability expectations for the business. As a result of these 
changes in strategy and expectations, we forecasted reductions in unit volume 
growth rates and lower future cash flows used to estimate the fair value of the 
Phone Hardware reporting unit, which resulted in the determination that an 
impairment adjustment was required.

Because our annual test indicated that Phone Hardware’s carrying value exceeded 
its estimated fair value, Step 2 of the goodwill impairment test was performed 
specific to Phone Hardware. Under Step 2, the fair value of all Phone Hardware 
assets and liabilities were estimated, including tangible assets, existing 
technology, patent agreements, and contractual arrangements, for the purpose of 
deriving an estimate of the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair 
value of the goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine 
the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the value of these 
assets and liabilities included the discount rates and royalty rates used in 
valuing the intangible assets, and consideration of the market environment in 
valuing the tangible assets.
