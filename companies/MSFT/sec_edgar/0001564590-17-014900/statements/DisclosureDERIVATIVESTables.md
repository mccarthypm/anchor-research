| *        Non-designated Hedge Derivatives* | Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not 
designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. 
These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses)
on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income 
(expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than 
those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity 
contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by 
unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and 
gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet 
amounts.
