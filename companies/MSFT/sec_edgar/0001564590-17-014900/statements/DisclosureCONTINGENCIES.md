Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

IPCom patent litigation

IPCom GmbH & Co. (“ IPCom”) is a German company that holds a large portfolio of 
mobile technology-related patents spanning about 170 patent families and 
addressing a broad range of cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of 
these patents in litigation against Nokia Corporation (“ Nokia”) and many of the
leading cell phone companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and 
IPCom entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending litigation 
against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue settlement discussions, which 
continue.

InterDigital patent litigation

InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital Communications Corporation 
(collectively, “ IDT”) filed four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the
International Trade Commission (“ ITC”) and in U. S. District Court for the 
District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We were added to these cases as a 
defendant after we acquired the Nokia phone business. Each of the ITC matters 
was resolved in our favor. In September 2015, in aninter partesreview the United
States Patent Trial and Appeal Board issued a final written decision that deemed
unpatentable all asserted claims of the patent remaining at issue in the 
Delaware case. IDT’s appeal of this decision was heard by the U. S. Court of 
Appeals for the Federal Circuit on April 7, 2017 and the Delaware case was 
stayed pending final completion of theinter partesreview (including appeals and 
any subsequent proceedings in the Patent Office). We filed an antitrust 
complaint against IDT in the District of Delaware in August 2015 asserting 
violations of Section 2 of the Sherman Act, alleging unlawful exploitation of 
standard essential patents. Microsoft and IDT settled these cases in May 2017 
and they have been dismissed.

European copyright levies

We assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s alleged failure to 
pay “private copyright levies” in various European countries based upon sale of 
memory cards and mobile phones that incorporate blank memory. The levies are 
based upon a 2001 European Union (“ EU”) Directive establishing a right for end 
users to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use, but also 
allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording 
devices to compensate copyright holders for private copying. Various collecting 
societies in EU countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating it must 
pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards, but also phones that
include blank memory for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage 
of that memory. The most significant cases against Nokia were pending in Germany
and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought 
in these countries. We reached a settlement of the Austrian case in August 2016.
In Germany, the only period for which settlement has not been reached is 2004 
through 2007. In July 2016, the German Supreme Court heard our appeal contesting
the legality of the levy assessed on phones with music players and over five 
megabytes of memory. The Supreme Court issued a ruling in December 2016, finding
that the levy may not be appropriate for phones that have the ability to receive
music files only via Bluetooth or infrared inputs, and remanded for further 
proceedings. A new case schedule has not been set, and we have reached a 
tentative settlement.

Other patent and intellectual property claims

In addition to the IPCom cases, there were 41 other patent infringement cases 
pending against Microsoft as of June 30, 2017.

Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions

Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in 
British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on 
behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft 
operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 
and 2010.

The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The plaintiffs 
filed their case in chief in August 2016, setting out claims made, authorities, 
and evidence in support of their claims. A six-month oral hearing is scheduled 
to commence in September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness 
affidavits. The Ontario and Quebec cases are inactive.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims

China State Administration for Industry and Commerce investigation

In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for Industry 
and Commerce (“ SAIC”) had begun a formal investigation relating to China’s 
Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft 
offices in Beijing, Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the 
investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues 
related to Windows and Office software, and potentially other issues.

Product-Related Litigation

U. S. cell phone litigation

Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a 
defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of 
Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular 
handsets caused their brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed 
responsibility for these claims as part of our acquisition of Nokia’s Devices 
and Services business and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine 
of these cases were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial 
proceedings; the remaining 10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the
Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect 
claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U. S. 
Federal Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“ FCC 
Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their 
handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before 
the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide 
conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.

In 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude plaintiffs’ 
expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed scientific 
methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in part 
defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general causation experts. The 
defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard for evaluating
expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals 
hearden banc. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision adopting
the standard advocated by defendants and remanding the cases to the trial court 
for further proceedings under that standard. Plaintiffs have filed a motion to 
reopen discovery and file additional expert evidence.

Canadian cell phone class action

Nokia, along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a 
defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court of British 
Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used cellular phones for at 
least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with brain tumors. Microsoft 
was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the 
Nokia defendants. The litigation has been dormant for more than two years.

Other Contingencies

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time 
to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently 
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have a material adverse impact on our consolidated financial statements, 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of 
these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2017, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $352 million. 
While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we 
estimate could reach approximately $1.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded 
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our consolidated 
financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably 
estimable.

Indemnifications

We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers 
against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties 
arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we
have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and 
privacy commitments in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for 
these indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of 
probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable 
estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant 
costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any liabilities 
related to these indemnifications on our consolidated financial statements.
