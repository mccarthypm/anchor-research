We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. As of June 30, 
2017, an aggregate of 127 million shares were authorized for future grant under 
our stock plans. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares 
generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of 
Microsoft common stock to satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock 
plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.

Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as

Stock Plans

Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as 
the award vests. Stock awards generally vest over a four or five-year service 
period.

Executive Incentive Plan

Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock 
awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest 
ratably over a four-year service period. PSUs generally vest over a three-year 
performance period. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the
extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

Activity for all stock plans

The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the 
following assumptions:

Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations.
Participating U. S. employees may contribute a portion of their salary, subject 
to certain limitations. Beginning January 2016, we contribute fifty cents for 
each dollar a participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum employer 
contribution of 50% of the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year. Prior 
to January 2016, we contributed fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a 
participant contributed in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser 
of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the 
calendar year. Matching contributions for all plans were $734 million, $549 
million, and $454 million in fiscal years 2017, 2016, and 2015, respectively, 
and were expensed as contributed.
