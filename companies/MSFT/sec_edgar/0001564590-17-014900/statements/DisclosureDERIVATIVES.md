We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, 
equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to
facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives 
include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of 
these exposures as effectively as possible.

Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify 
for hedge accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are 
measured in U. S. dollar equivalents.

Foreign Currency

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign 
currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the 
economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and 
forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international 
revenue for up to three years in the future and are designated as cash flow 
hedging instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen,
British pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30, 2017 and 
2016, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were 
$8.9 billion and $8.4 billion, respectively.

Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U. S. dollar denominated 
securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are 
designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the 
total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $5.1 
billion and $5.3 billion, respectively.

Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used
to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet 
amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures. As of June 30, 2017, the
total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold 
were $8.8 billion and $10.6 billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the 
total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold 
were $12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively.

Equity

Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to 
market price risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global 
and domestic equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, 
options, futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From
time to time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity 
derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards. 
As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of equity contracts purchased 
and sold for managing market price risk were $1.9 billion and $2.4 billion, 
respectively, of which $1.6 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, were 
designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional 
amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk 
were $1.3 billion and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986
million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments.

Interest Rate

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest 
rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our 
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain 
broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures 
contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are 
designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2017, the total notional 
amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $233 million 
and $352 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts 
of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4 
billion, respectively.

In addition, we use “ To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of 
mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. 
These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical 
delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As 
of June 30, 2017 and 2016, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage 
contracts purchased were $567 million and $548 million, respectively.

Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of 
investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not 
designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to 
broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit 
default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual 
credit risks or groups of credit risks. As of June 30, 2017, the total notional 
amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $267 million and $63 
million, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit
contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million, respectively.

Commodity

We use broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to 
facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option 
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and manage 
exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use derivatives on commodities as
they can be low-cost alternatives to the purchase and storage of a variety of 
commodities, including, but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. 
As of June 30, 2017, the total notional amounts of commodity contracts purchased
were $19 million. As of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity 
contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million, respectively.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain 
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum 
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we 
will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related 
to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2017, our long-term unsecured 
debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a 
result, no collateral was required to be posted.

Fair Values of Derivative Instruments

The following table presents the fair values of derivative instruments 
designated as hedging instruments (“designated hedge derivatives”) and not 
designated as hedging instruments (“non-designated hedge derivatives”). The fair
values exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities when a 
legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value adjustments 
related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit risk:

Cash Flow Hedge Gains (Losses)

designated as cash flow hedges:

We estimate that $130 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI as of 
June 30, 2017 will be reclassified into earnings within the following 12 months.
No significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from AOCI into 
earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to occur during 
fiscal year 2017.

Non-Designated Derivative Gains (Losses)

Gains (losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not 
designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net. 
These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains (losses)
on derivatives presented in income statement line items other than other income 
(expense), net, which were immaterial for the periods presented. Other than 
those derivatives entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity 
contracts, the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by 
unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities and 
gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on certain balance sheet 
amounts.
