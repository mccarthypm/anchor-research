Short-term Debt

As of June 30, 2017, we had $9.1 billion of commercial paper issued and 
outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate of 1.01% and maturities 
ranging from 25 days to 264 days. As of June 30, 2016, we had $12.9 billion of 
commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a weighted-average interest rate 
of 0.43% and maturities ranging from 1 day to 99 days. The estimated fair value 
of this commercial paper approximates its carrying value.

We have two $5.0 billion credit facilities that expire on October 31, 2017 and 
November 14, 2018, respectively. These credit facilities serve as a back-up for 
our commercial paper program. As of June 30, 2017, we were in compliance with 
the only financial covenant in both credit agreements, which requires us to 
maintain a coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, 
taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in the 
credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit facilities during 
any of the periods presented.

Long-term Debt

As of June 30, 2017, the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our 
long-term debt, including the current portion, were $77.1 billion and $80.3 
billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2016, the total carrying value and 
estimated fair value of our long-term debt were $40.6 billion and $44.0 billion,
respectively. These estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

The components of our long-term debt, including the current portion, and the 
associated interest rates were as follows:

  (a)      In August 2016, we issued $19.8 billion of debt securities.  

  (b)      Remaining notes that were acquired as part of the LinkedIn 
acquisition. See Note 9 – Business Combinations for further information.  

  (c)      In February 2017, we issued $17.0 billion of debt securities.  

  (d)      Euro-denominated debt securities.  

  Not applicable.  

The notes in the table above are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally 
with our other senior unsecured debt outstanding. Interest on these notes is 
paid semi-annually, except for the euro-denominated debt securities on which 
interest is paid annually. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal years 
2017, 2016, and 2015 was $1.6 billion, $1.1 billion, and $620 million, 
respectively. Effective July 1, 2016, we retrospectively adopted accounting 
guidance that requires debt issuance costs to be recorded as a deduction from 
the carrying amount of the debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. As of
June 30, 2017 and 2016, the aggregate unamortized discount and debt issuance 
costs associated with our long-term debt, including the current portion, were 
$715 million and $392 million, respectively.

Maturities of our long-term debt for each of the next five years and thereafter 
are as follows:
