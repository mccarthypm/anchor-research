We use derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, 
equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns; and to
facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for holding derivatives 
include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of 
these exposures as effectively as possible.

Our derivative programs include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify 
for hedge accounting treatment.

Foreign Currency

Certain forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign 
currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the 
economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions. Option and 
forward contracts are used to hedge a portion of forecasted international 
revenue and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments. Principal 
currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British pound, Canadian 
dollar, and Australian dollar.

Foreign currency risks related to certain non-U. S. dollar denominated 
securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are 
designated as fair value hedging instruments.

Certain options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used
to manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance sheet 
amounts and to manage other foreign currency exposures.

Equity

Securities held in our equity investments portfolio are subject to market price 
risk. Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based global and domestic 
equity indices using certain convertible preferred investments, options, 
futures, and swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. In the past, 
to hedge our price risk, we also used and designated equity derivatives as 
hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.

Other

Interest Rate

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest 
rate risks based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our 
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate to certain 
broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded option and futures 
contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are 
designated as hedging instruments.

In addition, we use “ To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of 
mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed securities. 
These meet the definition of a derivative instrument in cases where physical 
delivery of the assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date.

Credit

Our fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of 
investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not 
designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to 
broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We use credit 
default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing exposure to individual 
credit risks or groups of credit risks.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent Features

Certain of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain 
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term unsecured debt to 
maintain an investment grade credit rating and require us to maintain minimum 
liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the extent we fail to meet these requirements, we 
will be required to post collateral, similar to the standard convention related 
to over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2019, our long-term unsecured 
debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were in excess of $1.0 billion. As a 
result, no collateral was required to be posted.

The following table presents the notional amounts of our outstanding derivative 
instruments measured in U. S. dollar equivalents:
