  (a)      Refer to Note 5 – Derivatives for further information on the fair 
value of our derivative instruments.  

Equity investments presented as “ Other” in the tables above include investments
without readily determinable fair values measured using the equity method or 
measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or 
impairments, and investments measured at fair value using net asset value as a 
practical expedient which are not categorized in the fair value hierarchy. As of
June 30, 2019 and 2018, equity investments without readily determinable fair 
values measured at cost with adjustments for observable changes in price or 
impairments were $1.2 billion and $697 million, respectively.

As of June 30, 2019, we had no collateral received under agreements for loaned 
securities. As of June 30, 2018, collateral received under agreements for loaned
securities was $1.8 billion and primarily comprised U. S. government and agency 
securities.

Unrealized Losses on Debt Investments

Debt investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 
12 months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:

                                              Less than 12 Months

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to 
changes in interest rates. Management does not believe any remaining unrealized 
losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of 
available evidence.
