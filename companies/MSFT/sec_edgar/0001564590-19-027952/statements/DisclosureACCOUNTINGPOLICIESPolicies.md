| **  Accounting Principles** | Accounting Principles

Our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America (“ GAAP”).

We have recast certain prior period amounts related to investments, derivatives,
and fair value measurements to conform to the current period presentation based 
on our adoption of the new accounting standard for financial instruments. We 
have recast prior period commercial cloud revenue to include the commercial 
portion of LinkedIn to provide a comparable view of our commercial cloud 
business performance. The commercial portion of LinkedIn includes LinkedIn 
Recruiter, Sales Navigator, premium business subscriptions, and other services 
for organizations. We have also recast components of the prior period deferred 
income tax assets and liabilities to conform to the current period presentation.
The recast of these prior period amounts had no impact on our consolidated 
balance sheets, consolidated income statements, or net cash from or used in 
operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft 
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and balances have 
been eliminated.

|   Estimates and Assumptions | Estimates and Assumptions

Preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue, 
and expenses. Examples of estimates and assumptions include: for revenue 
recognition, determining the nature and timing of satisfaction of performance 
obligations, and determining the standalone selling price (“ SSP”) of 
performance obligations, variable consideration, and other obligations such as 
product returns and refunds; loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair 
value of and/or potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets for our 
reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible and 
intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; the market value of, and 
demand for, our inventory; stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; when 
technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the potential outcome of
uncertain tax positions that have been recognized on our consolidated financial 
statements or tax returns; and determining the timing and amount of impairments 
for investments. Actual results and outcomes may differ from management’s 
estimates and assumptions.

| **  Foreign Currencies** | Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the 
exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at 
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments 
resulting from this process are recorded to other comprehensive income (“ OCI”).

Product Revenue and Service and Other Revenue

Product revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device productivity
applications; server applications; business solution applications; desktop and 
server management tools; software development tools; video games; and hardware 
such as PCs, tablets, gaming and entertainment consoles, other intelligent 
devices, and related accessories.

Service and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that provide
customers with software, services, platforms, and content such as Microsoft 
Office 365, Microsoft Azure, Microsoft Dynamics 365, and Xbox Live; solution 
support; and consulting services. Service and other revenue also includes sales 
from online advertising and LinkedIn.

Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized upon transfer of control of promised products or services 
to customers in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to receive 
in exchange for those products or services. We enter into contracts that can 
include various combinations of products and services, which are generally 
capable of being distinct and accounted for as separate performance obligations.
Revenue is recognized net of allowances for returns and any taxes collected from
customers, which are subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Nature of Products and Services

Licenses for on-premises software provide the customer with a right to use the 
software as it exists when made available to the customer. Customers may 
purchase perpetual licenses or subscribe to licenses, which provide customers 
with the same functionality and differ mainly in the duration over which the 
customer benefits from the software. Revenue from distinct on-premises licenses 
is recognized upfront at the point in time when the software is made available 
to the customer. In cases where we allocate revenue to software updates, 
primarily because the updates are provided at no additional charge, revenue is 
recognized as the updates are provided, which is generally ratably over the 
estimated life of the related device or license.

Certain volume licensing programs, including Enterprise Agreements, include 
on-premises licenses combined with Software Assurance (“ SA”). SA conveys rights
to new software and upgrades released over the contract period and provides 
support, tools, and training to help customers deploy and use products more 
efficiently. On-premises licenses are considered distinct performance 
obligations when sold with SA. Revenue allocated to SA is generally recognized 
ratably over the contract period as customers simultaneously consume and receive
benefits, given that SA comprises distinct performance obligations that are 
satisfied over time.

Cloud services, which allow customers to use hosted software over the contract 
period without taking possession of the software, are provided on either a 
subscription or consumption basis. Revenue related to cloud services provided on
a subscription basis is recognized ratably over the contract period. Revenue 
related to cloud services provided on a consumption basis, such as the amount of
storage used in a period, is recognized based on the customer utilization of 
such resources. When cloud services require a significant level of integration 
and interdependency with software and the individual components are not 
considered distinct, all revenue is recognized over the period in which the 
cloud services are provided.

Revenue from search advertising is recognized when the advertisement appears in 
the search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been 
completed. Revenue from consulting services is recognized as services are 
provided.

Our hardware isgenerally highly dependent on, and interrelated with, the 
underlying operating system and cannot function without the operating system. In
these cases, the hardware and software license are accounted for as a single 
performance obligation and revenue is recognized at the point in time when 
ownership is transferred to resellers or directly to end customers through 
retail stores and online marketplaces.

Refer to Note 20 - Segment Information and Geographic Data for further 
information, including revenue by significant product and service offering.

Significant Judgments

Our contracts with customers often include promises to transfer multiple 
products and services to a customer. Determining whether products and services 
are considered distinct performance obligations that should be accounted for 
separately versus together may require significant judgment. When a cloud-based 
service includes both on-premises software licenses and cloud services, judgment
is required to determine whether the software license is considered distinct and
accounted for separately, or not distinct and accounted for together with the 
cloud service and recognized over time. Certain cloud services, primarily Office
365, depend on a significant level of integration, interdependency, and 
interrelation between the desktop applications and cloud services, and are 
accounted for together as one performance obligation. Revenue from Office 365 is
recognized ratably over the period in which the cloud services are provided.

Judgment is required to determine the SSP for each distinct performance 
obligation. We use a single amount to estimate SSP for items that are not sold 
separately, including on-premises licenses sold with SA or software updates 
provided at no additional charge. We use a range of amounts to estimate SSP when
we sell each of the products and services separately and need to determine 
whether there is a discount to be allocated based on the relative SSP of the 
various products and services.

In instances where SSP is not directly observable, such as when we do not sell 
the product or service separately, we determine the SSP using information that 
may include market conditions and other observable inputs. We typically have 
more than one SSP for individual products and services due to the stratification
of those products and services by customers and circumstances. In these 
instances, we may use information such as the size of the customer and 
geographic region in determining the SSP.

Due to the various benefits from and the nature of our SA program, judgment is 
required to assess the pattern of delivery, including the exercise pattern of 
certain benefits across our portfolio of customers.

Our products are generally sold with a right of return, we may provide other 
credits or incentives, and in certain instances we estimate customer usage of 
our products and services, which are accounted for as variable consideration 
when determining the amount of revenue to recognize. Returns and credits are 
estimated at contract inception and updated at the end of each reporting period 
if additional information becomes available. Changes to our estimated variable 
consideration were not material for the periods presented.

Contract Balances

Timing of revenue recognition may differ from the timing of invoicing to 
customers. We record a receivable when revenue is recognized prior to invoicing,
or unearned revenue when revenue is recognized subsequent to invoicing. For 
multi-year agreements, we generally invoice customers annually at the beginning 
of each annual coverage period. We record a receivable related to revenue 
recognized for multi-year on-premises licenses as we have an unconditional right
to invoice and receive payment in the future related to those licenses.

As of June 30, 2019 and 2018, long-term accounts receivable, net of allowance 
for doubtful accounts, was $2.2 billion and $1.8 billion, respectively, and is 
included in other long-term assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

The allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable 
losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the allowance 
based on known troubled accounts, historical experience, andother currently 
available evidence.

Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as follows:

Unearned revenue comprises mainly unearned revenue related to volume licensing 
programs, which may include SA and cloud services. Unearned revenue is generally
invoiced annually at the beginning of each contract period for multi-year 
agreements and recognized ratably over the coverage period. Unearned revenue 
also includes payments for consulting services to be performed in the future; 
LinkedIn subscriptions; Office 365 subscriptions; Xbox Live subscriptions; 
Windows 10 post-delivery support; Dynamics business solutions; Skype prepaid 
credits and subscriptions; and other offerings for which we have been paid in 
advance and earn the revenue when we transfer control of the product or service.

Refer to Note 14 - Unearned Revenue for further information, including unearned 
revenue by segment and changes in unearned revenue during the period.

Payment terms and conditions vary by contract type, although terms generally 
include a requirement of payment within 30 to 60 days. In instances where the 
timing of revenue recognition differs from the timing of invoicing, we have 
determined our contracts generally do not include a significant financing 
component. The primary purpose of our invoicing terms is to provide customers 
with simplified and predictable ways of purchasing our products and services, 
not to receive financing from our customers or to provide customers with 
financing. Examples include invoicing at the beginning of a subscription term 
with revenue recognized ratably over the contract period, and multi-year 
on-premises licenses that are invoiced annually with revenue recognized upfront.

Assets Recognized from Costs to Obtain a Contract with a Customer

We recognize an asset for the incremental costs of obtaining a contract with a 
customer if we expect the benefit of those costs to be longer than one year. We 
have determined that certain sales incentive programs meet the requirements to 
be capitalized. Total capitalized costs to obtain a contract were immaterial 
during the periods presented and are included in other current and long-term 
assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

We apply a practical expedient to expense costs as incurred for costs to obtain 
a contract with a customer when the amortization period would have been one year
or less. These costs include our internal sales force compensation program and 
certain partner sales incentive programs as we have determined annual 
compensation is commensurate with annual sales activities.
 |  |  |
| **  Cost of Revenue** | Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold
and programs licensed; operating costs related to product support service 
centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include software on 
PCs sold by original equipment manufacturers (“ OEM”), to drive traffic to our 
websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs incurred to support and
maintain online products and services, including datacenter costs and royalties;
warranty costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the 
delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized software 
development costs. Capitalized software development costs are amortized over the
estimated lives of the products.
 |  |  |
|   Product Warranty | Product Warranty

We provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware 
and software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. For 
hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical and projected 
product failure rates, historical and projected repair costs, and knowledge of 
specific product failures (if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and 
conditions vary depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do 
business, but generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging 
from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we estimate the costs to 
provide bug fixes, such as security patches, over the estimated life of the 
software. We regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the 
recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
 |  |  |
| **  Research and Development** | Research and Development

Research and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits, 
stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses 
associated with product development. Research and development expenses also 
include third-party development and programming costs, localization costs 
incurred to translate software for international markets, and the amortization 
of purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to software 
development are included in research and development expense until the point 
that technological feasibility is reached, which for our software products, is 
generally shortly before the products are released to production. Once 
technological feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized 
to cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
 |  |  |
| **  Sales and Marketing** | Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based 
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses associated with sales
and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising, promotions, trade shows, 
seminars, and other programs. Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. 
Advertising expense was $1.6 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.5 billion in fiscal 
years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.
 |  |  |
|   Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-Based Compensation

Compensation cost for stock awards, which include restricted stock units (“ 
RSUs”) and performance stock units (“ PSUs”), is measured at the fair value on 
the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated forfeitures, over the
related service or performance period. The fair value of stock awards is based 
on the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the present value
of expected dividends not received during the vesting period. We measure the 
fair value of PSUs using a Monte Carlo valuation model. Compensation cost for 
RSUs is recognized using the straight-line method and for PSUs is recognized 
using the accelerated method.

Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan (“ ESPP”) is measured 
as the discount the employee is entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in 
the period of purchase.
 |  |  |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income tax expense includes U. S. and international income taxes, and interest 
and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not 
reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year. The tax 
effect of such temporary differences is reported as deferred income taxes. 
Deferred tax assets are reported net of a valuation allowance when it is more 
likely than not that a tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income 
taxes are classified as long-term in our consolidated balance sheets.

Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, theTax Cuts and Jobs Act(“ TCJA”) was enacted into law, 
which significantly changed existing U. S. tax law and included numerous 
provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax 
on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U. S. federal 
statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. In fiscal year 2018, 
the TCJA required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not 
previously subject to U. S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and 
certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA 
reduced the U. S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 
1, 2018. In addition, the TCJA subjected us to a tax on our GILTI effective July
1, 2018.

Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due 
on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into 
our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which 
we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our 
consolidated balance sheets.

During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to 
the enactment of the TCJA, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on 
the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in 
part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. During the second quarter of fiscal year 
2019, we recorded additional tax expense of $157 million, which related to 
completing our provisional accounting for GILTI deferred taxes pursuant to 
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently 
issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our 
foreign subsidiaries to the U. S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible 
properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions 
exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U. S. GILTI 
tax.
 |  |  |
| **  Investments** | Investments

We consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of 
three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair 
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In general, 
investments with original maturities of greater than three months and remaining 
maturities of less than one year are classified as short-term investments. 
Investments with maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term 
based on their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities 
represent the investment of cash that is available for current operations.

Debt investments are classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and 
losses are recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in fair 
value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are recorded in OCI. Debt 
investments are impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be 
other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly available 
market information or other estimates determined by management. We employ a 
systematic methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available 
quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our 
investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, 
among other factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt 
instrument issuers, and the duration and extent to which the fair value is less 
than cost. We also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the security or it is 
more likely than not that we will be required to sell the security before 
recovery. In addition, we consider specific adverse conditions related to the 
financial health of and business outlook for the investee, including industry 
and sector performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing 
cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be 
other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded in other income 
(expense), net and a new cost basis in the investment is established.

Equity investments with readily determinable fair values are measured at fair 
value. Equity investments without readily determinable fair values are measured 
using the equity method, or measured at cost with adjustments for observable 
changes in price or impairments (referred to as the measurement alternative). We
perform a qualitative assessment on a quarterly basis and recognize an 
impairment if there are sufficient indicators that the fair value of the 
investment is less than carrying value. Changes in value are recorded in other 
income (expense), net.

We lend certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment 
returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings and the 
loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our consolidated 
balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are received as collateral for 
the loaned securities with the amount determined based upon the underlying 
security lent and the creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is 
recorded as an asset with a corresponding liability.
 |  |  |
| **  Derivatives** | Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or liabilities and 
measured at fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a 
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the resulting 
designation.

For derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, gains and losses are
recognized in other income (expense), net with offsetting gains and losses on 
the hedged items.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion
of the gains and losses are initially reported as a component of OCI and 
subsequently recognized in revenue when the hedged exposure is recognized in 
revenue. Gains and losses on derivatives representing either hedge components 
excluded from the assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are 
recognized in other income (expense), net.

For derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains and losses 
from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income (expense), 
net.
 |  |  |
|   Fair Value Measurements | Fair Value Measurements

We account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below
lists three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used in 
measuring fair value are observable in the market. We categorize each of our 
fair value measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level 
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its entirety. These 
levels are:

  Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted prices for identical 
instruments in active markets. Our Level 1 investments include U. S. government 
securities, common and preferred stock, an...  

  Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in 
active markets, quoted prices for identical or similar instruments in markets 
that are not active, and model-based valua...  

  Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and typically reflect management’s
estimates of assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability. The fair values are...  

We measure equity investments without readily determinable fair values on a 
nonrecurring basis. The fair values of these investments are determined based on
valuation techniques using the best information available, and may include 
quoted market prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.

Our other current financial assets and current financial liabilities have fair 
values that approximate their carrying values.
 |  |  |
| **  Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of cost or net 
realizable value. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead 
related to the purchase and production of inventories. Net realizable value is 
the estimated selling price less estimated costs of completion, disposal, and 
transportation. We regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future 
purchase commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our 
inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, 
we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost of revenue.
 |  |  |
| **  Property and Equipment** | Property and Equipment

Property and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and 
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the estimated 
useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated useful lives of our 
property and equipment are generally as follows: computer software developed or 
acquired for internal use, three to seven years; computer equipment, two to 
three years; buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold 
improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one to 10 years. 
Land is not depreciated.
 |  |  |
| **  Leases** | Leases

We determine if an arrangement is a lease at inception. Operating leases are 
included in operating lease right-of-use (“ ROU”) assets, other current 
liabilities, and operating lease liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.
Finance leases are included in property and equipment, other current 
liabilities, and other long-term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheets.

ROU assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and
lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from 
the lease. Operating lease ROU assets and liabilities are recognized at 
commencement date based on the present value of lease payments over the lease 
term. As most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate, we generally use 
our incremental borrowing rate based on the estimated rate of interest for 
collateralized borrowing over a similar term of the lease payments at 
commencement date. The operating lease ROU asset also includes any lease 
payments made and excludes lease incentives. Our lease terms may include options
to extend or terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will 
exercise that option. Lease expense for lease payments is recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the lease term.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, which are 
generally accounted for separately. For certain equipment leases, such as 
vehicles, we account for the lease and non-lease components as a single lease 
component. Additionally, for certain equipment leases, we apply a portfolio 
approach to effectively account for the operating lease ROU assets and 
liabilities.
 |  |  |
|   Goodwill | Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment
or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us) and 
between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more 
likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying 
value.
 |  |  |
|   Intangible Assets | Intangible Assets

Our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the 
straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit, ranging from one to
20 years. We evaluate the recoverability of intangible assets periodically by 
taking into account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates 
of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be impaired.

Recently Adopted Accounting Guidance

Income Taxes - Intra-Entity Asset Transfers

In October 2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) issued new 
guidance requiring an entity to recognize the income tax consequences of an 
intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory when the transfer occurs,
rather than when the asset has been sold to an outside party. We adopted the 
guidance effective July 1, 2018. Adoption of the guidance was applied using a 
modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to 
retained earnings as of the effective date. We recorded a net cumulative-effect 
adjustment that resulted in an increase in retained earnings of $557 million, 
which reversed the previous deferral of income tax consequences and recorded new
deferred tax assets from intra-entity transfers involving assets other than 
inventory, partially offset by a U. S. deferred tax liability related to global 
intangible low-taxed income (“ GILTI”). Adoption of the standard resulted in an 
increase in long-term deferred tax assets of $2.8 billion, an increase in 
long-term deferred tax liabilities of $2.1 billion, and a reduction in other 
current assets of $152 million. Adoption of the standard had no impact on cash 
from or used in operating, financing, or investing on our consolidated cash 
flows statements.

Financial Instruments - Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and Disclosure

In January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to certain aspects of 
recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure of financial instruments.
Most prominent among the changes in the standard is the requirement for changes 
in the fair value of our equity investments, with certain exceptions, to be 
recognized through net income rather than OCI.

We adopted the standard effective July 1, 2018. Adoption of the standard was 
applied using a modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect 
adjustment from accumulated other comprehensive income (“ AOCI”) to retained 
earnings as of the effective date, and we elected to measure equity investments 
without readily determinable fair values at cost with adjustments for observable
changes in price or impairments. The cumulative-effect adjustment included any 
previously held unrealized gains and losses held in AOCI related to our equity 
investments carried at fair value as well as the impact of recording the fair 
value of certain equity investments carried at cost. The impact on our 
consolidated balance sheets upon adoption was not material. Adoption of the 
standard had no impact on cash from or used in operating, financing, or 
investing on our consolidated cash flows statements.

Recent Accounting Guidance Not Yet Adopted

Financial Instruments - Targeted Improvements to Accounting for Hedging 
Activities

In August 2017, the FASB issued new guidance related to accounting for hedging 
activities. This guidance expands strategies that qualify for hedge accounting, 
changes how many hedging relationships are presented in the financial 
statements, and simplifies the application of hedge accounting in certain 
situations. The standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with 
early adoption permitted for any interim or annual period before the effective 
date. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a modified retrospective 
approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the 
effective date. We evaluated the impact of this standard on our consolidated 
financial statements, including accounting policies, processes, and systems, and
do not expect the impact to be material upon adoption.

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

In June 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss 
impairment methodology under current GAAP with a methodology that reflects 
expected credit losses and requires consideration of a broader range of 
reasonable and supportable information to inform credit loss estimates. We will 
be required to use a forward-looking expected credit loss model for accounts 
receivables, loans, and other financial instruments. Credit losses relating to 
available-for-sale debt securities will also be recorded through an allowance 
for credit losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of the 
securities. The standard will be adopted upon the effective date for us 
beginning July 1, 2020. Adoption of the standard will be applied using a 
modified retrospective approach through a cumulative-effect adjustment to 
retained earnings as of the effective date to align our credit loss methodology 
with the new standard. We are currently evaluating the impact of this standard 
on our consolidated financial statements, including accounting policies, 
processes, and systems.

| **  Earnings Per Share** | Basic earnings per share (“ EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average 
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is 
computed based on the weighted average number of shares of common stock plus the
effect of dilutive potential common shares outstanding during the period using 
the treasury stock method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding 
stock options and stock awards.

| **  Segment Reporting** | Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, 
due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and 
costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain 
contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the 
underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual 
prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit 
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative 
revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include 
those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple 
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable 
and that benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs 
include costs of: legal, including settlements and fines; information 
technology; human resources; finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared 
facilities services; and customer service and support. Each allocation is 
measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs 
being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not allocated to our 
segments, including restructuring expenses.

Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A 
portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in
an overhead allocation to each segment; it is impracticable for us to separately
identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included
in the measure of segment profit or loss.
