Revenue allocated to remaining performance obligations represents contracted 
revenue that has not yet been recognized (“contracted not recognized revenue”), 
which includes unearned revenue and amounts that will be invoiced and recognized
as revenue in future periods. Contracted not recognized revenue was $91 billion 
as of June 30, 2019, of which we expect to recognize approximately 50% of the 
revenue over the next 12 months and the remainder thereafter. Many customers are
committing to our products and services for longer contract terms, which is 
increasing the percentage of contracted revenue that will be recognized beyond 
the next 12 months.
