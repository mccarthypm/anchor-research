We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. As of June 30, 
2019, an aggregate of 327 million shares were authorized for future grant under 
our stock plans. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares 
generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of 
Microsoft common stock to satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock 
plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.

Stock Plans

Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as 
the award vests. Stock awards generally vest over a four or five-year service 
period.

Executive Incentive Plan

Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock 
awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest 
ratably over a four-year service period. PSUs generally vest over a three-year 
performance period. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the
extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

Activity for All Stock Plans

The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the 
following assumptions:
