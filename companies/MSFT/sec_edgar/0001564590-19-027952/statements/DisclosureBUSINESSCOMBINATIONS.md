GitHub, Inc.

On October 25, 2018, we acquired GitHub, Inc. (“ GitHub”), a software 
development platform, in a $7.5 billion stock transaction (inclusive of total 
cash payments of $1.3 billion in respect of vested GitHub equity awards and an 
indemnity escrow). The acquisition is expected to empower developers to achieve 
more at every stage of the development lifecycle, accelerate enterprise use of 
GitHub, and bring Microsoft’s developer tools and services to new audiences. The
financial results of GitHub have been included in our consolidated financial 
statements since the date of the acquisition. GitHub is reported as part of our 
Intelligent Cloud segment.

The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of June 30, 
2019. The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the 
purchase price were as follows:

attributable to anticipated synergies from future growth and is not expected to 
be deductible for tax purposes. We assigned the goodwill to our Intelligent 
Cloud segment.

believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized 
had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not 
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future 
periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase 
accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs and 
other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest 
period presented.

Other

During fiscal year 2019, we completed 19 additional acquisitions for $1.6 
billion, substantially all of which were paid in cash. These entities have been 
included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective 
acquisition dates.
