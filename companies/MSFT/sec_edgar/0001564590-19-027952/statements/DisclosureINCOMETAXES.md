Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, theTax Cuts and Jobs Act(“ TCJA”) was enacted into law, 
which significantly changed existing U. S. tax law and included numerous 
provisions that affect our business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax 
on deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income, reducing the U. S. federal 
statutory tax rate, and adopting a territorial tax system. In fiscal year 2018, 
the TCJA required us to incur a transition tax on deferred foreign income not 
previously subject to U. S. income tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and 
certain other net current assets, and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA 
reduced the U. S. federal statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 
1, 2018. In addition, the TCJA subjected us to a tax on our GILTI effective July
1, 2018.

Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due 
on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into 
our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which 
we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our 
consolidated balance sheets.

During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a net charge of $13.7 billion related to 
the enactment of the TCJA, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on 
the deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in 
part by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on 
deferred tax assets and liabilities. During the second quarter of fiscal year 
2019, we recorded additional tax expense of $157 million, which related to 
completing our provisional accounting for GILTI deferred taxes pursuant to 
Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.

In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, in response to the TCJA and recently 
issued regulations, we transferred certain intangible properties held by our 
foreign subsidiaries to the U. S. and Ireland. The transfers of intangible 
properties resulted in a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit recorded in the 
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019, as the value of future tax deductions 
exceeded the current tax liability from foreign jurisdictions and U. S. GILTI 
tax.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2019 is primarily 
due to a $2.6 billion net income tax benefit related to intangible property 
transfers, and earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting 
from producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign 
regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. The increase
from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily due to the net 
charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year
2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. 
The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 is primarily 
due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions. Our foreign 
regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore and Puerto Rico, which are 
taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, generated 82%, 87%, and 76% of our 
foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively. 
Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax credits, GILTI, and U. S.
state income taxes. In fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, there were no 
individually significant other reconciling items.

The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2019 compared to fiscal 
year 2018 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the 
TCJA in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, and a $2.6 billion net income 
tax benefit in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2019 related to intangible 
property transfers. The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 
compared to fiscal year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the 
enactment of the TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to 
previous Phone business losses in fiscal year 2017.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2019, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $978 million, $770 million, and $11.6 billion, respectively. 
The federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various 
years from fiscal 2020 through 2039, if not utilized. The majority of our 
foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net 
operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are 
expected to be realized with the exception of those which have a valuation 
allowance.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be 
realized.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $8.4 billion, $5.5 billion, and $2.4 
billion in fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 
30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, were $13.1 billion, $12.0 billion, and $11.7 billion, 
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would 
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 by $12.0 
billion, $11.3 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $3.4 billion, $3.0 billion, and $2.3 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for (benefit from) 
income taxes for fiscal years 2019, 2018, and 2017 included interest expense 
related to uncertain tax positions of $515 million, $688 million, and $399 
million, respectively, net of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“ IRS”) audit for tax 
years 2004 to 2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 
2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion 
of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion 
of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013 in fiscal year 2018. We remain under
audit for tax years 2004 to 2013. We expect the IRS to begin an examination of 
tax years 2014 to 2017 within the next 12 months.

As of June 30, 2019, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to 
transfer pricing, which could have a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances 
for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed 
assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of 
these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information currently 
available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax 
contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 
1996 to 2018, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. 
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our 
consolidated financial statements.
