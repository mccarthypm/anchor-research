Patent and
Intellectual Property Claims

IPCom patent
litigation

IPCom
GmbH & Co. (“ IPCom”) is a German company that
holds a large portfolio of mobile technology-related patents
spanning about 170 patent families and addressing a broad range of
cellular technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in
litigation against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone
companies and operators. In November 2014, Microsoft and IPCom
entered into a standstill agreement staying all of the pending
litigation against Microsoft to permit the parties to pursue
settlement discussions.

InterDigital patent
litigation

InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital
Communications Corporation (collectively, “ IDT”) filed
four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the International
Trade Commission (“ ITC”) and in U. S. District Court for
the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013. We have been added
to these cases as a defendant. IDT has cases pending against other
defendants based on the same patents because most of the patents at
issue allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications
standards essential functionality. The cases involving us include
three ITC investigations where IDT sought an order excluding
importation of 3G and 4G phones into the U. S. and one active case
in U. S. District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and
damages. Each of the ITC matters has been resolved in our favor. In
September 2015, in an  inter
partes inter

European copyright
levies

We
assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s
alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in
various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and
mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.  The levies are
based upon a 2001 European Union (“ EU”) Directive
establishing a right for end users to make copies of copyrighted
works for personal or private use, but also allowing the collection
of levies based upon sales of blank media or recording devices to
compensate copyright holders for private copying.  Various
collecting societies in EU countries initiated litigation against
Nokia, stating that Nokia must pay levies not only based upon sales
of blank memory cards, but also phones that include blank memory
for data storage on the phones, regardless of actual usage of that
memory.  The most significant cases against Nokia are pending
in Germany and Austria, due to both the high volume of sales and
high levy amounts sought in these countries. In December 2015, the
industry group BITKOM, of which we are a member, reached a
settlement with the German collecting society for all claims from
2008 forward, leaving litigation only for the period 2004-2007
pending in Germany. In addition, the industry is engaged in
settlement negotiations with the Austrian collecting society. We
have also settled copyright levies litigation in Spain and
France.

Other patent and
intellectual property claims

In
addition to these cases, there were 54 other patent infringement
cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30,
2016.

Antitrust, Unfair
Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions

Antitrust
and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us
in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have
been certified on behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who
acquired licenses for Microsoft operating system software and/or
productivity application software between 1998 and 2010.

The trial
of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. The
plaintiffs are expected to file their case in chief in August 2016,
setting out claims made, authorities, and evidence in
support.  A six-month oral hearing is scheduled to commence in
September 2017, consisting of cross examination on witness
affidavits. The Ontario and Quebec cases are inactive.

Other Antitrust
Litigation and Claims

China State
Administration for Industry and Commerce
investigatio

In 2014,
Microsoft was informed that China’s State Administration for
Industry and Commerce (“ SAIC”) had begun a formal
investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the
SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu.  SAIC has stated the
investigation relates to compatibility, bundle sales, file
verification issues related to Windows and Office software, and
potentially other issues.

Product-Related
Litigation

U. S. cell phone
litigation

Nokia,
along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the
District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio
emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and
other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these
claims as part of the NDS acquisition and have been substituted for
the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and
are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining
10 cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of
Appeals for the District of Columbia held that adverse health
effect claims arising from the use of cellular handsets that
operate within the U. S. Federal Communications Commission radio
frequency emission guidelines (“ FCC Guidelines”) are
pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their
handsets either operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were
manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The
lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the
science and testing around emission guidelines.

In 2013,
defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude
plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis
of flawed scientific methodologies. In 2014, the court granted in
part defendants’ motion to exclude plaintiffs’ general
causation experts. The plaintiffs filed an interlocutory appeal
challenging the standard for evaluating expert scientific evidence,
which the District of Columbia Court of Appeals agreed to
hear  en
banc

Canadian cell phone
class action

Nokia,
along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court
of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used
cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of
users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in
June 2014 and has been substituted for the Nokia defendants. The
litigation is not yet active as several defendants remain to be
served.

Other

We also
are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from
time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although
management currently believes that resolving claims against us,
individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are
subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of
these matters may change in the future.

As of
June 30, 2016, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $521
million in other current liabilities. While we intend to defend
these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could
reach approximately $1.6 billion in aggregate beyond recorded
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to
occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on
our consolidated financial statements for the period in which the
effects become reasonably estimable.

Indemnifications

We
provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain
customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made
by third parties arising from the use of our products and certain
other matters. Additionally, we have agreed to cover damages
resulting from breaches of certain security and privacy commitments
in our cloud business. We evaluate estimated losses for these
indemnifications, and we consider such factors as the degree of
probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a
reasonable estimate of the amount of loss. To date, we have not
encountered significant costs as a result of these obligations and
have not accrued any liabilities related to these indemnifications
on our consolidated financial statements.
