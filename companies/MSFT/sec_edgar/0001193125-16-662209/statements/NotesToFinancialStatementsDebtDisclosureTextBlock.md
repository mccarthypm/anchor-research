DEBT

Short-term Debt

As of June 30, 2016,
we had $12.9 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding,
with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.43% and maturities
ranging from 1 day to 99 days. As of June 30, 2015, we had
$5.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding, with a
weighted-average interest rate of 0.11% and maturities ranging from
8 days to 63 days. The estimated fair value of this commercial
paper approximates its carrying value.

We have two $5.0 billion
credit facilities that expire on November 1, 2016 and
November 14, 2018, respectively. These credit facilities serve
as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of June 30,
2016, we were in compliance with the only financial covenant in
both credit agreements, which requires us to maintain a coverage
ratio of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as defined in
the credit agreements. No amounts were drawn against these credit
facilities during any of the periods presented.

Long-term Debt

As of June 30, 2016,
the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term
debt were $40.8 billion and $44.0 billion, respectively. This is
compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our
long-term debt, including the current portion, of $30.3 billion and
$30.5 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2015. These
estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

The components of our
long-term debt, including the current portion, and the associated
interest rates were as follows as of June 30, 2016 and
2015:
