 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its
operation of the business, management, including our chief
operating decision maker, reviews certain financial information,
including segmented internal profit and loss statements prepared on
a basis not consistent with U. S. GAAP.

In June
2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to
our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating
decision maker requested changes in the information that he
regularly reviews for purposes of allocating resources and
assessing performance. As a result, beginning in fiscal year 2016,
we report our financial performance based on our new segments,
Productivity and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More
Personal Computing, and analyze operating income as the measure of
segment profitability. We have recast certain prior period amounts
to conform to the way we internally manage and monitor segment
performance.

Our
reportable segments are described below.

Productivity and
Business Processes

Our
Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products
and services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and
information services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms.
This segment primarily comprises:

  Office                                                              

  Office                                                               

  Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics ERP products,  

Intelligent
Cloud

Our
Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and
hybrid server products and cloud services that can power modern
business. This segment primarily comprises:

  Server                                                              

  Enterprise Services, including Premier Support Services and  

More Personal
Computing

Our More
Personal Computing segment consists of products and services geared
towards harmonizing the interests of end users, developers, and IT
professionals across screens of all sizes. This segment primarily
comprises:

  Windows, including Windows original equipment manufacturer          

  Devices, including Surface, phones, and PC  

  Gaming, including Xbox hardware; Xbox Live, comprising          

  Search        

Revenue
and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments.
However, due to the integrated structure of our business, certain
revenue recognized and costs incurred by one segment may benefit
other segments. Revenue on certain contracts is allocated among the
segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and
services, which can include allocation based on actual prices
charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a
profit margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based
on a relative revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are
allocated primarily include those relating to marketing of products
and services from which multiple segments benefit, and are
generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In
addition, certain costs incurred at a corporate level that are
identifiable and that benefit our segments are allocated to them.
These allocated costs include costs of: legal, including
settlements, and fines; information technology; human resources;
finance; excise taxes; field selling; shared facilities services;
and customer service and support. Each allocation is measured
differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the
costs being allocated. Certain corporate-level activity is not
allocated to our segments, including impairment, integration, and
restructuring expenses.

Segment
revenue and operating income (loss) were as follows during the
periods presented:
