 - ACCOUNTING POLICIES

Accounting
Principles

The
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes are
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally
accepted in the United States of America (“ U. S.
GAAP”).

We have
recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the current
period presentation, with no impact on consolidated net income or
cash flows.

Principles of
Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Microsoft
Corporation and its subsidiaries. Intercompany transactions and
balances have been eliminated. Equity investments through which we
are able to exercise significant influence over but do not control
the investee and are not the primary beneficiary of the
investee’s activities are accounted for using the equity
method. Investments through which we are not able to exercise
significant influence over the investee and which do not have
readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the cost
method.

Segment
Information

In June
2015, we announced a change in organizational structure to align to
our strategic direction as a productivity and platform company.
During the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, our chief operating
decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, requested
changes in the information that he regularly reviews for purposes
of allocating resources and assessing performance. As a result,
beginning in fiscal year 2016, we report our financial performance
based on our new segments described in Note 21 - Segment
Information and Geographic Data. We have recast certain prior
period amounts to conform to the way we internally manage and
monitor segment performance during fiscal year 2016. This change
primarily impacted Note 10 - Goodwill, Note 15 - 
Unearned Revenue, and Note 21 - Segment Information and
Geographic Data, with no impact on consolidated net income or cash
flows.

Estimates and
Assumptions

Preparing
financial statements requires management to make estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets,
liabilities, revenue, and expenses. Examples of estimates include:
loss contingencies; product warranties; the fair value of, and/or
potential impairment of goodwill and intangible assets, for our
reporting units; product life cycles; useful lives of our tangible
and intangible assets; allowances for doubtful accounts; allowances
for product returns; the market value of and volume of demand for
our inventory; and stock-based compensation forfeiture rates.
Examples of assumptions include: the elements comprising a software
arrangement, including the distinction between upgrades or
enhancements and new products; when technological feasibility is
achieved for our products; the potential outcome of future tax
consequences of events that have been recognized on our
consolidated financial statements or tax returns; and determining
when investment impairments are other-than-temporary. Actual
results and outcomes may differ from management’s estimates
and assumptions.

Foreign
Currencies

Assets
and liabilities recorded in foreign currencies are translated at
the exchange rate on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses
are translated at average rates of exchange prevailing during the
year. Translation adjustments resulting from this process are
recorded to other comprehensive income
(“ OCI”).

Product Revenue and
Service and Other Revenue

Service
revenue exceeded 10% of total revenue for the first time in fiscal
year 2016. As a result, we have separately disclosed product
revenue and service and other revenue on our consolidated income
statements.

Product
revenue includes sales from operating systems; cross-device
productivity applications; server applications; business solution
applications; desktop and server management tools; software
development tools; video games; hardware such as PCs, tablets,
gaming and entertainment consoles, phones, other intelligent
devices, and related accessories; and training and certification of
computer system integrators and developers.

Service
and other revenue includes sales from cloud-based solutions that
provide customers with software, services, platforms, and content
such as Office 365, Microsoft Azure (“ Azure”),
Microsoft Dynamics (“ Dynamics”) CRM Online, and Xbox
Live; solution support; and consulting services. Service and other
revenue also includes sales from online advertising.

Revenue
Recognition

Revenue
is recognized when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists,
delivery has occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and
collectability is probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of
allowances for returns and any taxes collected from customers and
subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.

Revenue
recognition for multiple-element arrangements requires judgment to
determine if multiple elements exist, whether elements can be
accounted for as separate units of accounting, and if so, the fair
value for each of the elements.

Microsoft
enters into arrangements that can include various combinations of
software, services, and hardware. Where elements are delivered over
different periods of time, and when allowed under U. S. GAAP,
revenue is allocated to the respective elements based on their
relative selling prices at the inception of the arrangement, and
revenue is recognized as each element is delivered. We use a
hierarchy to determine the fair value to be used for allocating
revenue to elements: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of
fair value (“ VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence,
and (iii) best estimate of selling price (“ ESP”).
For software elements, we follow the industry specific software
guidance which only allows for the use of VSOE in establishing fair
value. Generally, VSOE is the price charged when the deliverable is
sold separately or the price established by management for a
product that is not yet sold if it is probable that the price will
not change before introduction into the marketplace. ESPs are
established as best estimates of what the selling prices would be
if the deliverables were sold regularly on a stand-alone basis. Our
process for determining ESPs requires judgment and considers
multiple factors that may vary over time depending upon the unique
facts and circumstances related to each deliverable.

Revenue
for retail packaged products, products licensed to original
equipment manufacturers (“ OEMs”), and perpetual
licenses under certain volume licensing programs generally is
recognized as products are shipped or made available.

Technology guarantee programs are accounted for as
multiple-element arrangements as customers receive free or
significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a
software product if they license existing versions of the product
during the eligibility period. Revenue is allocated between the
existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the
new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The
revenue allocation is based on the VSOE of fair value of the
products. The VSOE of fair value for upcoming new products are
based on the price determined by management having the relevant
authority when the element is not yet sold separately, but is
expected to be sold in the near future at the price set by
management.

Software
updates that will be provided free of charge are evaluated on a
case-by-case basis to determine whether they meet the definition of
an upgrade and create a multiple-element arrangement, which may
require revenue to be deferred and recognized when the upgrade is
delivered, or if it is determined that implied post-contract
customer support (“ PCS”) is being provided, the
arrangement is accounted for as a multiple-element arrangement and
all revenue from the arrangement is deferred and recognized over
the implied PCS term when the VSOE of fair value does not exist. If
updates are determined to not meet the definition of an upgrade,
revenue is generally recognized as products are shipped or made
available.

Customers
purchasing a Windows 10 license will receive unspecified updates
and upgrades over the life of their Windows 10 device at no
additional cost. As these updates and upgrades will not be sold on
a stand-alone basis, we are unable to establish VSOE of fair value.
Accordingly, revenue from licenses of Windows 10 is recognized
ratably over the estimated life of the related device, which ranges
between two to four years.

Certain
volume licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for
current products combined with rights to receive unspecified future
versions of software products, which we have determined are
additional software products and are therefore accounted for as
subscriptions, with billings recorded as unearned revenue and
recognized as revenue ratably over the coverage period.
Arrangements that include term-based licenses for current products
with the right to use unspecified future versions of the software
during the coverage period, are also accounted for as
subscriptions, with revenue recognized ratably over the coverage
period. Revenue from cloud-based services arrangements that allow
for the use of a hosted software product or service over a
contractually determined period of time without taking possession
of software are accounted for as subscriptions with billings
recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue ratably over
the coverage period beginning on the date the service is made
available to customers. Revenue from cloud-based services
arrangements that are provided on a consumption basis (for example,
the amount of storage used in a particular period) is recognized
commensurate with the customer utilization of such
resources.

Some
volume licensing arrangements include time-based subscriptions for
cloud-based services and software offerings that are accounted for
as subscriptions. These arrangements are considered
multiple-element arrangements. However, because all elements are
accounted for as subscriptions and have the same coverage period
and delivery pattern, they have the same revenue recognition
timing.

Revenue
related to Microsoft Surface (“ Surface”) devices, Xbox
consoles, games published by us, phones, and other hardware
components is generally recognized when ownership is transferred to
the resellers or to end customers when selling directly through
Microsoft retail stores and online marketplaces. A portion of
revenue may be deferred when these products are combined with
software elements, and/or services. Revenue related to licensing
for games published by third parties for use on the Xbox consoles
is recognized when games are manufactured by the game
publishers.

Display
advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed.
Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the
search results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has
been completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as
services are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly
rate in the consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked
during the period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services
arrangements is recognized as services are provided.

Cost of
Revenue

Cost of
revenue includes: manufacturing and distribution costs for products
sold and programs licensed; operating costs related to product
support service centers and product distribution centers; costs
incurred to include software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic
to our websites, and to acquire online advertising space; costs
incurred to support and maintain Internet-based products and
services, including datacenter costs and royalties; warranty costs;
inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery
of consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized
software development costs. Capitalized software development costs
are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.

Product
Warranty

We
provide for the estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under
hardware and software warranties at the time the related revenue is
recognized. For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on
historical and projected product failure rates, historical and
projected repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures
(if any). The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary
depending upon the product sold and the country in which we do
business, but generally include parts and labor over a period
generally ranging from 90 days to three years. For software
warranties, we estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as
security patches, over the estimated life of the software. We
regularly reevaluate our estimates to assess the adequacy of the
recorded warranty liabilities and adjust the amounts as
necessary.

Research and
Development

Research
and development expenses include payroll, employee benefits,
stock-based compensation expense, and other headcount-related
expenses associated with product development. Research and
development expenses also include third-party development and
programming costs, localization costs incurred to translate
software for international markets, and the amortization of
purchased software code and services content. Such costs related to
software development are included in research and development
expense until the point that technological feasibility is reached,
which for our software products, is generally shortly before the
products are released to manufacturing. Once technological
feasibility is reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to
cost of revenue over the estimated lives of the
products.

Sales and
Marketing

Sales and
marketing expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of
advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was
$1.6 billion, $1.9 billion, and $2.3 billion in fiscal years 2016,
2015, and 2014, respectively.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Compensation cost for stock awards is measured at the fair
value on the grant date and recognized as expense, net of estimated
forfeitures, over the related service period using the
straight-line method. The fair value of stock awards is based on
the quoted price of our common stock on the grant date less the
present value of expected dividends not received during the vesting
period. Compensation expense for the employee stock purchase plan
(“ ESPP”) is measured as the discount the employee is
entitled to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of
purchase.

Income
Taxes

Income
tax expense includes U. S. and international income taxes, the
provision for U. S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international
subsidiaries not deemed to be permanently reinvested, and interest
and penalties on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and
expenses are not reported in tax returns and financial statements
in the same year. The tax effect of such temporary differences is
reported as deferred income taxes. Deferred tax assets are reported
net of a valuation allowance when it is more likely than not that a
tax benefit will not be realized. All deferred income taxes are
classified as long-term on our consolidated balance
sheets.

Fair Value
Measurements

We
account for certain assets and liabilities at fair value. The
hierarchy below lists three levels of fair value based on the
extent to which inputs used in measuring fair value are observable
in the market.  We categorize each of our fair value
measurements in one of these three levels based on the lowest level
input that is significant to the fair value measurement in its
entirety. These levels are:

  Level 1 – inputs are based upon                                      

  Level 2 – inputs are based upon                                      

  Level 3 – inputs are generally                                       

We
measure certain assets, including our cost and equity method
investments, at fair value on a nonrecurring basis when they are
deemed to be other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of
these investments are determined based on valuation techniques
using the best information available, and may include quoted market
prices, market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections.
An impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be
other-than-temporary.

Our other
current financial assets and our current financial liabilities have
fair values that approximate their carrying values.

Financial
Instruments

Investments

We
consider all highly liquid interest-earning investments with a
maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase to be cash
equivalents. The fair values of these investments approximate their
carrying values. In general, investments with original maturities
of greater than three months and remaining maturities of less than
one year are classified as short-term investments. Investments with
maturities beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on
their highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities
represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI.

Equity
and other investments classified as long-term include both debt and
equity instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in the
market value of available-for-sale securities, excluding
other-than-temporary impairments, are reflected in OCI. Common and
preferred stock and other investments that are restricted for more
than one year or are not publicly traded are recorded at cost or
using the equity method.

We lend
certain fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment
returns. These transactions are accounted for as secured borrowings
and the loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on
our consolidated balance sheets. Cash and/or security interests are
received as collateral for the loaned securities with the amount
determined based upon the underlying security lent and the
creditworthiness of the borrower. Cash received is recorded as an
asset with a corresponding liability.

Investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in
fair value is judged to be other-than-temporary. Fair value is
calculated based on publicly available market information or other
estimates determined by management. We employ a systematic
methodology on a quarterly basis that considers available
quantitative and qualitative evidence in evaluating potential
impairment of our investments. If the cost of an investment exceeds
its fair value, we evaluate, among other factors, general market
conditions, credit quality of debt instrument issuers, the duration
and extent to which the fair value is less than cost, and for
equity securities, our intent and ability to hold, or plans to
sell, the investment. For fixed-income securities, we also evaluate
whether we have plans to sell the security or it is more likely
than not that we will be required to sell the security before
recovery. We also consider specific adverse conditions related to
the financial health of and business outlook for the investee,
including industry and sector performance, changes in technology,
and operational and financing cash flow factors. Once a decline in
fair value is determined to be other-than-temporary, an impairment
charge is recorded to other income (expense), net and a new cost
basis in the investment is established.

Derivatives

Derivative instruments are recognized as either assets or
liabilities and are measured at fair value. The accounting for
changes in the fair value of a derivative depends on the intended
use of the derivative and the resulting designation.

For
derivative instruments designated as fair value hedges, the gains
(losses) are recognized in earnings in the periods of change
together with the offsetting losses (gains) on the hedged items
attributed to the risk being hedged. For options designated as fair
value hedges, changes in the time value are excluded from the
assessment of hedge effectiveness and are recognized in
earnings.

For
derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the gains (losses) on the derivatives is
initially reported as a component of OCI and is subsequently
recognized in earnings when the hedged exposure is recognized in
earnings. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in
the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and are recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on
derivatives representing either hedge components excluded from the
assessment of effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized
in earnings.

For
derivative instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains
(losses) from changes in fair values are primarily recognized in
other income (expense), net. Other than those derivatives entered
into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the
gains (losses) are generally economically offset by unrealized
gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale securities,
which are recorded as a component of OCI until the securities are
sold or other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts
are reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income
(“ AOCI”) into other income (expense), net.

Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The
allowance for doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of
probable losses inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We
determine the allowance based on known troubled accounts,
historical experience, and other currently available evidence.
Activity in the allowance for doubtful accounts was as
follows:

Inventories

Inventories are stated at average cost, subject to the lower of
cost or market. Cost includes materials, labor, and manufacturing
overhead related to the purchase and production of inventories. We
regularly review inventory quantities on hand, future purchase
commitments with our suppliers, and the estimated utility of our
inventory. If our review indicates a reduction in utility below
carrying value, we reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through
a charge to cost of revenue.

Property and
Equipment

Property
and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation, and
depreciated using the straight-line method over the shorter of the
estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term. The estimated
useful lives of our property and equipment are generally as
follows: computer software developed or acquired for internal use,
three to seven years; computer equipment, two to three years;
buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold
improvements, three to 20 years; and furniture and equipment, one
to 10 years. Land is not depreciated.

Goodwill

Goodwill
is tested for impairment at the reporting unit level (operating
segment or one level below an operating segment) on an annual basis
(May 1 for us) and between annual tests if an event occurs or
circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the
fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value.

Intangible
Assets

All of
our intangible assets are subject to amortization and are amortized
using the straight-line method over their estimated period of
benefit, ranging from one to 15 years. We evaluate the
recoverability of intangible assets periodically by taking into
account events or circumstances that may warrant revised estimates
of useful lives or that indicate the asset may be
impaired.

Recent Accounting
Guidance

Recently adopted
accounting guidance

Improvements to
Employee Share-Based Payment Accounting

In March
2016, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”)
issued a new standard that changes the accounting for certain
aspects of share-based payments to employees. The new guidance
requires excess tax benefits and tax deficiencies to be recorded in
the income statement when stock awards vest or are settled. In
addition, cash flows related to excess tax benefits will no longer
be separately classified as a financing activity apart from other
income tax cash flows. The standard also allows us to repurchase
more of an employee’s vesting shares for tax withholding
purposes without triggering liability accounting, clarifies that
all cash payments made to tax authorities on an employee’s
behalf for withheld shares should be presented as a financing
activity on our cash flows statement, and provides an accounting
policy election to account for forfeitures as they occur. The new
standard is effective for us beginning July 1, 2017, with
early adoption permitted.

We
elected to early adopt the new guidance in the third quarter of
fiscal year 2016 which requires us to reflect any adjustments as of
July 1, 2015, the beginning of the annual period that includes
the interim period of adoption. The primary impact of adoption was
the recognition of excess tax benefits in our provision for income
taxes rather than paid-in capital for all periods in fiscal year
2016.  Additional amendments to the accounting for income taxes
and minimum statutory withholding tax requirements had no impact to
retained earnings as of July 1, 2015, where the cumulative
effect of these changes are required to be recorded. We have
elected to continue to estimate forfeitures expected to occur to
determine the amount of compensation cost to be recognized in each
period.

We
elected to apply the presentation requirements for cash flows
related to excess tax benefits retrospectively to all periods
presented which resulted in an increase to both net cash from
operations and net cash used in financing of $588 million and $271
million for the years ended June 30, 2015 and 2014,
respectively. The presentation requirements for cash flows related
to employee taxes paid for withheld shares had no impact to any of
the periods presented on our consolidated cash flows statements
since such cash flows have historically been presented as a
financing activity.

Adoption
of the new standard resulted in the recognition of excess tax
benefits in our provision for income taxes rather than paid-in
capital of $402 million for the year ended June 30,
2016.

Balance Sheet
Classification of Deferred Taxes

In
November 2015, the FASB issued guidance that requires companies to
classify all deferred tax assets and liabilities as noncurrent on
the balance sheet rather than separately disclosing deferred taxes
as current and noncurrent. This standard is effective for us
beginning July 1, 2017, and can be early adopted and applied
either prospectively or retrospectively to all periods presented
upon adoption.

We
elected to early adopt the new guidance in the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2016 on a retrospective basis. While the guidance
changes the manner in which deferred taxes are classified on the
balance sheet, we are still required to offset deferred tax assets
and liabilities for each taxpaying component within a tax
jurisdiction. Adoption of the new standard impacted our previously
reported results as follows:

  (In millions)                      June 30,                              
                                                                           
                                     2015

Financial Instruments
 - Credit Losses

In June
2016, the FASB issued a new standard to replace the incurred loss
impairment methodology in current GAAP with a methodology that
reflects expected credit losses and requires consideration of a
broader range of reasonable and supportable information to inform
credit loss estimates. For trade and other receivables, loans, and
other financial instruments, we will be required to use a
forward-looking expected loss model rather than the incurred loss
model for recognizing credit losses which reflects losses that are
probable. Credit losses relating to available-for-sale debt
securities will also be recorded through an allowance for credit
losses rather than as a reduction in the amortized cost basis of
the securities. The new standard will be effective for us beginning
July 1, 2020, with early adoption permitted beginning
July 1, 2019. Application of the amendments is through a
cumulative-effect adjustment to retained earnings as of the
effective date. We are currently evaluating the impact of this
standard on our consolidated financial statements.

Leases

In
February 2016, the FASB issued a new standard related to leases to
increase transparency and comparability among organizations by
requiring the recognition of lease assets and lease liabilities on
the balance sheet. Most prominent among the amendments is the
recognition of assets and liabilities by lessees for those leases
classified as operating leases under previous U. S. GAAP. Under the
new standard, disclosures are required to meet the objective of
enabling users of financial statements to assess the amount,
timing, and uncertainty of cash flows arising from leases. We will
be required to recognize and measure leases at the beginning of the
earliest period presented using a modified retrospective
approach.

The new
standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2019, with
early adoption permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of
the new standard effective July 1, 2017 in conjunction with
our adoption of the new revenue standard.  Our ability to early
adopt is dependent on system readiness, including software procured
from third-party providers, and the completion of our analysis of
information necessary to restate prior period financial
statements.

We
anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to
assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe
the most significant impact relates to our accounting for office,
retail, and datacenter operating leases.

Financial Instruments
 - Recognition, Measurement, Presentation, and
Disclosure

In
January 2016, the FASB issued a new standard to amend certain
aspects of recognition, measurement, presentation, and disclosure
of financial instruments. Most prominent among the amendments is
the requirement for changes in the fair value of our equity
investments, with certain exceptions, to be recognized through net
income rather than OCI. The new standard will be effective for us
beginning July 1, 2018. The application of the amendments will
result in a cumulative-effect adjustment to our consolidated
balance sheets as of the effective date. We are currently
evaluating the impact of this standard on our consolidated
financial statements.

Revenue from Contracts
with Customers

In May
2014, the FASB issued a new standard related to revenue
recognition. Under the new standard, revenue is recognized when a
customer obtains control of promised goods or services and is
recognized in an amount that reflects the consideration which the
entity expects to receive in exchange for those goods or services.
In addition, the standard requires disclosure of the nature,
amount, timing, and uncertainty of revenue and cash flows arising
from contracts with customers. The FASB has recently issued several
amendments to the standard, including clarification on accounting
for licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance
obligations.

The
guidance permits two methods of adoption: retrospectively to each
prior reporting period presented (full retrospective method), or
retrospectively with the cumulative effect of initially applying
the guidance recognized at the date of initial application (the
cumulative catch-up transition method). We currently anticipate
adopting the standard using the full retrospective method to
restate each prior reporting period presented.

The new
standard will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2018, and
adoption as of the original effective date of July 1, 2017 is
permitted. We currently anticipate early adoption of the new
standard effective July 1, 2017. Our ability to early adopt
using the full retrospective method is dependent on system
readiness, including software procured from third-party providers,
and the completion of our analysis of information necessary to
restate prior period financial statements.

We
anticipate this standard will have a material impact on our
consolidated financial statements. While we are continuing to
assess all potential impacts of the standard, we currently believe
the most significant impact relates to our accounting for software
license revenue. We expect revenue related to hardware, cloud
offerings, and professional services to remain substantially
unchanged. Specifically, under the new standard we expect to
recognize Windows 10 revenue predominantly at the time of billing
rather than ratably over the life of the related device. We also
expect to recognize license revenue at the time of billing rather
than over the subscription period from certain multi-year
commercial software subscriptions that include both software
licenses and Software Assurance. Due to the complexity of certain
of our commercial license subscription contracts, the actual
revenue recognition treatment required under the standard will be
dependent on contract-specific terms, and may vary in some
instances from recognition at the time of billing.

We
currently believe that the net change in Windows 10 revenue from
period to period is indicative of the net change in revenue we
expect from the adoption of the new standard.
