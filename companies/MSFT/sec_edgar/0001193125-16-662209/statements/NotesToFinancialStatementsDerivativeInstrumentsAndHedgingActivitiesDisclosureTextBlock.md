DERIVATIVES

We use derivative
instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity
prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns;
and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for
holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently
managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as
possible.

Our derivative programs
include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are
measured in U. S. dollar equivalents.

Foreign Currency

Certain forecasted
transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign
currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to
maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge
positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion
of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the
future and are designated as cash flow hedging instruments.
Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, Canadian dollar, and Australian dollar. As of June 30,
2016 and June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these
foreign exchange contracts sold were $8.4 billion and $9.8 billion,
respectively.

Foreign currency risks
related to certain non-U. S. dollar denominated securities are
hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that are designated
as fair value hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2016 and
June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign
exchange contracts sold were $5.3 billion for both
periods.

Certain options and
forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also used to
manage the variability in foreign exchange rates on certain balance
sheet amounts and to manage other foreign currency
exposures.  As of June 30, 2016, the total notional
amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were
$12.0 billion and $11.7 billion, respectively. As of June 30,
2015, the total notional amounts of these foreign exchange
contracts purchased and sold were $9.7 billion and $11.0 billion,
respectively.

Equity

Securities held in our
equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price
risk.  Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based
global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible
preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not
designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our
price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging
instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.  As of
June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of equity contracts
purchased and sold for managing market price risk were $1.3 billion
and $2.2 billion, respectively, of which $737 million and $986
million, respectively, were designated as hedging instruments. As
of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts of equity
contracts purchased and sold for managing market price risk were
$2.2 billion and $2.6 billion, respectively, of which $1.1 billion
and $1.4 billion, respectively, were designated as hedging
instruments.

Interest Rate

Securities held in our
fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks
based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate
to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded
option and futures contracts, and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As
of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest
rate contracts purchased and sold were $328 million and $2.4
billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional
amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were
$1.0 billion and $3.2 billion, respectively.

In addition, we use
“ To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of
mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
securities.  These meet the definition of a derivative
instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not
taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30,
2016 and 2015, the total notional derivative amounts of mortgage
contracts purchased were $548 million and $812 million,
respectively.

Credit

Our fixed-income
portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade
securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as
hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to
broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We
use credit default swaps as they are a low-cost method of managing
exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As
of June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of credit
contracts purchased and sold were $440 million and $273 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts
of credit contracts purchased and sold were $618 million and $430
million, respectively.

Commodity

We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate
portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and option
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and
manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use
derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to
the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including,
but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of
June 30, 2016, the total notional amounts of commodity
contracts purchased and sold were $631 million and $162 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2015, the total notional amounts
of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $882 million and
$316 million, respectively.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent
Features

Certain of our
counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term
unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and
require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the
extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to
post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2016, our
long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were
in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required
to be posted.

Fair Values of Derivative
Instruments

The following table
presents the fair values of derivative instruments designated as
hedging instruments (“designated hedge derivatives”)
and not designated as hedging instruments (“non-designated
hedge derivatives”). The fair values exclude the impact of
netting derivative assets and liabilities when a legally
enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair value
adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty credit
risk:

We estimate that $319
million of net derivative gains included in AOCI as of
June 30, 2016 will be reclassified into earnings within the
following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were
reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted
transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year
2016.

Non-Designated Derivative Gains
(Losses)

Gains (losses) from
changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of
gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line
items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial
for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered
into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the
gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by
unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale
securities and gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on
certain balance sheet amounts.
