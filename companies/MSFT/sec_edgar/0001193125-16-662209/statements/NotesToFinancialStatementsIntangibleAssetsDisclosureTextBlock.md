The components of
intangible assets, all of which are finite-lived, were as
follows:

  (a)      Technology-based intangible assets included $115 million and      
           $116 million as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively, of       
           net carrying amount of software to be sold, leased, or otherwise  
           marketed.

In the
third quarter of fiscal year 2016, we corrected our intangible
assets in the table above for a $585 million misstatement between
gross carrying amount and accumulated amortization as of
June 30, 2015. We do not consider this correction to be
material, and there was no impact to our consolidated financial
statements.

During
fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million
related to intangible assets in the Devices reporting unit within
our More Personal Computing segment. In the fourth quarter of
fiscal year 2016, we tested these intangible assets for
recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances associated
with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability
expectations for our phone business. Based on the results of our
testing, we determined that the carrying value of the intangible
assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was recorded
to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying value. We
primarily used the income approach to determine the fair value of
the intangible assets and determine the amount of
impairment.

During
fiscal year 2015, we recorded impairment charges of $2.2 billion
related to intangible assets in our previous Phone Hardware
reporting unit. Phone Hardware intangible assets are included in
the Devices reporting unit under our current segment structure. In
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2015, we tested these intangible
assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances
associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced
profitability expectations for Phone Hardware. Based on the results
of our testing, we determined that the carrying value of the
intangible assets was not recoverable, and an impairment charge was
recorded to the extent that estimated fair value exceeded carrying
value. We primarily used a relief from royalty income approach to
determine the fair value of the intangible assets and determine the
amount of impairment.

These
intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment,
integration, and restructuring expenses on our consolidated income
statement, and reflected in Corporate and Other in our table of
operating income (loss) by segment in Note 21 - Segment
Information and Geographic Data.

We estimate that we have
no significant residual value related to our intangible
assets.

The components of
intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were as
follows:

Intangible assets amortization expense was $978 million, $1.3
billion, and $845 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014,
respectively. Amortization of capitalized software was $69 million,
$79 million, and $200 million for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and
2014, respectively.

The
following table outlines the estimated future amortization expense
related to intangible assets held as of June 30,
2016:
