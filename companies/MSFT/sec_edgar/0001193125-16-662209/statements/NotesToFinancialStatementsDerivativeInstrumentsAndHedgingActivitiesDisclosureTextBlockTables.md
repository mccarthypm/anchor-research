| *        Non-designated Hedge Derivatives* | Gains (losses) from
changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense), net.
These amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of
gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line
items other than other income (expense), net, which were immaterial
for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered
into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the
gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by
unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale
securities and gains (losses) from foreign exchange rate changes on
certain balance sheet amounts.
