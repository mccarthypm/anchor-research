Other
Commitments

On
June 11, 2016, we entered into a definitive agreement to
acquire LinkedIn Corporation (“ LinkedIn”) for $196 per
share in an all-cash transaction valued at $26.2 billion, inclusive
of LinkedIn’s net cash (the “ Merger Agreement”).
We will finance the transaction primarily through the issuance of
new indebtedness. The Merger Agreement has been unanimously
approved by the Boards of Directors of both Microsoft and LinkedIn,
and we expect the acquisition will close in the 2016 calendar year,
subject to approval by LinkedIn’s shareholders, satisfaction
of certain regulatory approvals, and other customary closing
conditions. The transaction is expected to accelerate the growth of
LinkedIn, as well as Office 365 and Dynamics.
