 -   RESTRUCTURING CHARGES

Phone Hardware
Integration

In July
2014, we announced a restructuring plan to simplify our
organization and align NDS with our company’s overall
strategy (the “ Phone Hardware Integration Plan”).
Pursuant to the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we eliminated
approximately 19,000 positions in fiscal year 2015, including
approximately 13,000 professional and factory positions related to
the NDS business. The actions associated with the Phone Hardware
Integration Plan were completed as of June 30,
2015.

In
connection with the Phone Hardware Integration Plan, we incurred
total restructuring charges of $1.3 billion, including severance
expenses and other reorganization costs, primarily associated with
our facilities consolidation and write-downs of certain assets. All
restructuring charges incurred under the Phone Hardware Integration
Plan were recognized in fiscal year 2015.

Phone Hardware
Restructuring

In June
2015, management approved a plan to restructure our phone business
to better focus and align resources (the “ Phone Hardware
Restructuring Plan”), under which we eliminated approximately
7,400 positions in fiscal year 2016.

In fiscal
year 2015, we incurred restructuring charges of $780 million under
the Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan, including severance expenses
and other reorganization costs. In fiscal year 2016, we reversed
$21 million of previously estimated restructuring charges related
to contract termination costs. The actions associated with the
Phone Hardware Restructuring Plan were substantially complete as of
June 30, 2016, and are expected to be completed by the end of
calendar year 2016.

2016
Restructuring

We
periodically evaluate how to best deploy the company’s
resources. In the fourth quarter of 2016, management approved
restructuring plans that would result in job eliminations,
primarily across our smartphone hardware business and global sales.
In addition to the elimination of 1,850 positions that were
announced in May 2016, approximately 2,850 roles globally will be
reduced during the year as an extension of the earlier plan, and
these actions are expected to be completed by the end of fiscal
year 2017.

In
connection with the restructuring plans, we incurred restructuring
charges of $501 million in fiscal year 2016, including severance
expenses and other reorganization costs. We do not expect to incur
additional charges for these restructuring plans in subsequent
years.

Restructuring charges associated with each of these plans were
included in impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses on
our consolidated income statement, and reflected in Corporate and
Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note
21 - Segment Information and Geographic Data.

Changes
in the restructuring liability were as follows:
