U. S. and foreign

In fiscal
year 2016, income before income taxes included the net impact of
U. S. and foreign revenue deferrals related to the sales of Windows
10 of $6.0 billion and $588 million, respectively. In fiscal year
2015, income before income taxes included the net impact of U. S.
and foreign impairment, integration, and restructuring expenses
relating to our phone business of $1.1 billion and $8.9 billion,
respectively.

The items
accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the
U. S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as
follows:

  Year Ended June 30,

  Foreign earnings taxed at lower      (19.4)%      (20.9)%      (17.1)%  
  Phone nondeductible charges and         1.3%        19.1%         0.9%  
  Domestic production activities        (0.6)%       (2.4)%       (1.0)%  
  Excess tax benefits relating to       (2.0)%           0%           0%  
  Other reconciling items,                0.7%         3.3%         2.9%  
  Effective rate                         15.0%        34.1%        20.7%  

The
reduction from the federal statutory rate is primarily due to
earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting
from producing and distributing our products and services through
our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland, Singapore, and
Puerto Rico. Our foreign regional operating centers, which are
taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, generated 69%, 73%, and
81% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2016, 2015,
and 2014, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist
of interest, U. S. state income taxes, and credits. In fiscal years
2016, 2015, and 2014, there were no individually significant other
reconciling items.

The
decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2016 compared to
fiscal year 2015 was primarily due to changes in the mix of our
income before income taxes between the U. S. and foreign countries,
including the net impact of revenue deferrals related to sales of
Windows 10, tax benefits from the adoption of the new accounting
guidance relating to stock-based compensation, and distributions
from foreign affiliates. The fiscal year 2015 effective tax rate
included the tax impact of losses in foreign jurisdictions for
which we may not realize a tax benefit, primarily as a result of
impairment and restructuring charges.

The
components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were
as follows:

           to balance sheet classification of deferred taxes. See Note 1

As of
June 30, 2016, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $8.0
billion, including $6.3 billion of foreign net operating loss
carryforwards. The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above
relates to the foreign net operating loss carryforwards and other
net deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Deferred
income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.

As of
June 30, 2016, we have not provided deferred U. S. income taxes
or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of
approximately $124.0 billion resulting from earnings for certain
non-U. S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the
U. S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these
temporary differences was approximately $39.3 billion as of
June 30, 2016.

Income
taxes paid were $3.9 billion, $4.4 billion, and $5.5 billion in
fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively.

Tax
contingencies and other income tax liabilities were $11.8 billion
and $12.1 billion as of June 30, 2016 and 2015, respectively,
and are included in other long-term liabilities. This decrease
relates primarily to tax credits available for carryover and a
partial settlement of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009,
offset by increases relating to intercompany transfer
pricing.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2016, 2015, and
2014, were $10.2 billion, $9.6 billion, and $8.7 billion,
respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our
effective tax rates for fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, by $8.8
billion, $7.9 billion, and $7.0 billion, respectively.

As of
June 30, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we had accrued interest expense
related to uncertain tax positions of $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion,
and $1.5 billion, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.
Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $163 million,
$237 million, and $235 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and
2014, respectively, and was included in provision for income
taxes.

The
aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were
as follows:

While we
settled a portion of our IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006
during the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and settled a portion
of the IRS audit for tax years 2007 to 2009 during the first
quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under audit for those years.
In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report
for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened the audit phase of the
examination. As of June 30, 2016, the primary unresolved issue
relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact
on our consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably.
We believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are
adequate. We have not received a proposed assessment for the
unresolved issues and do not expect a final resolution of these
issues in the next 12 months.  Based on the information
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or
decrease to our tax contingencies for these issues within the next
12 months. We also continue to be subject to examination by the IRS
for tax years 2010 to 2016.

We are
subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination
for tax years 1996 to 2016, some of which are currently under audit
by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not
expected to be material to our consolidated financial
statements.
