As of June 30, 2016
and 2015, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are
restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were
$767 million and $561 million, respectively. These investments are
carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of
other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to
reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.

As of June 30, 2016
and 2015, the collateral received under agreements for loaned
securities totaled $294 million and $92 million, which is primarily
comprised of U. S. government and agency securities.

continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 months
or greater and their related fair values were as
follows:

Unrealized losses from
fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in
interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international
equities are due to market price movements. Management does not
believe any remaining unrealized losses represent
other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of
available evidence.
