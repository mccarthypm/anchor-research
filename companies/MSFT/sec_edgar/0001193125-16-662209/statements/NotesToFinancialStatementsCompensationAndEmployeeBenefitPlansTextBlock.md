We grant stock-based
compensation to employees and directors. As of June 30, 2016
an aggregate of 214 million shares were authorized for future

without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance
under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to
satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our
stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible
employees.

locations. Participating U. S. employees may contribute a portion of
their salary, subject to certain limitations. Beginning January
2016, we contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant
contributes in this plan, with a maximum employer contribution of
50% of the IRS contribution limit for the calendar year. Prior to
January 2016, we contributed fifty cents for each dollar of the
first 6% a participant contributed in this plan, with a maximum
contribution of the lesser of 3% of a participant’s earnings
or 3% of the IRS compensation limit for the calendar year. Matching
contributions for all plans were $549 million, $454 million, and
$420 million in fiscal years 2016, 2015, and 2014, respectively,
and were expensed as contributed.
