  (a)      Goodwill acquired during fiscal year 2014 related to the    

The
measurement periods for the valuation of assets acquired and
liabilities assumed end as soon as information on the facts and
circumstances that existed as of the acquisition dates becomes
available, but do not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in purchase
price allocations may require a recasting of the amounts allocated
to goodwill retroactive to the periods in which the acquisitions
occurred.

Any
change in the goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency
translations are presented as “ Other” in the above
table. Also included in “ Other” are business
dispositions and transfers between business segments due to
reorganizations, as applicable.

As
discussed in Note 21 - Segment Information and Geographic
Data, during the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our
organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices
and services company. This resulted in a change in our operating
segments and reporting units. We allocated goodwill to our new
reporting units using a relative fair value approach. In addition,
we completed an assessment of any potential goodwill impairment for
all reporting units immediately prior to the reallocation and
determined that no impairment existed.

Goodwill
Impairment

We test
goodwill for impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting
unit level using a discounted cash flow methodology with a
peer-based, risk-adjusted weighted average cost of capital. We
believe use of a discounted cash flow approach is the most reliable
indicator of the fair values of the businesses.

No
impairment of goodwill was identified as of May 1, 2014 or
May 1, 2013. Upon completion of the fiscal year 2012 test, the
goodwill of our OSD unit (in Devices and Consumer Other under our
current segment structure) was determined to be impaired. The
impairment was the result of the OSD unit experiencing slower than
projected growth in search queries and search advertising revenue
per query, slower growth in display revenue, and changes in the
timing and implementation of certain initiatives designed to drive
search and display revenue growth in the future. This goodwill
impairment charge of $6.2 billion also represented our accumulated
goodwill impairment as of June 30, 2014 and 2013.
