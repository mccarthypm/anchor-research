| *        Non-designated Hedge Derivatives* | Gains (losses) from
changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). These
amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains
(losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items
other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the
periods presented. Other than those derivatives entered into for
investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains
(losses) below are generally economically offset by unrealized
gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale
securities.
