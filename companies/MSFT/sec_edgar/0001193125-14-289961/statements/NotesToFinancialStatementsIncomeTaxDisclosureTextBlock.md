The items
accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the
U. S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as
follows:

  Effective rate                         20.7%        19.2%        23.8%  

The
reduction from the federal statutory rate from foreign earnings
taxed at lower rates results from producing and distributing our
products and services through our foreign regional operations
centers in Ireland, Singapore, and Puerto Rico. Our foreign
earnings, which are taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate and are
generated from our regional operating centers, were 81%, 79%, and
79% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2014, 2013,
and 2012, respectively. In general, other reconciling items consist
of interest, adjustments for intercompany transfer pricing, U. S.
state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and credits. In
fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, there were no individually
significant other reconciling items.

The
components of the deferred income tax assets and liabilities were
as follows:

As of
June 30, 2014, we had net operating loss carryforwards of $3.6
billion, including $2.2 billion of foreign net operating loss
carryforwards acquired through our acquisition of Skype, and $545
million through our acquisition of NDS. The valuation allowance
disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net operating
loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not
be realized.

Deferred
income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their
tax bases and are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in
effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered.

As of
June 30, 2014, we have not provided deferred U. S. income taxes
or foreign withholding taxes on temporary differences of
approximately $92.9 billion resulting from earnings for certain
non-U. S. subsidiaries which are permanently reinvested outside the
U. S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with these
temporary differences was approximately $29.6 billion at
June 30, 2014.

Income
taxes paid were $5.5 billion, $3.9 billion, and $3.5 billion in
fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2014, 2013, and
2012, were $8.7 billion, $8.6 billion, and $7.2 billion,
respectively. If recognized, these tax benefits would affect our
effective tax rates for fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, by $7.0
billion, $6.5 billion, and $6.2 billion, respectively.

As of
June 30, 2014, 2013, and 2012, we had accrued interest expense
related to uncertain tax positions of $1.5 billion, $1.3 billion,
and $939 million, respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.
Interest expense on unrecognized tax benefits was $235 million,
$400 million, and $154 million in fiscal years 2014, 2013, and
2012, respectively.

The
aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were
as follows:

During
the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, we reached a settlement of a
portion of an I. R. S. audit of tax years 2004 to 2006, which reduced
our income tax expense by $461 million. While we settled a portion
of the I. R. S. audit, we remain under audit for these years. In
February 2012, the I. R. S. withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report
and reopened the audit phase of the examination. As of
June 30, 2014, the primary unresolved issue relates to
transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact on our
consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We
believe our allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate.
We have not received a proposed assessment for the unresolved
issues and do not expect a final resolution of these issues in the
next 12 months.  Based on the information currently available,
we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to our tax
contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months. We also
continue to be subject to examination by the I. R. S. for tax years
2007 to 2013.

We are
subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination
for tax years 1996 to 2013, some of which are currently under audit
by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are not
expected to be material to our consolidated financial
statements.
