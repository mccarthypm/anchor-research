 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its
operation of the business, management, including our chief
operating decision maker, the company’s Chief Executive
Officer, reviews certain financial information, including segmented
internal profit and loss statements prepared on a basis not
consistent with U. S. GAAP. The segment information in this note is
reported on that basis.

During
the first quarter of fiscal year 2014, we changed our
organizational structure as part of our transformation to a devices
and services company. As a result, information that our chief
operating decision maker regularly reviews for purposes of
allocating resources and assessing performance changed. Therefore,
beginning in fiscal year 2014, we reported our financial
performance based on our new segments; D& C Licensing, D& C
Hardware, D& C Other, Commercial Licensing, and Commercial
Other. We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to
the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance
during fiscal year 2014.

On
April 25, 2014, we acquired substantially all of NDS. See Note
9 - Business Combinations for additional details. NDS has
been included in our consolidated results of operations starting on
the acquisition date. We report the financial performance of the
acquired business in our new Phone Hardware segment. Prior to the
acquisition of NDS, financial results associated with our joint
strategic initiatives with Nokia were reflected in our D& C
Licensing segment. The contractual relationship with Nokia related
to those initiatives terminated in conjunction with the
acquisition. With the creation of the new Phone Hardware segment,
the D& C Hardware segment was renamed Computing and Gaming
Hardware in the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014.

Our
reportable segments are described below.

Devices and
Consumer

Our
D& C segments develop, manufacture, market, and support products
and services designed to entertain and connect people, increase
personal productivity, help people simplify tasks and make more
informed decisions online, and help advertisers connect with
audiences. Our D& C segments are:

  D& C Licensing, comprising: Windows, including all                

  Computing and Gaming Hardware, comprising: Xbox gaming         

  Phone Hardware, comprising: Lumia Smartphones and other   

  D& C Other, comprising: Resale, including Windows                  

Commercial

Our
Commercial segments develop, market, and support software and
services designed to increase individual, team, and organizational
productivity and efficiency, including simplifying everyday tasks
through seamless operations across the user’s hardware and
software. Our Commercial segments are:

  Commercial Licensing, comprising: server products,              

  Commercial Other, comprising: Enterprise Services,                   

Revenue
and cost of revenue are generally directly attributed to our
segments. Certain revenue contracts are allocated among the
segments based on the relative value of the underlying products and
services. Cost of revenue is directly charged to our hardware
segments. For the remaining segments, cost of revenue is directly
charged in most cases and allocated in certain cases, generally
using a relative revenue methodology.

We do not
allocate operating expenses to our segments. Rather, we allocate
them to our two segment groups, Devices and Consumer and
Commercial. Due to the integrated structure of our business,
allocations of expenses are made in certain cases to incent
cross-collaboration among our segment groups so that a segment
group is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial
activity as we seek to deliver seamless experiences across devices,
whether on-premises or in the cloud.

Operating
expenses are attributed to our segment groups as
follows:

  Sales                                                           

  Research and development expenses are primarily shared across     

  General and administrative expenses are primarily allocated  

Certain
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segment groups,
including costs of: legal, including expenses, settlements, and
fines; information technology; human resources; finance; excise
taxes; and integration and restructuring costs.

Segment
revenue and gross margin were as follows during the periods
