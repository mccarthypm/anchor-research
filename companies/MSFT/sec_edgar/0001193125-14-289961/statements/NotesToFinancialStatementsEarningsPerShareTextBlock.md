PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share
(“ EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock
options and stock awards.

The components of basic and diluted
EPS are as follows:
