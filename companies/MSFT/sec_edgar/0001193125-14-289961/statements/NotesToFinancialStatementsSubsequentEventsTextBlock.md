SUBSEQUENT EVENT

On July 17, 2014, we
announced a restructuring plan to simplify our organization and
align the recently acquired NDS business with our company’s
overall strategy. We will eliminate up to 18,000 positions over the
next year, including 12,500 professional and factory positions
related to the acquisition of NDS. We expect to incur pre-tax
charges of approximately $1.1 billion to $1.6 billion in fiscal
year 2015.
