Nokia’s Devices
and Services Business

On
April 25, 2014, we completed the transaction to acquire
substantially all of NDS for a total purchase price of $9.5
billion, including cash acquired of $1.5 billion (“the
Acquisition”). The purchase price consisted primarily of cash
of $7.1 billion and Nokia’s repurchase of convertible notes
of $2.1 billion which was a non-cash transaction. The Acquisition
is expected to accelerate the growth of our Devices and Consumer
(“ D& C”) business through faster innovation,
synergies, and unified branding and marketing.

The
purchase price allocation as of the date of the Acquisition was
based on a preliminary valuation and is subject to revision as more
detailed analyses are completed and additional information about
the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed become
available.

The major
classes of assets and liabilities to which we have preliminarily
allocated the purchase price were as follows:

are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible
assets acquired:

  Fair value of intangible assets      $           4,509      8 years  

Our
consolidated income statement for fiscal year 2014 includes revenue
and operating loss of $2.0 billion and $692 million, respectively,
attributable to NDS since the Acquisition.

Following
are the supplemental consolidated results of Microsoft Corporation
on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the Acquisition had been
consummated on July 1, 2012:

  Year Ended June 30,                          2014                  2013

These pro
forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we
believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have
been realized had we been a combined company during the periods
presented and are not necessarily indicative of our consolidated
results of operations in future periods. The pro forma results
include adjustments primarily related to purchase accounting
adjustments and the elimination of related party transactions
between Microsoft and NDS. Acquisition costs and other
non-recurring charges incurred are included in the earliest period
presented.

During
the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2014, we incurred $21 million of
acquisition costs associated with the purchase of NDS. Acquisition
costs are primarily comprised of transaction fees and direct
acquisition costs, including legal, finance, consulting, and other
professional fees. These costs are included in Integration and
restructuring costs on our consolidated income statement for fiscal
year 2014.

Certain
concurrent transactions were recognized separately from the
Acquisition. Prior to the Acquisition, we had joint strategic
initiatives with Nokia; this contractual relationship was
terminated in conjunction with the Acquisition. No gain or loss was
recorded upon termination of this agreement, as it was determined
to be at market value. In addition, we agreed to license
Nokia’s mapping services and will pay Nokia separately for
the services provided under a four-year license as they are
rendered.

Yammer

On
July 18, 2012, we acquired Yammer, Inc.
(“ Yammer”), a leading provider of enterprise social
networks, for $1.1 billion in cash. Yammer will continue to develop
its standalone service and will add an enterprise social networking
service to Microsoft’s portfolio of complementary cloud-based
services. The major classes of assets to which we allocated the
purchase price were goodwill of $937 million and identifiable
intangible assets of $178 million. We assigned the goodwill to
Commercial Other under our current segment structure. Yammer was
consolidated into our results of operations starting on the
acquisition date.

Skype

On
October 13, 2011, we acquired Skype Global S.á r. l.
(“ Skype”), a leading global provider of software
applications and related Internet communications products based in
Luxembourg, for $8.6 billion, primarily in cash. The major classes
of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase price
were goodwill of $7.1 billion, identifiable intangible assets of
$1.6 billion, and unearned revenue of $222 million. The goodwill
recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily
attributable to our expectation of extending Skype’s brand
and the reach of its networked platform, while enhancing
Microsoft’s existing portfolio of real-time communications
products and services. We assigned the goodwill to the following
segments under our current segment structure: $5.6 billion to
Commercial Licensing, $1.4 billion to Computing and Gaming
Hardware, and $54 million to D& C Other. Skype was consolidated
into our results of operations starting on the acquisition
date.

Following
are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible
assets acquired:

  (In millions)

  Contract-based                   10      4 years   
  Total                         1,648      13 years  

Other

During
fiscal year 2014, we completed five additional acquisitions for
total consideration of $140 million, all of which was paid in cash.
These entities have been included in our consolidated results of
operations since their respective acquisition dates.

With the
exception of NDS, pro forma results of operations have not been
presented because the effects of the business combinations
described in this note, individually and in aggregate, were not
material to our consolidated results of operations.
