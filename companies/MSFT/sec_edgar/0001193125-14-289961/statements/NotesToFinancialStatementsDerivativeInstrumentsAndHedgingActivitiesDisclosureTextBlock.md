 - DERIVATIVES

We use
derivative instruments to manage risks related to foreign
currencies, equity prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance
investment returns; and to facilitate portfolio diversification.
Our objectives for holding derivatives include reducing,
eliminating, and efficiently managing the economic impact of these
exposures as effectively as possible. Our derivative programs
include strategies that both qualify and do not qualify for hedge
accounting treatment. All notional amounts presented below are
measured in U. S. dollar equivalents.

Foreign
Currency

Certain
forecasted transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to
foreign currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures
daily to maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign
currency hedge positions. Option and forward contracts are used to
hedge a portion of forecasted international revenue for up to three
years in the future and are designated as cash flow hedging
instruments. Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese
yen, British pound, and Canadian dollar. As of June 30, 2014
and June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of these foreign
exchange contracts sold were $4.9 billion and $5.1 billion,
respectively.

Foreign
currency risks related to certain non-U. S. dollar denominated
securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that
are designated as fair value hedging instruments. As of
June 30, 2014 and June 30, 2013, the total notional
amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold were $3.1 billion
and $407 million, respectively.

Certain
options and forwards not designated as hedging instruments are also
used to manage the variability in exchange rates on accounts
receivable, cash, and intercompany positions, and to manage other
foreign currency exposures.  As of June 30, 2014, the
total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts
purchased and sold were $6.2 billion and $8.5 billion,
respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts
of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were $5.0
billion and $7.9 billion, respectively.

Equity

Securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio
are subject to market price risk.  Market price risk is managed
relative to broad-based global and domestic equity indices using
certain convertible preferred investments, options, futures, and
swap contracts not designated as hedging instruments. From time to
time, to hedge our price risk, we may use and designate equity
derivatives as hedging instruments, including puts, calls, swaps,
and forwards.  As of June 30, 2014, the total notional
amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for managing market
price risk were $3.1 billion and $2.1 billion, respectively, of
which $362 million and $420 million, respectively, were designated
as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2013, the total
notional amounts of equity contracts purchased and sold for
managing market price risk were $898 million and $1.0 billion,
respectively, none of which were designated as hedging
instruments.

Interest
Rate

Securities held in our fixed-income portfolio are subject to
different interest rate risks based on their maturities. We manage
the average maturity of our fixed-income portfolio to achieve
economic returns that correlate to certain broad-based fixed-income
indices using exchange-traded option and futures contracts and
over-the-counter swap and option contracts, none of which are
designated as hedging instruments. As of June 30, 2014, the
total notional amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased
and sold were $503 million and $741 million, respectively. As of
June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest
rate contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $809
million, respectively.

In
addition, we use “ To Be Announced” forward purchase
commitments of mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency
mortgage-backed securities.  These meet the definition of a
derivative instrument in cases where physical delivery of the
assets is not taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of
June 30, 2014 and 2013, the total notional derivative amounts
of mortgage contracts purchased were $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion,
respectively.

Credit

Our
fixed-income portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of
investment-grade securities. We use credit default swap contracts,
not designated as hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures
relative to broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio
diversification. We use credit default swaps as they are a low cost
method of managing exposure to individual credit risks or groups of
credit risks. As of June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts
of credit contracts purchased and sold were $412 million and $440
million, respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the total notional
amounts of credit contracts purchased and sold were $377 million
and $501 million, respectively.

Commodity

We use
broad-based commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to
facilitate portfolio diversification. We use swaps, futures, and
option contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to
generate and manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We
use derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives
to the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including,
but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of
June 30, 2014, the total notional amounts of commodity
contracts purchased and sold were $1.4 billion and $408 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2013, the total notional amounts
of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $1.2 billion and
$249 million, respectively.

Credit-Risk-Related
Contingent Features

Certain
of our counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term
unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and
require us to maintain minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the
extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to
post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2014, our
long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were
in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral was required
to be posted.

Fair Values of
Derivative Instruments

The
following tables present the fair values of derivative instruments
designated as hedging instruments (“designated hedge
derivatives”) and not designated as hedging instruments
(“non-designated hedge derivatives”). The fair values
exclude the impact of netting derivative assets and liabilities
when a legally enforceable master netting agreement exists and fair
value adjustments related to our own credit risk and counterparty
credit risk:

We
estimate that $32 million of net derivative gains included in AOCI
at June 30, 2014 will be reclassified into earnings within the
following 12 months. No significant amounts of gains (losses) were
reclassified from AOCI into earnings as a result of forecasted
transactions that failed to occur during fiscal year
2014.

Non-Designated
Derivative Gains (Losses)

Gains
(losses) from changes in fair values of derivatives that are not
designated as hedges are primarily recognized in other income
(expense). These amounts are shown in the table below, with the
exception of gains (losses) on derivatives presented in income
statement line items other than other income (expense), which were
immaterial for the periods presented. Other than those derivatives
entered into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts,
the gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by
unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale
securities.
