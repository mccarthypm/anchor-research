In addition to the
investments in the table above, we also own corporate notes that
were purchased in connection with our agreement to lend $2.0
billion to the group that completed their acquisition of Dell on
October 29, 2013. These corporate notes are classified as
held-to-maturity investments and are included in equity and other
investments on the balance sheet.  As of June 30, 2014,
the amortized cost, recorded basis, and estimated fair value of
these corporate notes was $1.5 billion, $1.5 billion, and $1.7
billion, respectively, while their associated gross unrecognized
holding gains were $164 million.

As of June 30, 2014
and 2013, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock that are
restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were
$520 million and $395 million, respectively. These investments are
carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of
other-than-temporary impairment. It is not practicable for us to
reliably estimate the fair value of these investments.

Unrealized Losses on
Investments

Investments, excluding
those held-to-maturity, with continuous unrealized losses for less
than 12 months and 12 months or greater and their related fair
values were as follows:

As of June 30, 2014,
we did not hold any held-to-maturity investments that are in an
unrealized loss position.

Unrealized losses from
fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in
interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international
equities are due to market price movements. Management does not
believe any remaining unrealized losses represent
other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of
available evidence as of June 30, 2014.
