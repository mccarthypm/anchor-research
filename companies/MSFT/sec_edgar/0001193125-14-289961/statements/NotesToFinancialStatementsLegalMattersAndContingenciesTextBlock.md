 - CONTINGENCIES

Antitrust, Unfair
Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions

A large
number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits
were filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian
courts on behalf of various classes of direct and indirect
purchasers of our PC operating system and certain other software
products between 1999 and 2005.

We
obtained dismissals or reached settlements of all claims made in
the United States. Under the settlements, generally class members
can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be reimbursed for
purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer hardware
and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies
by state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of
those vouchers that are not issued or claimed (one-half to
two-thirds depending on the state). The total value of vouchers we
ultimately issue will depend on the number of class members who
make claims and are issued vouchers. We estimate the total
remaining cost of the settlements is approximately $400 million,
all of which had been accrued as of June 30, 2014.

Three
similar cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec,
Canada have not been settled. In March 2010, the court in the
British Columbia case certified it as a class action. The
plaintiffs successfully appealed a British Columbia Court of Appeal
decision reversing class certification and dismissing the case. In
October 2013, the Canadian Supreme Court reversed the appellate
court and reinstated part of the British Columbia case, which is
now scheduled for trial in September 2015. The other two cases were
inactive pending action by the Supreme Court on the British
Columbia case.

Other Antitrust
Litigation and Claims

Novell
litigation

In
November 2004, Novell, Inc. (“ Novell”) filed a
complaint in U. S. District Court for the District of Utah (later
transferred to federal court in Maryland), asserting antitrust and
unfair competition claims against us related to Novell’s
ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during
the period between June 1994 and March 1996. After the trial court
dismissed or granted summary judgment on a number of Novell’s
claims, trial of the one remaining claim took place in late 2011
and resulted in a mistrial. In July 2012, the trial court granted
Microsoft’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Novell
appealed this decision to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Tenth
Circuit, which affirmed the trial court’s decision in
September 2013. The Supreme Court denied Novell’s petition
for review in April 2014.

Go Computer
litigation

In June
2005, GO Computer Inc. and co-founder Jerry Kaplan filed a
complaint in California state court asserting antitrust claims
under the Cartwright Act related to the business of the former GO
Corporation in the early 1990s and its successor in interest,
Lucent Corporation in the early 2000s. All claims prior to June
2001 have been dismissed with prejudice as barred by the statute of
limitations. After a mini-trial on standing issues, the case is now
moving forward with discovery, and a trial is set for September
2015.

China State
Administration for Industry and Commerce
investigation

On July
28, 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State
Administration for Industry and Commerce (SAIC) had begun a formal
investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the
SAIC conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing,
Shanghai, Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAIC has stated the investigation
relates to compatibility, bundle sales, and file verification
issues related to Windows and Office software.

Patent and
Intellectual Property Claims

Motorola
litigation

In
October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints
against Motorola Mobility (“ Motorola”) with the
International Trade Commission (“ ITC”) and in U. S.
District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft
patents by Motorola’s Android devices. Since then, Microsoft
and Motorola have filed additional claims against each other with
the ITC, in federal district courts in Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida,
and California, and in courts in Germany and the United Kingdom.
The nature of the claims asserted and status of individual matters
are summarized below.

International Trade
Commission

In May
2012, the ITC issued a limited exclusion order against Motorola on
one Microsoft patent, which became effective in July 2012 and
was affirmed on appeal in December 2013. In July 2013, Microsoft
filed an action in U. S. District Court in Washington, D. C. seeking
an order to compel enforcement of the ITC’s May 2012 import
ban against infringing Motorola products by the Bureau of Customs
and Border Protection (“ CBP”), after learning that CBP
had failed to fully enforce the order.

In
November 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft with the
ITC alleging infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles
and accessories and seeking an exclusion order to prohibit
importation of the allegedly infringing Xbox products. At
Motorola’s request, the ITC terminated its investigation of
four Motorola patents. In March 2013, the ITC affirmed there was no
violation of the remaining Motorola patent. Motorola appealed the
ITC’s decision to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit.

U. S. District
Court

The
Seattle District Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a
companion to Microsoft’s ITC case against Motorola was stayed
pending the outcome of the ITC case.

In
November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in
U. S. District Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola breached its
commitments to standards-setting organizations to license to
Microsoft certain patents on reasonable and non-discriminatory
(“ RAND”) terms and conditions. Motorola has declared
these patents essential to the implementation of the H.264 video
standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In the Motorola ITC case
described above and in suits described below, Motorola or a
Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in
U. S. District Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In February 2012,
the Seattle District Court granted a partial summary judgment in
favor of Microsoft ruling that (1)  Motorola had committed to
standards organizations to license its declared-essential patents
on RAND terms and conditions; and (2)  Microsoft is a
third-party beneficiary of those commitments. After trial, the
Seattle District Court set per unit royalties for Motorola’s
H.264 and 802.11 patents, which resulted in an immaterial Microsoft
liability. In September 2013, following trial of Microsoft’s
breach of contract claim, a jury awarded $14.5 million in damages
to Microsoft. Motorola appealed.

Cases
filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the
exception of one currently stayed case in Wisconsin (a companion
case to Motorola’s ITC action), have been transferred to the
U. S District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek
damages as well as injunctive relief. The court has stayed these
cases on agreement of the parties.

  In the                                                             

  In the                                                              

  In                                                            

Germany

In July
2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against
Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries.

  Motorola asserts two patents (one now expired) are essential to     
  implementation of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges    
  that H.264 capable products including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media    
  Player, and Internet Explorer infringe those patents. In May 2012,  
  the court issued an injunction relating to all H.264 capable        
  Microsoft products in Germany, which Microsoft appealed. Orders in  
  the litigation pending in Seattle, Washington described above       
  enjoin Motorola from enforcing the German injunction.               
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Motorola asserts that one patent covers certain syncing              
  functionality in the ActiveSync protocol employed by Windows Phone   
  7, Outlook Mobile, Hotmail Mobile, Exchange Online, Exchange         
  Server, and Hotmail Server. In April 2013, the court stayed the      
  case pending the outcome of parallel proceedings in which Microsoft  
  is seeking to invalidate the patent. In November 2013, the Federal   
  Patent Court invalidated the originally issued patent claims, but    
  ruled that certain new amended claims were patentable. Both          
  Motorola and Microsoft appealed. In June 2014, the court reopened    
  infringement proceedings and scheduled a hearing in November         
  2014.                                                                
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Microsoft may be able to mitigate the adverse impact of any  
  injunction by altering its products to avoid Motorola’s      
  infringement claims.                                         
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Any                                                   

In
lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in 2011 and 2012, Microsoft
asserts that Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft patents
and is seeking damages and injunctions. In 2012, regional courts in
Germany issued injunctions on three of the Microsoft patents, which
Motorola appealed. One judgment has been affirmed on appeal (and
Motorola has further appealed), and the other two appeals are
pending. In actions filed separately by Motorola to invalidate
these patents, the Federal Patent Court in 2013 and 2014 held the
Microsoft patents invalid, and Microsoft appealed. For the cases in
which Microsoft obtained injunctions, if Motorola were to prevail
following all appeals, Motorola could have a claim against
Microsoft for damages caused by an erroneously granted
injunction.

United
Kingdom

In
December 2011, Microsoft filed an action against Motorola in the
High Court of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, in London,
England, seeking to revoke the UK part of the European patent
asserted by Motorola in Germany against the ActiveSync protocol. In
February 2012, Motorola counterclaimed alleging infringement of the
patent and seeking damages and an injunction. In December 2012, the
court ruled that Motorola’s patent is invalid. The court also
ruled that the patent, even if valid, would be licensed under the
grant-back clause in Google’s ActiveSync license. Motorola
appealed and the appeals court affirmed the lower court’s
ruling in Microsoft’s favor in November 2013. Motorola has
exhausted all appeals and the rulings in Microsoft’s favor
are final.

IPCom patent
litigation

IPCom
GmbH & Co. is a German company that holds a large
portfolio of mobile technology related patents spanning about 170
patent families and addressing a broad range of cellular
technologies. IPCom has asserted 19 of these patents in litigation
against Nokia and many of the leading cell phone companies and
operators. Three of the infringement suits against Nokia (now
assumed by Microsoft through the NDS acquisition) are still pending
in courts in Germany, England, and Italy. These courts have held a
number of IPCom’s patents were invalid or not infringed. We
continue to contest the validity or infringement of the patents
remaining in dispute.

Interdigital patent
litigation

InterDigital Technology Corporation and InterDigital
Communications Corporation (collectively, “ IDT”) filed
four patent infringement cases against Nokia in the ITC and in U. S.
District Court for the District of Delaware between 2007 and 2013.
We are being substituted for Nokia in these cases. Each case
includes other co-defendants because most of the patents at issue
allegedly relate to 3G and 4G wireless communications standards
essential functionality. The suite of cases include three ITC
investigations where IDT is seeking an order excluding importation
of 3G and 4G phones into the U. S. and one active case in U. S.
District Court in Delaware seeking an injunction and
damages.

European copyright
levies

We have
assumed from Nokia all potential liability due to Nokia’s
alleged failure to pay “private copying levies” in
various European countries based upon sale of memory cards and
mobile phones that incorporate blank memory.  The levies are
based upon a 2001 EU Directive establishing a right for end users
to make copies of copyrighted works for personal or private use,
but also allowing the collection of levies based upon sales of
blank media or recording devices to compensate copyright holders
for private copying.  Various collecting societies in EU
countries initiated litigation against Nokia, stating that Nokia
must pay levies not only based upon sales of blank memory cards,
but also phones that include blank memory for data storage on the
phones, regardless of actual usage of that memory.  The most
significant cases against Nokia are pending in Germany and Austria,
due to both high volume of sales and high levy amounts sought in
these countries.  We are litigating against certain collecting
societies on the basis that the levy schemes exceed what the EU
Directive and European Court of Justice decisions
permit.

Other patent and
intellectual property claims

In
addition to these cases, there are approximately 90 other patent
infringement cases pending against Microsoft.

Product-Related
Litigation

U. S. cell phone
litigation

Nokia,
along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
defendant in 19 lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the
District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege that radio
emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and
other adverse health effects. We have assumed responsibility for
these claims as part of the NDS acquisition. Nine of these cases
were filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial
proceedings; the remaining ten cases are stayed. In a separate 2009
decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia held
that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular
handsets that operate within the U. S. Federal Communications
Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“ FCC
Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs
allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC
Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into
effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to
manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines. In
September 2013, defendants in the consolidated cases moved to
exclude plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on
the basis of flawed scientific methodologies. The motion was heard
in December 2013 and January 2014. In March 2014, defendants filed
a separate motion to preclude plaintiffs’ general causation
testimony on the ground that it is pre-empted by federal law
because the experts challenge the safety of all cellular handsets,
including those that comply with the FCC Guidelines. Both motions
are pending.

Canadian cell phone
class action

Nokia,
along with other handset manufacturers and network operators, is a
defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme Court
of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used
cellular phones for at least 1600 hours, including a subclass of
users with brain tumors. Microsoft was served with the complaint in
June 2014. The litigation is not yet active as several defendants
remain to be served.

Other

We also
are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from
time to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although
management currently believes that resolving claims against us,
individually or in aggregate, will not have a material adverse
impact on our consolidated financial statements, these matters are
subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of
these matters may change in the future.

As of
June 30, 2014, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $780
million in other current liabilities and $81 million in other
long-term liabilities for all of our legal matters that were
contingencies as of that date. While we intend to defend these
matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach
approximately $2.0 billion in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are
reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur,
there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our
consolidated financial statements for the period in which the
effects become reasonably estimable. Substantially all changes from
the prior quarter in these accruals and estimates are attributable
to matters involving Nokia that we assumed as a result of the NDS
acquisition.
