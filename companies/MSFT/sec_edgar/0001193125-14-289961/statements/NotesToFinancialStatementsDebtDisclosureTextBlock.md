DEBT

As of June 30, 2014,
we had $22.6 billion of issued and outstanding debt, comprising
$2.0 billion of short-term debt and $20.6 billion of long-term
debt. As of June 30, 2013, we had $15.6 billion of issued and
outstanding long-term debt.

Short-term Debt

As of June 30, 2014,
we had $2.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding,
with a weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities
ranging from 86 days to 91 days. The estimated fair value of this
commercial paper approximates its carrying value.

We have a $5.0 billion
credit facility that expires on November 14, 2018, which
serves as a back-up for our commercial paper program. As of
June 30, 2014, we were in compliance with the only financial
covenant in the credit agreement, which requires us to maintain a
coverage ratio of at least three times earnings before interest,
taxes, depreciation, and amortization to interest expense, as
defined in the credit agreement. No amounts were drawn against the
credit facility during any of the periods presented.

Long-term Debt

As of June 30, 2014,
the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term
debt were $20.6 billion and $21.5 billion, respectively. This is
compared to a carrying value and estimated fair value of our
long-term debt, including the current portion, of $15.6 billion and
$15.8 billion, respectively, as of June 30, 2013. These
estimated fair values are based on Level 2 inputs.

The components of our
long-term debt and the associated interest rates were as follows as
of June 30, 2014 and 2013:
