EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS

We grant stock-based
compensation to directors and employees. At June 30, 2014, an
aggregate of 346 million shares were authorized for future
grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards,
and leadership stock awards. Awards that expire or are canceled
without delivery of shares generally become available for issuance
under the plans. We issue new shares of Microsoft common stock to
satisfy exercises and vesting of awards granted under all of our
stock plans.

Stock awards

Stock awards
(“ SAs”) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of
Microsoft common stock as the award vests. SAs generally vest over
a four or five-year period.

Executive incentive
plan

Under the Executive
Incentive Plan (“ EIP”), the Compensation Committee
awards performance-based compensation comprising both cash and SAs
to executive officers and certain senior executives. For executive
officers, their awards are based on an aggregate incentive pool
equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. For fiscal
years 2014, 2013, and 2012, the pool was 0.44%, 0.35%, and 0.30% of
operating income, respectively. The SAs vest ratably in August of
each of the four years following the grant date. The final cash
awards will be determined after each performance period based on
individual and business performance.

Activity for all stock
plans

The fair value of each
award was estimated on the date of grant using the following
assumptions:

Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at
three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last
trading day of each three-month period. Employees may purchase
shares having a value not exceeding 15% of their gross compensation
during an offering period. Employees purchased the following shares

  (Shares in millions)

At June 30, 2014,
173 million shares of our common stock were reserved for
future issuance through the Plan.

Savings Plan

We have a savings plan in
the U. S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international
locations. Participating U. S. employees may contribute up to 75% of
their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute
fifty cents for each dollar of the first 6% a participant
contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of the lesser
of 3% of a participant’s earnings or 3% of the IRS
compensation limit for the given year. Matching contributions for
all plans were $420 million, $393 million, and $373 million in
fiscal years 2014, 2013, and 2012, respectively, and were expensed
as contributed. Matching contributions are invested proportionate
to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the
investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in
the U. S. plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither
participant nor our matching contributions are required to be
invested in Microsoft common stock.
