COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

Construction and Operating
Leases

We have committed $347
million for constructing new buildings, building improvements and
leasehold improvements as of June 30, 2010.

We have operating leases
for most U. S. and international sales and support offices and
certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases
was $530 million, $475 million, and $398 million, in fiscal years
2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively. Future minimum rental
commitments under noncancellable facilities operating leases in
place as of June 30, 2010 are as follows:

  2015 and thereafter         677  
  Total                     1,898  

Indemnifications

We provide
indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers
against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third
parties arising from the use of our products and certain other
matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications,
and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate
of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant
costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any
liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial
statements.

Yahoo! Commercial
Agreement

On December 4, 2009,
we entered into a definitive agreement with Yahoo! whereby
Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search
platform for Yahoo! Web sites. The transaction received clearance,
without restrictions, from both the U. S. Department of Justice and
the European Commission during the third fiscal quarter of 2010.
The term of the agreement is 10 years subject to termination
provisions after five years based on performance.

Microsoft provided Yahoo!
country level revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18
months after implementation of the Bing search platform. These
guarantees are calculated, paid, and trued-up in three six-month
periods thereafter, and are intended to insure Yahoo! against any
persistent drop in revenue per search from pre-implementation
levels. This is a rate guarantee not a guarantee of search volume.
We estimate the total cost of the revenue per search guarantees
during the guarantee period could range between zero and $150
million; however, no amount has been recorded for the revenue per
search guarantees as we do not believe that such liability exists
at this time.

Microsoft also agreed to
reimburse Yahoo! for certain transition expenses incurred both
before and after the effective date of the agreement.

Finally, Microsoft also
agreed to reimburse Yahoo! for certain costs of running algorithmic
and paid search services prior to migration to Microsoft’s
platform.

The changes in our
aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other
current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance
