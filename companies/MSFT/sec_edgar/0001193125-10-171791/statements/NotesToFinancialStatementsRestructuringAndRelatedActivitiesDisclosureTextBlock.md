EMPLOYEE SEVERANCE

In January 2009, we
announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce
discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital
expenditures. As part of this program, we announced the elimination
of 5,000 positions in research and development, marketing, sales,
finance, legal, human resources, and information technology. As of
September 30, 2009, we had reduced our overall number of
positions by approximately 5,000 and headcount by approximately
4,600.

In November 2009, we
identified an additional 800 positions for elimination based on our
efforts to manage our expenses. Severance expense of approximately
$52 million associated with these additional eliminations was
reflected in our financial statements. We have now completed this
program and reduced our overall headcount by approximately
5,300.

The changes in our
employee severance liabilities related to our resource management
efforts were as follows:
