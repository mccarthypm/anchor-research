UNEARNED REVENUE

Unearned revenue
comprises mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs,
as well as payments for undelivered elements and for other
offerings for which we earn the revenue when we provide the service
or software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition
criteria.

Volume Licensing
Programs

Unearned revenue from
volume licensing programs represents customer billings for
multi-year licensing arrangements paid either at inception of the
agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage
period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized
ratably over the billing coverage period.

Undelivered
Elements

Undelivered elements
consist mainly of payments for unspecified upgrades or enhancements
of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a when-and-if-available basis for
Windows XP, and technology guarantee programs.

Other

Also included in unearned
revenue are payments for post-delivery support and consulting
services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions;
Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products; and other offerings
for which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we
provide the service or software, or otherwise meet the revenue
recognition criteria.
