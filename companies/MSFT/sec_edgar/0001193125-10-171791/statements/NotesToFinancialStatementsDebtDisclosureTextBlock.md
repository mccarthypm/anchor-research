DEBT

In September 2008, our
Board of Directors authorized debt financings of up to $6.0
billion. As of June 30, 2010, we had $6.0 billion of issued
and outstanding debt comprised of $1.0 billion of commercial paper
and $5.0 billion of long-term debt, including $1.25 billion of
convertible debt. Cash paid for interest on our debt for fiscal
year 2010 was $145 million. No cash was paid for interest on our
debt for fiscal years 2009 and 2008.

Short-term Debt

As of June 30, 2010,
our $1.0 billion of commercial paper issued and outstanding had a
weighted average interest rate, including issuance costs, of 0.20%
and maturities of 22 to 216 days. The estimated fair value of this
commercial paper approximates its carrying value.

In November 2009, we
replaced our $2.0 billion and $1.0 billion credit facilities with a
$2.25 billion 364-day credit facility, which expires on
November 5, 2010. This facility serves as a back-up for our
commercial paper program. In June 2010, we reduced the size of our
credit facility from $2.25 billion to $1.0 billion due to the
reduction in commercial paper outstanding. As of June 30,
2010, we were in compliance with the financial covenant in the
credit facility agreement, which requires a coverage ratio be
maintained of at least three times earnings before interest, taxes,
depreciation, and amortization to interest expense.  No amounts
were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods
presented.

Long-term Debt

Notes

As of June 30, 2010,
we had issued and outstanding $3.75 billion of debt securities as
illustrated in the table below (collectively “the
Notes”). Interest on the Notes is payable semi-annually on
June 1 and December 1 of each year, to holders of record
on the preceding May 15 and November 15.  The Notes
are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other
unsecured and unsubordinated debt outstanding.

Convertible Debt

In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on
June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from
the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses which
were capitalized. The majority of the proceeds were used to repay
outstanding commercial paper, leaving $1.0 billion of commercial
paper outstanding as of June 30, 2010. Each $1,000 principal
amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft
common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share.

Prior to March 15,
2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances,
into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s
common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. On or after
March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any time.
Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate principal
amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of our common
stock or a combination of cash and shares of our common stock, at
our election.

Because the convertible
debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to
separately account for the liability and equity components of the
notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing
rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The
net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18
billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the
portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value
of the option to convert the debt.

In connection with the
issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions
with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of
the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are
expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon
conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we
purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that
in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common
stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the
conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16.
The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded
to stockholders’ equity.

As of June 30, 2010,
the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term
debt, including convertible debt, were $4.94 billion and $5.21
billion, respectively. The estimate of fair value is based on
quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of June 30,
2010, as applicable. The effective interest yields of the Notes due
in 2014, 2019, and 2039 were 3.00%, 4.29%, and 5.22%, respectively,
at June 30, 2010. The effective interest yield of the
convertible debt due in 2013 is 1.85% at June 30, 2010 and the
coupon interest rate is zero percent.

The components of
long-term debt as of June 30, 2010 were as follows:
