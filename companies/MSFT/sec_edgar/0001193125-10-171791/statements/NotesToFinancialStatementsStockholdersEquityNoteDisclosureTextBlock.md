Cumulative Effects of Changes in
Accounting Principle

On July 1, 2007, we
adopted guidance on accounting for uncertainty in income taxes,
which provides a financial statement recognition threshold and
measurement attribute for a tax position taken or expected to be
taken in a tax return. Upon adoption, we recognized a $395 million
charge to our beginning retained deficit as a cumulative effect of
a change in accounting principle.

On July 1, 2007, we
adopted accounting guidance which requires companies to accrue the
costs of compensated absences under a sabbatical or similar benefit
arrangement over the requisite service period. Upon adoption, we
recognized a $17 million charge to our beginning retained deficit
as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting
principle.
