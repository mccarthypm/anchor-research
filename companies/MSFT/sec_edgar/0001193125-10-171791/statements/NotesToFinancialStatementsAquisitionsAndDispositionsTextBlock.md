BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During fiscal year 2010,
we acquired five entities for total consideration of $267 million,
substantially all of which was paid in cash. During this period, we
also sold three entities for total consideration of $600 million,
including Razorfish in the second quarter of fiscal year 2010.
These entities have been included in or removed from our
consolidated results of operations since their acquisition or sale
dates, respectively. Pro forma results of operations have not been
presented because the effects of these business combinations,
individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our
consolidated results of operations.
