reconciling items consist of interest, U. S. state income taxes,
domestic production deductions, and research credits. In fiscal
years 2010, 2009 and 2008, there were no individually significant
other reconciling items.

Deferred income tax
balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the
taxes are actually paid or recovered.

We have not provided
deferred U. S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on
temporary differences of approximately $29.5 billion resulting from
earnings for certain non-U. S. subsidiaries which are permanently
reinvested outside the U. S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability
associated with these temporary differences is approximately $9.2
billion.

Income taxes paid were
$4.1 billion, $6.6 billion, and $5.4 billion in fiscal years 2010,
2009, and 2008, respectively.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

As of June 30, 2010,
we had $6.5 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.6
billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of
June 30, 2009, we had $5.4 billion of unrecognized tax
benefits of which $4.4 billion, if recognized, would affect our
effective tax rate.

Interest on unrecognized
tax benefits was $193 million, $230 million, and $121 million in
fiscal years 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. As of June 30,
2010, 2009 and 2008, we had accrued interest related to uncertain
tax positions of $747 million, $554 million, and $324 million,
respectively, net of federal income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in
the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as
follows:

We are under audit by the
IRS for the tax years 2004-2006.  We do not believe it is
reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12
months as we do not believe the examination will be concluded
within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income
tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S., and certain
jurisdictions are under audit by local tax authorities. The
resolutions of these audits are not expected to be material to our
financial statements.
