EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share
is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per
share is computed based on the weighted average number of shares of
common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common shares
outstanding during the period using the treasury stock method.
Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock options,
stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The components
of basic and diluted earnings per share are as follows:

For fiscal years 2010,
2009, and 2008, 28 million, 342 million, and
91 million shares, respectively, were attributable to
outstanding stock-based awards and were excluded from the
calculation of diluted earnings per share because their inclusion
would have been anti-dilutive.

In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible
into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are
met.  Shares of common stock into which the debt could convert
were excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share
because their inclusion would have been anti-dilutive. See also
