SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the
business, management, including our chief operating decision maker,
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss
statements prepared on a basis not consistent with accounting
principles generally accepted in the U. S. (“ U. S.
GAAP”). Our five segments are Windows & Windows Live
Division; Server and Tools; Online Services Division; Microsoft
Business Division; and Entertainment and Devices Division. We have
recast certain prior period amounts within this note to conform to
the way we internally managed and monitored segment performance
during the current fiscal year, including moving Windows Live from
Online Services Division to Windows & Windows Live
Division and Razorfish from Online Services Division to Corporate.
Razorfish was sold during the second quarter of fiscal year
2010.

Segment revenue and
operating income (loss) were as follows:

The types of products and services
provided by each segment are summarized below:

Due to the integrated
structure of our business, certain costs incurred by one segment
may benefit other segments. The costs that are identifiable are
allocated to the segments that benefit to incent
cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment is not
solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial activity. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and
circumstances of the costs being allocated. These cost allocations
were not material in any period presented.

In addition, certain
costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that
benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs
include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared
facilities services; and customer service and support. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and
circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain other
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments,
including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product
support services; human resources; legal; finance; information
technology; corporate development and procurement activities;
research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and
employee severance.

Assets are not allocated
to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of
amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs
in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable
for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and
depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment
profit or loss.

Reconciling amounts in
the tables above and below include adjustments to conform our
internal accounting policies to U. S. GAAP and corporate-level
activity not specifically attributed to a segment. Significant
internal accounting policies that differ from U. S. GAAP relate to
revenue recognition, income statement classification, depreciation,
and amortization of stock-based awards.

Significant reconciling
items were as follows:
