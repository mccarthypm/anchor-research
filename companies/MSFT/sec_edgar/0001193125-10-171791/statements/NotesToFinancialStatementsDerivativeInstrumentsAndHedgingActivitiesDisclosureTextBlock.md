DERIVATIVES

We use derivative
instruments to manage risks related to foreign currencies, equity
prices, interest rates, and credit; to enhance investment returns;
and to facilitate portfolio diversification. Our objectives for
holding derivatives include reducing, eliminating, and efficiently
managing the economic impact of these exposures as effectively as
possible. Our derivative programs include strategies that both
qualify and do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment. All
notional amounts presented below are measured in U. S. currency
equivalents.

Foreign Currency

Certain forecasted
transactions, assets, and liabilities are exposed to foreign
currency risk. We monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to
maximize the economic effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge
positions. Option and forward contracts are used to hedge a portion
of forecasted international revenue for up to three years in the
future and are designated as cash-flow hedging instruments.
Principal currencies hedged include the euro, Japanese yen, British
pound, and Canadian dollar. As of June 30, 2010 and 2009, the
total notional amounts of these foreign exchange contracts sold
were $9.3 billion and $7.2 billion, respectively.  Foreign
currency risks related to certain non-U. S. dollar denominated
securities are hedged using foreign exchange forward contracts that
are designated as fair-value hedging instruments. As of
June 30, 2010 and 2009, the total notional amounts of these
foreign exchange contracts sold were $523 million and $3.5 billion,
respectively.  Certain options and forwards not designated as
hedging instruments are also used to manage the variability in
exchange rates on accounts receivable, cash, and intercompany
positions, and to manage other foreign currency exposures.  As
of June 30, 2010, the total notional amounts of these foreign
exchange contracts purchased and sold were $7.8 billion and $5.3
billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional
amounts of these foreign exchange contracts purchased and sold were
$3.2 billion and $3.6 billion, respectively.

Equity

Securities held in our
equity and other investments portfolio are subject to market price
risk.  Market price risk is managed relative to broad-based
global and domestic equity indices using certain convertible
preferred investments, options, futures, and swap contracts not
designated as hedging instruments. From time to time, to hedge our
price risk, we may use and designate equity derivatives as hedging
instruments, including puts, calls, swaps, and forwards.  As of
June 30, 2010, the total notional amounts of designated and
non-designated equity contracts purchased and sold were $918
million and $472 million, respectively. As of June 30, 2009,
the total notional amounts of designated and non-designated equity
contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.

Interest Rate

Securities held in our
fixed-income portfolio are subject to different interest rate risks
based on their maturities. We manage the average maturity of our
fixed-income portfolio to achieve economic returns that correlate
to certain broad-based fixed-income indices using exchange-traded
option and futures contracts and over-the-counter swap and option
contracts, none of which are designated as hedging instruments. As
of June 30, 2010, the total notional amounts of fixed-interest
rate contracts purchased and sold were $3.1 billion and $1.8
billion, respectively. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional
amounts of fixed-interest rate contracts purchased and sold were
$2.7 billion and $456 million, respectively. In addition, we use
“ To Be Announced” forward purchase commitments of
mortgage-backed assets to gain exposure to agency mortgage-backed
securities.  These meet the definition of a derivative
instrument in cases where physical delivery of the assets is not
taken at the earliest available delivery date. As of June 30,
2010 and 2009, the total notional derivative amount of mortgage
contracts purchased were immaterial and $1.3 billion,
respectively.

Credit

Our fixed-income
portfolio is diversified and consists primarily of investment-grade
securities. We use credit default swap contracts, not designated as
hedging instruments, to manage credit exposures relative to
broad-based indices and to facilitate portfolio diversification. We
use credit default swaps as they are a low cost method of managing
exposure to individual credit risks or groups of credit risks. As
of June 30, 2010 and 2009, the total notional amounts of
credit contracts purchased and sold were immaterial.

Commodity

We use broad-based
commodity exposures to enhance portfolio returns and to facilitate
portfolio diversification. We use swap, futures and option
contracts, not designated as hedging instruments, to generate and
manage exposures to broad-based commodity indices. We use
derivatives on commodities as they can be low-cost alternatives to
the purchase and storage of a variety of commodities, including,
but not limited to, precious metals, energy, and grain. As of
June 30, 2010, the total notional amounts of commodity
contracts purchased and sold were $1.1 billion and $376 million,
respectively. As of June 30, 2009, the total notional amounts
of commodity contracts purchased and sold were $543 million and $33
million, respectively.

Credit-Risk-Related Contingent
Features

Certain of our
counterparty agreements for derivative instruments contain
provisions that require our issued and outstanding long-term
unsecured debt to maintain an investment grade credit rating and
require us to maintain a minimum liquidity of $1.0 billion. To the
extent we fail to meet these requirements, we will be required to
post collateral, similar to the standard convention related to
over-the-counter derivatives. As of June 30, 2010, our
long-term unsecured debt rating was AAA, and cash investments were
in excess of $1.0 billion. As a result, no collateral is required
to be posted.

Fair Values of Derivative
Instruments

Following are the gross
fair values of derivative instruments held at June 30, 2010
and 2009, excluding the impact of netting derivative assets and
liabilities when a legally enforceable master netting agreement
exists and fair value adjustments related to our own credit risk
and counterparty credit risk:

Fair-Value Hedges

We recognized in other

designated as fair value hedges and their related hedged

Cash-Flow Hedges

We recognized the
following gains (losses) related to foreign exchange contracts
designated as cash flow hedges (our only cash flow hedges during
the period):

We estimate that $496
million of net derivative gains included in OCI will be
reclassified into earnings within the next 12 months. No
significant amounts of gains (losses) were reclassified from OCI
into earnings as a result of forecasted transactions that failed to
occur during fiscal year 2010.

Non-Designated
Derivatives

Gains (losses) from
changes in fair values of derivatives that are not designated as
hedges are primarily recognized in other income (expense). These
amounts are shown in the table below, with the exception of gains
(losses) on derivatives presented in income statement line items
other than other income (expense), which were immaterial for the
fiscal years 2010 and 2009. Other than those derivatives entered
into for investment purposes, such as commodity contracts, the
gains (losses) below are generally economically offset by
unrealized gains (losses) in the underlying available-for-sale
securities.
