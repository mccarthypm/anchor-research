CONTINGENCIES

Government Competition Law
Matters

In March 2004, the
European Commission issued a competition law decision that, among
other things, ordered us to license certain Windows server protocol
technology to our competitors. In March 2007, the European
Commission issued a statement of objections claiming that the
pricing terms we proposed for licensing the technology as required
by the March 2004 decision were “not reasonable.”
Following additional steps we took to address these concerns, the
Commission announced on October 22, 2007 that we were in
compliance with the March 2004 decision and that no further penalty
should accrue after that date. On February 27, 2008, the
Commission issued a fine of $1.4 billion ( € €

In January 2008, the
Commission opened a competition law investigation that relates
primarily to interoperability with respect to our Microsoft Office
family of products. This investigation resulted from complaints
filed with the Commission by a trade association of
Microsoft’s competitors. Microsoft has made a number of
proposals to address the Commission’s competition law
concerns in this area. The Commission announced on
December 16, 2009 that it welcomed these proposals and that it
will take them into account in assessing this matter. During the
fourth quarter of fiscal year 2010, the trade association withdrew
its complaint that was the basis of the investigation.

We are also subject to a
Consent Decree and Final Judgment (“ Final Judgments”)
that resolved lawsuits brought by the U. S. Department of Justice,
18 states, and the District of Columbia in two separate actions.
The Final Judgments imposed various constraints on our Windows
operating system businesses. The Final Judgments are scheduled to
expire in May 2011.

In other ongoing
investigations, various foreign governments and several state
attorneys general have requested information from us concerning
competition, privacy, and security issues.

Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and
Overcharge Class Actions

A large number of
antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed
against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf
of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC
operating system and certain other software products. We obtained
dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal
law and in 15 states. Courts refused to certify classes in two
additional states. We have reached agreements to settle all claims
that have been made to date in 19 states and the District of
Columbia.

The settlements in all
states have received final court approval. Under the settlements,
generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be
reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral
computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we
may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain
schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or
claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). The total
value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of
class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum
value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The
actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum
amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that
are issued and redeem vouchers. We estimate the total cost to
resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range
between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. At June 30, 2010, we
have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately
$651 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion
less payments made to date of approximately $1.2 billion mostly for
vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.

The three cases pending
in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been
settled. In March 2010, the court in the British Columbia case
certified it as a class action. We have appealed this ruling. The
other two actions have been stayed.

Other Antitrust Litigation and
Claims

In November 2004, Novell,
Inc. filed a complaint in U. S. District Court for the District of
Utah (later transferred to federal court in Maryland), asserting
antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to
Novell’s ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity
applications during the period between June 1994 and March 1996. In
June 2005, the trial court granted our motion to dismiss four of
six claims of the complaint. On March 30, 2010, the trial
court granted summary judgment in favor of Microsoft as to all
remaining claims. Novell has appealed that ruling.

Patent and Intellectual Property
Claims

In 2003, we filed an
action in U. S. District Court in California seeking a declaratory
judgment that we do not infringe certain Alcatel-Lucent patents
(although this action began before the merger of Alcatel and Lucent
in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of
Alcatel-Lucent). In April 2008, a jury returned a verdict in
Alcatel-Lucent’s favor in a trial on a consolidated group of
one video and three user interface patents. The jury concluded that
we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded $367
million in damages. In June 2008, the trial judge increased the
amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of
interest. We appealed that award to the Federal Circuit. In
December 2008, we entered into a settlement agreement resolving all
other litigation pending between Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent,
leaving approximately $500 million remaining in dispute. In
September 2009, the United States Court of Appeals for the
Federal Circuit affirmed the liability award but vacated the
verdict and remanded the case to the trial court for a re-trial of
the damages ruling, indicating the damages previously awarded were
too high. Trial on the remanded damages claim has been set for the
first week of December 2010.

In October 2003, Uniloc
USA Inc., a subsidiary of a Singapore-based security technology
company, filed a patent infringement suit in U. S. District Court in
Rhode Island, claiming that product activation technology in
Windows XP and certain other Microsoft programs violated a Uniloc
patent. After we obtained a favorable summary judgment that we did
not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the court of appeals
vacated the trial court decision and remanded the case for trial.
In April 2009, the jury returned a $388 million verdict against us,
including a finding of willful infringement. In
September 2009, the district court judge overturned the jury
verdict, ruling that the evidence did not support the jury’s
finding that Microsoft infringed the patent. Uniloc has
appealed.

In March 2007, i4i
Limited Partnership sued Microsoft in U. S. District Court in Texas
claiming that certain custom XML technology in Word 2003 and 2007
infringed i4i’s patent. In May 2009, a jury returned a
verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million and that we
willfully infringed the patent. In August 2009, the court denied
our post-trial motions and awarded enhanced damages of $40 million
and prejudgment interest of $37 million. The court also issued
a permanent injunction prohibiting additional distribution of the
allegedly infringing technology. We appealed and the appellate
court stayed the injunction pending our appeal. On
December 22, 2009, the court of appeals rejected our appeal
and affirmed the trial court’s judgment and injunction,
except that the court of appeals modified the effective date of the
injunction to January 11, 2010. On April 1, 2010, the
court of appeals denied our request for a rehearing. We intend to
seek review by the U. S. Supreme Court.

In 2007, VirnetX Inc.
brought suit in U. S. District Court in Texas claiming that various
Microsoft products including Windows client and server operating
systems software and communications software infringe two patents
related to technology for securely communicating over the
Internet.  This case was tried by a jury in March
2010.  The jury returned a verdict that Microsoft willfully
infringed both patents, and found damages of approximately
$106 million.  In March 2010, VirnetX filed a new lawsuit
in the Eastern District of Texas alleging that additional Microsoft
products and services including Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008
R2 infringe the same two patents. The parties have reached an
agreement to settle both lawsuits.

There are over 50 other
patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft, 10 of which
are set for trial in fiscal year 2010.

Other

We also are subject to a
variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in
the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in
aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial
statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
management’s view of these matters may change in the
future.

As of June 30, 2010,
we had accrued aggregate liabilities of approximately $1.0 billion
in other current liabilities and approximately $236 million in
other long-term liabilities for all of the contingent matters
described in this note. While we intend to vigorously defend these
matters, there exists the possibility of adverse outcomes that we
estimate could reach approximately $800 million in aggregate beyond
recorded amounts. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our
financial statements for the period in which the effects become
reasonably estimable.
