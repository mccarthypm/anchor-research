| **      Generally Accepted Accounting Principles Policy** | Accounting
Principles

The financial statements
and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.
 |
| **      Consolidation, Policy** | Principles of
Consolidation

The financial statements
include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity
investments through which we exercise significant influence over
but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary
of the investee’s activities are accounted for using the
equity method. Investments through which we are not able to
exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not
have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the
cost method.
 |
| **      Estimates And Assumptions, Policy** | Estimates and
Assumptions

Preparing financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses. Examples include: estimates of loss contingencies,
product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and
stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the
elements comprising a software arrangement, including the
distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when
technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the
potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns;
estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our
reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are
other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from
management’s estimates and assumptions.
 |
| **      Foreign Currency Transactions and Translations Policy** | Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities
recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate
on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to Other
Comprehensive Income (“ OCI”).
 |
| **      Revenue Recognition, Policy** | Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
probable.

Revenue for retail
packaged products, products licensed to original equipment
manufacturers (“ OEMs”), and perpetual licenses under
certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as
products are shipped or made available. A portion of the revenue
related to Windows XP is deferred due to the right to receive
unspecified upgrades/enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on
a when-and-if-available basis. The amount of revenue allocated to
the unspecified upgrade/enhancement rights for Microsoft Internet
Explorer is based on the vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value for those elements using the residual method or relative fair
value method and the deferred revenue is recognized ratably on a
straight-line basis over the Windows XP life cycle. Revenue related
to Windows Vista and Windows 7 is not subject to a similar deferral
because there are no significant undelivered elements. Revenue for
products under the technology guarantee programs, which provide
free or significantly discounted rights to use upcoming new
versions of a software product if an end user licenses existing
versions of the product during the eligibility period, is allocated
between existing product and the new product, and revenue allocated
to the new product is deferred until that version is delivered. The
revenue allocation is based on vendor-specific objective evidence
of fair value of both products.

Certain multi-year
licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current
products combined with rights to receive future versions of
software products on a when-and-if-available basis (“ Software
Assurance”) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with
billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue
ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain
arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a
period of time without taking possession of software are also
accounted for as subscriptions.

Revenue related to our
Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, games published by us,
and other hardware components is generally recognized when
ownership is transferred to the retailers. Revenue related to games
published by third parties for use on the Xbox 360 platform is
recognized when games are manufactured by the game publishers.
Display advertising revenue is recognized as advertisements are
displayed. Search advertising revenue is recognized when the ad
appears in the search results or when the action necessary to earn
the revenue has been completed. Consulting services revenue is
recognized as services are rendered, generally based on the
negotiated hourly rate in the consulting arrangement and the number
of hours worked during the period. Consulting revenue for
fixed-price services arrangements is recognized as services are
provided.

Revenue generally is
recognized net of any taxes collected from customers and
subsequently remitted to governmental authorities.
 |
| **      Cost of Sales, Policy** | Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes;
manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs
licensed; operating costs related to product support service
centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include
software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our Web sites and
to acquire online advertising space (“traffic acquisition
costs”); costs incurred to support and maintain
Internet-based products and services; warranty costs; inventory
valuation adjustments; costs associated with the delivery of
consulting services; and the amortization of capitalized research
and development costs. Capitalized research and development costs
are amortized over the estimated lives of the products.
 |
| **      Product Warranty, Policy** | Product Warranty

We provide for the
estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and
software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical
and projected product failure rates, historical and projected
repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any).
The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending
upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but
generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging
from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we
estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches,
over the estimated life of the software.
 |
| **      Research, Development, and Computer Software, Policy** | Research and
Development

Research and development
expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with product development. Research and development
expenses also include third-party development and programming
costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for
international markets, and the amortization of purchased software
code and services content. Such costs related to software
development are included in research and development expense until
the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our
software products, is generally shortly before the products are
released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of
revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
 |
| **      Selling And Marketing, Policy** | Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing
expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation, and other headcount-related expenses associated with
sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of advertising,
promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs. Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $1.6
billion, $1.4 billion, and $1.2 billion in fiscal years 2010, 2009,
and 2008, respectively.
 |
| **      Costs Associated with Exit or Disposal Activities or Restructurings, Policy** | Employee Severance

We record employee
severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the
plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that
significant changes will be made to the plan.
 |
| **      Share based Compensation, Policy** | Stock-Based
Compensation

We measure stock-based
compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the
award and recognize it as expense over the applicable vesting
period of the stock award (generally four to five years) using the
straight-line method.
 |
| **      Employee Stock Purchase Plan, Policy** | Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

Shares of our common
stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90%
of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each
three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock
purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled
to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of
purchase.
 |
| **      Income Tax, Policy** | Income Taxes

Income tax expense
includes U. S. and international income taxes, the provision for
U. S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries
not deemed to be permanently invested and interest and penalties on
uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not
reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year.
The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as
deferred income taxes.
 |
| **      Fair Value Measurements And Disclosures Policy** | Fair Value
Measurements

We account for certain
assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists
three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used
in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  We
categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these
three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels
are:

  Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted               

  Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for                    

  Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and                      

We measure certain
assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these
investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the
best information available, and may include quoted market prices,
market comparables, and discounted cash flow
projections.

Our current financial
liabilities, including our short-term debt, have fair values that
approximate their carrying values. Our long-term financial
liabilities consist of long-term debt which is recorded on the
balance sheet at issuance price less unamortized
discount.
 |
| **      Financial Instruments Policy** | Financial
Instruments

We consider all highly
liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months
or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In
general, investments with original maturities of greater than three
months and remaining maturities of less than one year are
classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities
beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their
highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities
represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI.

Equity and other
investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity
instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments
that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly
traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.

We lend certain
fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our
balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as
collateral for the loan securities with the amount determined based
upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the
borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a
corresponding liability.

Investments are
considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to
be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly
available market information or other estimates determined by
management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis
that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in
evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of
an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt
instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value
is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and
ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed income
securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the
security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to
sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific
adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business
outlook for the investee, including industry and sector
performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing
cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be
other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other
income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is
established.

Derivative instruments
are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at
fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the
resulting designation.

For a derivative
instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain (loss) is
recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the
offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk
being hedged. For options designated as fair-value hedges, changes
in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.

For derivative
instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion
of the derivative’s gain (loss) is initially reported as a
component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when
the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options
designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are
recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing
either hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
earnings.

For derivative
instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from
changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
(expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment
purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are
generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the
underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a
component of OCI until the securities are sold or
other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are
moved from OCI into other income (expense).
 |
| **      Allowance For Doubtful Accounts, Policy** | Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The allowance for
doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses
inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the
allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience,
and other currently available evidence.
 |
| **      Allowance for Doubtful Accounts** | Activity in the allowance
for doubtful accounts was as follows:

| **      Inventory, Policy** | Inventories

Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost
includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to
the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review
inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our
suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our
review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we
reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost
of revenue.
 |
| **      Property, Plant and Equipment, Policy** | Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment is
stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease
term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are
generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for
internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years;
buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold
improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to
five years. Land is not depreciated.
 |
| **      Goodwill, Policy** | Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for
impairment using a fair-value-based approach on an annual basis
(May 1 for us) and between annual tests if indicators of potential
impairment exist.
 |
| **      Intangible Assets, Policy** | Intangible Assets

All of our intangible
assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit,
ranging from one to 10 years. We evaluate the recoverability of
intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or
circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or
that indicate the asset may be impaired.
 |
| **      Schedule of New Accounting Pronouncements and Changes in Accounting Principles** | Recently Issued Accounting
Standards

Recently Adopted Accounting
Pronouncements

In January 2010, the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) issued
guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to recurring
and nonrecurring fair value measurements.  The guidance
requires new disclosures on the transfers of assets and liabilities
between Level 1 (quoted prices in active market for identical
assets or liabilities) and Level 2 (significant other observable
inputs) of the fair value measurement hierarchy, including the
reasons and the timing of the transfers.  Additionally, the
guidance requires a roll forward of activities on purchases, sales,
issuance, and settlements of the assets and liabilities measured
using significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value
measurements). The guidance became effective for us with the
reporting period beginning January 1, 2010, except for the
disclosure on the roll forward activities for Level 3 fair value
measurements, which will become effective for us with the reporting
period beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional
disclosures, adoption of this new guidance did not have a material
impact on our financial statements. See Note 6 - Fair Value
Measurements.

On July 1, 2009, we
adopted guidance issued by the FASB on business combinations. The
guidance retains the fundamental requirements that the acquisition
method of accounting (previously referred to as the purchase method
of accounting) be used for all business combinations, but requires
a number of changes, including changes in the way assets and
liabilities are recognized and measured as a result of business
combinations. It also requires the capitalization of in-process
research and development at fair value and requires the expensing
of acquisition-related costs as incurred. We have applied this
guidance to business combinations completed since July 1,
2009.

On July 1, 2009, we
adopted guidance issued by the FASB that changes the accounting and
reporting for non-controlling interests. Non-controlling interests
are to be reported as a component of equity separate from the
parent’s equity, and purchases or sales of equity interests
that do not result in a change in control are to be accounted for
as equity transactions. In addition, net income attributable to a
non-controlling interest is to be included in net income and, upon
a loss of control, the interest sold, as well as any interest
retained, is to be recorded at fair value with any gain or loss
recognized in net income. Adoption of the new guidance did not have
a material impact on our financial statements.

On July 1, 2009, we
adopted guidance on fair value measurement for nonfinancial assets
and liabilities, except for items that are recognized or disclosed
at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis (at
least annually). Adoption of the new guidance did not have a
material impact on our financial statements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements
Not Yet Adopted

In October 2009, the FASB
issued guidance on revenue recognition that will become effective
for us beginning July 1, 2010. Under the new guidance on
arrangements that include software elements, tangible products that
have software components that are essential to the functionality of
the tangible product will no longer be within the scope of the
software revenue recognition guidance, and software-enabled
products will now be subject to other relevant revenue recognition
guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on revenue
arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside the scope
of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the new
guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third party
evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be determined, a
best estimate of the selling price is required to separate
deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using the
relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new
disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative
selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue
recognition. We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have
a material impact on our financial statements.

In June 2009, the FASB
issued guidance on the consolidation of variable interest entities,
which is effective for us beginning July 1, 2010. The new
guidance requires revised evaluations of whether entities represent
variable interest entities, ongoing assessments of control over
such entities, and additional disclosures for variable interests.
We believe adoption of this new guidance will not have a material
impact on our financial statements.
