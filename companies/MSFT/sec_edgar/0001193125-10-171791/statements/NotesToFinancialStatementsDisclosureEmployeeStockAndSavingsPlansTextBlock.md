Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

We have an employee stock
purchase plan for all eligible employees. Shares of our common
stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90%
of the fair market value on the last day of each three-month
period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not exceeding
15% of their gross compensation during an offering period.
Employees purchased the following shares during the periods
presented:

At June 30, 2010,
64 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future
issuance through the employee stock purchase plan.

Stock Plans

We have stock plans for
directors and for officers, employees, consultants, and advisors.
At June 30, 2010, an aggregate of 690 million shares were
authorized for future grant under our stock plans, which cover
stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards.
Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares
generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue
new shares to satisfy exercises and vestings of awards granted
under all of our stock plans.

Stock Awards

Stock awards
(“ SAs”) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of
Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Our SAs generally vest
over a five-year period.

Shared Performance Stock
Awards

Shared performance stock
awards (“ SPSAs”) are a form of SA in which the number
of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance
against specified performance targets.

We granted SPSAs for
fiscal years 2010, 2009, and 2008 with performance periods of
July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010,  July 1,
2008 through June 30, 2009, and July 1, 2007 through
June 30, 2008, respectively. In September following the end of
each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to
the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a
percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. The percentage is based on
performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole
discretion. An additional number of shares, approximately 12% of
the total target SPSAs, are available as additional awards to
participants based on individual performance. One-quarter of the
shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the
performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares
vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant
date.

Executive Officer Incentive
Plan

In fiscal year 2009, the
Compensation Committee approved a new Executive Officer Incentive
Plan (“ EOIP”) for executive officers of the
Company.  The EOIP replaced the annual cash bonus opportunity
and equity award plans for executive officers.  Under the EOIP,
the Compensation Committee makes awards of performance-based
compensation for specified performance periods.  For fiscal
years 2010 and 2009, executive officers were eligible to receive
annual awards comprised of cash and SAs from an incentive pool
equal to a percentage of the Company’s operating income. For
fiscal year 2010 it was 0.45% of operating income, and for fiscal
year 2009 it was 0.35% of operating income. Following approval of
the awards, 20% of the award is payable to the executive officers
in cash, and the remaining 80% is converted into an SA for shares
of Microsoft common stock. The SA portion of the award vests
one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following
fiscal year-end, and one-quarter on August 31 of each of
the following three years.

We grant awards from the
incentive pool to the executive officers in September following the
end of the fiscal year based on the officer’s performance
during the prior fiscal year period. Each executive officer
receives a fixed percentage of the pool ranging between 0% and 150%
of a target based on an assessment of the executive officer’s
performance during the fiscal year. The number of shares subject to
the SA portion of the award is determined by dividing the value of
the award by the closing price of Microsoft common stock on
August 31 of each year.

Activity for All Stock
Plans

The fair value of each
award is estimated on the date of grant using the following
assumptions:

  Year Ended June 30,                 2010             2009                 2008

Stock Options

In fiscal year 2004, we
began granting employees and non-employee directors SAs rather than
non-qualified and incentive stock options as part of our equity
compensation plans. Since then, stock options issued to employees
have been issued primarily in conjunction with business
acquisitions. Options granted between 1995 and 2001 generally vest
over four and one-half years and expire seven years from the date
of grant, while certain options vest either over four and one-half
years or over seven and one-half years and expire 10 years from the
date of grant. Options granted after 2001 vest over four and
one-half years and expire 10 years from the date of grant. We
granted one million, one million, and 10 million stock
options in conjunction with business acquisitions during fiscal
years 2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively.

Savings Plan

We have a savings plan in
the United States that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in
international locations. Participating U. S. employees may
contribute up to 50% of their salary, but not more than statutory
limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant
contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a
participant’s earnings. Matching contributions for all plans
were $275 million, $262 million, and $238 million in fiscal years
2010, 2009, and 2008, respectively, and were expensed as
contributed. Matching contributions are invested proportionate to
each participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment
options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U. S.
plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor
our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft
common stock.
