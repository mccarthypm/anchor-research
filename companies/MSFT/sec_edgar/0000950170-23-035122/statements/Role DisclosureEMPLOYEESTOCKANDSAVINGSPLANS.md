We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. Awards that expire
or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become available for

satisfy vesting of awards granted under our stock plans. We also have an ESPP 
for all eligible employees.

Stock Plans

Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as 
the award vests. Stock awards generally vest over a service period of four years
or five years.

Executive Incentive Plan

Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock 
awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest 
ratably over a service period of four years. PSUs generally vest over a

is based on the extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been 
achieved.
