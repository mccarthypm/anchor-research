U. S. Cell Phone Litigation

Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset 
manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 46 lawsuits, including 45
lawsuits filed in the Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual 
plaintiffs who allege that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their 
brain tumors and other adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for 
these claims in our agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business 
and have been substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were 
filed in 2002 and are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the 
remaining cases are stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals 
for the District of Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from
the use of cellular handsets that operate within the U. S. Federal 
Communications Commission radio frequency emission guidelines (“FCC Guidelines”)
are pre-empted by federal law. The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either 
operated outside the FCC Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC 
Guidelines went into effect. The lawsuits also allege an industry-wide 
conspiracy to manipulate the science and testing around emission guidelines.

In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the 
plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed 
scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in
part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation 
experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal to the District of 
Columbia Court of Appeals challenging the standard for evaluating expert 
scientific evidence. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its decision 
adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the cases to the
trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The plaintiffs have 
filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which were stricken by the 
court. A hearing on general causation took place in September of 2022. In April 
of 2023, the court granted defendants’ motion to strike the testimony of 
plaintiffs’ experts that cell phones cause brain cancer and entered an order 
excluding all of plaintiffs’ experts from testifying.

Irish Data Protection Commission Matter

In 2018, the Irish Data Protection Commission (“IDPC”) began investigating a 
complaint against LinkedIn as to whether LinkedIn’s targeted advertising 
practices violated the recently implemented European Union General Data 
Protection Regulation (“GDPR”). Microsoft cooperated throughout the period of 
inquiry. In April 2023, the IDPC provided LinkedIn with a non-public preliminary
draft decision alleging GDPR violations and proposing a fine. Microsoft intends 
to challenge the preliminary draft decision. There is no set timeline for the 
IDPC to issue a final decision.

Other Contingencies

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time 
to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently 
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of 
these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2023, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $617 million. 
While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we 
estimate could reach approximately $600 million in aggregate beyond recorded 
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated 
financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably 
estimable.
