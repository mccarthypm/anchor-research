| **  SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA** | NOTE 19 - SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the business, management, including our chief operating 
decision maker, who is also our Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain 
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss statements 
prepared on a basis not consistent with GAAP. During the periods presented, we 
reported our financial performance based on the following segments: Productivity
and Business Processes, Intelligent Cloud, and More Personal Computing.

We have recast certain prior period amounts to conform to the way we internally 
manage and monitor our business.

Our reportable segments are described below.

Productivity and Business Processes

Our Productivity and Business Processes segment consists of products and 
services in our portfolio of productivity, communication, and information 
services, spanning a variety of devices and platforms. This segment primarily 
comprises:

• Office Commercial (Office 365 subscriptions, the Office 365 portion of 
Microsoft 365 Commercial subscriptions, and Office licensed on-premises), 
comprising Office, Exchange, SharePoint, Microsoft Teams, Office 365 Security 
and Compliance, Microsoft Viva, and Microsoft 365 Copilot.

• Office Consumer, including Microsoft 365 Consumer subscriptions, Office 
licensed on-premises, and other Office services.

• LinkedIn, including Talent Solutions, Marketing Solutions, Premium 
Subscriptions, and Sales Solutions.

• Dynamics business solutions, including Dynamics 365, comprising a set of 
intelligent, cloud-based applications across ERP, CRM (including Customer 
Insights), Power Apps, and Power Automate; and on-premises ERP and CRM 
applications.

Intelligent Cloud

Our Intelligent Cloud segment consists of our public, private, and hybrid server
products and cloud services that can power modern business and developers. This 
segment primarily comprises:

• Server products and cloud services, including Azure and other cloud services; 
SQL Server, Windows Server, Visual Studio, System Center, and related Client 
Access Licenses (“CALs”); and Nuance and GitHub.

• Enterprise Services, including Enterprise Support Services, Industry Solutions
(formerly Microsoft Consulting Services), and Nuance professional services.

More Personal Computing

Our More Personal Computing segment consists of products and services that put 
customers at the center of the experience with our technology. This segment 
primarily comprises:

• Windows, including Windows OEM licensing and other non-volume licensing of the
Windows operating system; Windows Commercial, comprising volume licensing of the
Windows operating system, Windows cloud services, and other Windows commercial 
offerings; patent licensing; and Windows Internet of Things.

• Devices, including Surface, HoloLens, and PC accessories.

• Gaming, including Xbox hardware and Xbox content and services, comprising 
first- and third-party content (including games and in-game content), Xbox Game 
Pass and other subscriptions, Xbox Cloud Gaming, advertising, third-party disc 
royalties, and other cloud services.

• Search and news advertising, comprising Bing (including Bing Chat), Microsoft 
News, Microsoft Edge, and third-party affiliates.

Revenue and costs are generally directly attributed to our segments. However, 
due to the integrated structure of our business, certain revenue recognized and 
costs incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue from certain 
contracts is allocated among the segments based on the relative value of the 
underlying products and services, which can include allocation based on actual 
prices charged, prices when sold separately, or estimated costs plus a profit 
margin. Cost of revenue is allocated in certain cases based on a relative 
revenue methodology. Operating expenses that are allocated primarily include 
those relating to marketing of products and services from which multiple 
segments benefit and are generally allocated based on relative gross margin.

In addition, certain costs are incurred at a corporate level and allocated to 
our segments. These allocated costs generally include legal, including 
settlements and fines, information technology, human resources, finance, excise 
taxes, field selling, shared facilities services, customer service and support, 
and severance incurred as part of a corporate program. Each allocation is 
measured differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the costs 
being allocated and is generally based on relative gross margin or relative 
headcount.

Segment revenue and operating income were as follows during the periods 
presented:

Our Microsoft Cloud revenue, which includes Azure and other cloud services,

Assets are not allocated to segments for internal reporting presentations. A 
portion of amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs in
an overhead allocation to each segment. It is impracticable for us to separately
identify the amount of amortization and depreciation by segment that is included
in the measure of segment profit or loss.

the location of the controlling statutory company and with countries over 10% of
the total shown separately, were as follows:
