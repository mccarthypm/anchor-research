Effective Tax Rate

The items accounting for the difference between income taxes computed at the U. 
S. federal statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:

In the first quarter of fiscal year 2022, we transferred certain intangible 
properties from our Puerto Rico subsidiary to the U. S. The transfer of 
intangible properties resulted in a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2022, as the value of future U. S. tax deductions 
exceeded the current tax liability from the U. S. global intangible low-taxed 
income (“GILTI”) tax.

We have historically paid India withholding taxes on software sales through 
distributor withholding and tax audit assessments in India. In March 2021, the 
India Supreme Court ruled favorably in the case of Engineering Analysis Centre 
of Excellence Private Limited vs The Commissioner of Income Tax for companies in
86 separate appeals, some dating back to 2012, holding that software sales are 
not subject to India withholding taxes. Although we were not a party to the 
appeals, our software sales in India were determined to be not subject to 
withholding taxes. Therefore, we recorded a net income tax benefit of $620 
million in the third quarter of fiscal year 2021 to reflect the results of the 
India Supreme Court decision impacting fiscal year1996 through fiscal year2016.

The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2023 is primarily 
due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from 
producing and distributing our products and services through our foreign 
regional operations center in Ireland. The decrease from the federal statutory 
rate in fiscal year 2022 is primarily due to the net income tax benefit related 
to the transfer of intangible properties, earnings taxed at lower rates in 
foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our products and
services through our foreign regional operations center in Ireland, and tax 
benefits relating to stock-based compensation. The decrease from the federal 
statutory rate in fiscal year 2021 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower 
rates in foreign jurisdictions resulting from producing and distributing our 
products and services through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland
and Puerto Rico, tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation, and tax 
benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes. In fiscal 
year 2023, our foreign regional operating center in Ireland, which is taxed at a
rate lower than the U. S. rate, generated81% of our foreign income before tax. 
In fiscal years 2022 and 2021, our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland
and Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, 
generated71% and82% of our foreign income before tax. Other reconciling items, 
net consists primarily of tax credits and GILTI tax, and in fiscal year 2021, 
includes tax benefits from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding 
taxes. In fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, there were no individually 
significant other reconciling items.

The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2023 compared to fiscal 
year 2022 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible 
properties and a decrease in tax benefits relating to stock-based compensation. 
The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2022 compared to fiscal 
year 2021 was primarily due to a $3.3 billion net income tax benefit in the 
first quarter of fiscal year 2022 related to the transfer of intangible 
properties, offset in part by changes in the mix of our income before income 
taxes between the U. S. and foreign countries, as well as tax benefits in the 
prior year from the India Supreme Court decision on withholding taxes, an 
agreement between the U. S. and India tax authorities related to transfer 
pricing, and final Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) regulations.

(a)

Provisions enacted in the TCJA related to the capitalization for tax purposes of
research and development expenditures became effective on July 1, 2022. These 
provisions require us to capitalize research and development expenditures and 
amortize them on our U. S. tax return over five or fifteen years, depending on 
where research is conducted.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

As of June 30, 2023, we had federal, state, and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $509 million, $1.2 billion, and $2.3 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards have varying expiration dates
ranging from fiscal year2024 to2043 or indefinite carryforward periods, if not 
utilized. The majority of our foreign net operating loss carryforwards do not 
expire. Certain acquired net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an 
annual limitation but are expected to be realized with the exception of those 
which have a valuation allowance. As of June 30, 2023, we had $456 million 
federal capital loss carryforwards for U. S. tax purposes from our acquisition 
of Nuance. The federal capital loss carryforwards are subject to an annual 
limitation and will expire in fiscal year2025.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards, federal capital loss carryforwards, and other net 
deferred tax assets that may not be realized.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $23.1 billion, $16.0 billion, and $13.4 
billion in fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Gross unrecognized tax benefits related to uncertain tax positions as of June 
30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, were $17.1 billion, $15.6 billion, and $14.6 billion, 
respectively, which were primarily included in long-term income taxes in our 
consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, the resulting tax benefit would 
affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 by $14.4 
billion, $13.3 billion, and $12.5 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $5.2 billion, $4.3 billion, and $4.3 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. The provision for income taxes for 
fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021 included interest expense related to uncertain
tax positions of $918 million, $36 million, and $274 million, respectively, net 
of income tax benefits.

The aggregate changes in the gross unrecognized tax benefits related to 
uncertain tax positions were as follows:

We settled a portion of the Internal Revenue Service (“IRS”) audit for tax 
years2004 to2006 in fiscal year 2011. In February 2012, the IRS withdrew its 
2011 Revenue Agents Report related to unresolved issues for tax years 2004 to 
2006 and reopened the audit phase of the examination. We also settled a portion 
of the IRS audit for tax years2007 to2009 in fiscal year 2016, and a portion of 
the IRS audit for tax years2010 to2013 in fiscal year 2018. In the second 
quarter of fiscal year 2021, we settled an additional portion of the IRS audits 
for tax years2004 to2013 and made a payment of $1.7 billion, including tax and 
interest. We remain under audit for tax years2004 to2017.

As of June 30, 2023, the primary unresolved issues for the IRS audits relate to 
transfer pricing, which could have a material impact in our consolidated 
financial statements when the matters are resolved. We believe our allowances 
for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a proposed 
assessment for the unresolved key transfer pricing issues. We do not expect a 
final resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to 
our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax 
years1996 to2022, some of which are currently under audit by local tax 
authorities. The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be 
material to our consolidated financial statements.
