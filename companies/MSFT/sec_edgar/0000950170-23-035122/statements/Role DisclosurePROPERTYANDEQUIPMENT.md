During fiscal years 2023, 2022, and 2021, depreciation expense was $11.0 
billion, $12.6 billion, and $9.3 billion, respectively. Depreciation expense 
declined in fiscal year 2023 due to the change in estimated useful lives of our 
server and network equipment.

As of June 30, 2023, we have committed $13.5 billion for the construction of new
buildings, building improvements, and leasehold improvements, primarily related 
to datacenters.
