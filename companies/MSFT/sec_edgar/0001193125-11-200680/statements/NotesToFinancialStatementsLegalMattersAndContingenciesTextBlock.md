CONTINGENCIES

Government Competition Law
Matters

Since 2001, we have been
subject to a Consent Decree and Final Judgment (“ Final
Judgments”) that resolved lawsuits brought by the U. S.
Department of Justice, 18 states, and the District of Columbia in
two separate actions. The Final Judgments imposed various
constraints on our Windows operating system businesses. The Final
Judgments expired in May 2011.

In other ongoing
investigations, various foreign governments and several state
attorneys general have requested information from us concerning
competition, privacy, and security issues.

Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and
Overcharge Class Actions

A large number of
antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed
against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf
of various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC
operating system and certain other software products. We obtained
dismissals of damages claims of indirect purchasers under federal
law and in 15 states. Courts refused to certify classes in two
additional states. We have reached agreements to settle all claims
that have been made to date in 19 states and the District of
Columbia.

The settlements in all
states have received final court approval. Under the settlements,
generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them to be
reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral
computer hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we
may issue varies by state. We will make available to certain
schools a percentage of those vouchers that are not issued or
claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). The total
value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of
class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum
value of vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The
actual costs of these settlements will be less than that maximum
amount, depending on the number of class members and schools that
are issued and redeem vouchers. We estimate the total cost to
resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range
between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. At June 30, 2011, we
have recorded a liability related to these claims of approximately
$568 million, which reflects our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion
less payments made to date of approximately $1.3 billion mostly for
vouchers, legal fees, and administrative expenses.

The three cases pending
in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have not been
settled. In March 2010, the court in the British Columbia case
certified it as a class action. On April 15, 2011, the British
Columbia Court of Appeal reversed the class certification ruling
and dismissed the case, holding that indirect purchasers do not
have a claim. The plaintiffs have sought review by the Canadian
Supreme Court. The other two actions have been stayed.

Other Antitrust Litigation and
Claims

In November 2004, Novell,
Inc. (“ Novell”) filed a complaint in U. S. District
Court for the District of Utah (later transferred to federal court
in Maryland), asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims
against us related to Novell’s ownership of WordPerfect and
other productivity applications during the period between June 1994
and March 1996. In June 2005, the trial court granted our motion to
dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. In March 2010 the
trial court granted summary judgment in favor of Microsoft as to
all remaining claims. The court of appeals has reversed that
ruling, and the case is scheduled for trial in Utah in October
2011.

Patent and Intellectual Property
Claims

In 2003, we filed an
action in U. S. District Court in California seeking a declaratory
judgment that we do not infringe certain Alcatel-Lucent patents
(although this action began before the merger of Alcatel and Lucent
in 2006, for simplicity we refer to the post-merger entity of
Alcatel-Lucent). In April 2008, a jury returned a verdict in
Alcatel-Lucent’s favor in a trial on a consolidated group of
one video and three user interface patents. The jury concluded that
we had infringed two user interface patents and awarded $367
million in damages. In June 2008, the trial judge increased the
amount of damages to $512 million to include $145 million of
interest. We appealed that award. In December 2008, we entered into
a settlement agreement resolving all other litigation pending
between Microsoft and Alcatel-Lucent, leaving approximately $500
million remaining in dispute. In September 2009, the court of
appeals affirmed the liability award but vacated the verdict and
remanded the case to the trial court for a re-trial of the damages
ruling, indicating the damages previously awarded were too high.
Trial on the remanded damages claim was held in July
2011.

In October 2003, Uniloc
USA Inc. (“ Uniloc”), a subsidiary of a Singapore-based
company, filed a patent infringement suit in U. S. District Court in
Rhode Island, claiming that product activation technology
supporting Windows XP and certain other Microsoft programs violated
a Uniloc patent. After we obtained a favorable summary judgment
that we did not infringe any of the claims of this patent, the
court of appeals vacated the trial court decision and remanded the
case for trial. In April 2009, the jury returned a $388 million
verdict against us, including a finding of willful infringement. In
September 2009, the district court judge overturned the jury
verdict, ruling that the evidence did not support the jury’s
findings either that Microsoft infringed the patent or was willful.
Uniloc appealed, and in January 2011 the court of appeals reversed
the district court’s finding of non-infringement (thus
reinstating the jury verdict of infringement) but affirmed the
district court’s ruling that Microsoft was not willful and
affirmed the district court’s grant of a new trial on
damages.  Uniloc’s petition for rehearing of the court of
appeals’ decision as to damages was denied. A new trial on
damages has been set for January 2012.

In March 2007, i4i
Limited Partnership (“i4i”) sued Microsoft in U. S.
District Court in Texas claiming that certain custom XML technology
in Word 2003 and 2007 infringed i4i’s patent. In May 2009, a
jury returned a verdict against us, finding damages of $200 million
and that we willfully infringed the patent. In August 2009, the
court denied our post-trial motions and awarded enhanced damages of
$40 million and prejudgment interest of $37 million. The court
also issued a permanent injunction prohibiting additional
distribution of the allegedly infringing technology. We appealed
and the appellate court stayed the injunction pending our appeal.
In December 2009, the court of appeals rejected our appeal and
affirmed the trial court’s judgment and injunction, except
that the court of appeals modified the effective date of the
injunction to January 11, 2010. We appealed to the U. S.
Supreme Court, and in June 2011 the court affirmed the judgment of
the court of appeals.

In October 2010, we filed
suit against Motorola with the International Trade Commission
(“ ITC”) and in U. S. District Court in Washington for
infringement of nine Microsoft patents by Motorola’s
Android-based devices. Since then, Microsoft and Motorola have
filed additional actions against each other in the ITC and federal
courts in Washington, Wisconsin, Florida, and California. Microsoft
asserts Motorola’s Android-based devices violate 23 of its
patents, and Motorola asserts various Microsoft products (including
Windows, Windows Phone 7, Windows Mobile 6.5, Xbox, Bing Maps,
Hotmail, Messenger, and Exchange Server) violate 21 Motorola
patents. Microsoft also claims Motorola has breached its
contractual commitments to the Institute of Electrical and
Electronics Engineers (“ IEEE”) and International
Telecommunications Union (“ ITU”) to license identified
patents related to wireless and video coding technologies under
reasonable and non-discriminatory (“ RAND”) terms and
conditions. Motorola asserts that Microsoft breached contractual
commitments to the SD Card Association to license two patents under
RAND terms and conditions, and asserts federal antitrust and state
unfair business practice claims.  Trial in our ITC case is set
for August 2011, trial in Motorola’s ITC case is set for
October 2011, and trial of both parties’ patent infringement
claims in Florida also is set for October 2011.

In addition to these
cases, there are approximately 55 other patent infringement cases
pending against Microsoft.

Other

We also are subject to a
variety of other claims and suits that arise from time to time in
the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in
aggregate, will not have a material adverse impact on our financial
statements, these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and
management’s view of these matters may change in the
future.

As of June 30, 2011,
we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $693 million in other
current liabilities and $276 million in other long-term liabilities
for all of the contingent matters described in this note. While we
intend to vigorously defend these matters, there exists the
possibility of adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach
approximately $800 million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts.
Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on our financial
statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably
estimable.
