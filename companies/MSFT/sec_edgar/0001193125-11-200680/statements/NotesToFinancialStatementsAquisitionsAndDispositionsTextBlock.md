BUSINESS COMBINATIONS

During fiscal year 2011,
we acquired three entities for total consideration of $75 million,
substantially all of which was paid in cash. During fiscal year
2010, we acquired five entities for total consideration of $267
million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. During fiscal
year 2010, we also sold three entities for total consideration of
$600 million, including Razorfish in the second quarter of fiscal
year 2010. During fiscal year 2009, we acquired nine entities for
total consideration of $925 million, substantially all of which was
paid in cash. These entities have been included in or removed from
our consolidated results of operations since their acquisition or
sale dates, respectively. Pro forma results of operations have not
been presented because the effects of these business combinations,
individually and in the aggregate, were not material to our
consolidated results of operations.

Definitive Agreement with
Skype

On May 10, 2011, we
announced that we had entered into a definitive agreement with
Skype Global S.à. r. l. (“ Skype”) under which we
would acquire Skype, a leading internet communications company, for
$8.5 billion in cash. The acquisition will extend Skype’s
brand and reach of its network platform, while enhancing our
existing portfolio of real-time communications products and
services. The acquisition is subject to regulatory approvals and
other customary closing conditions. We obtained regulatory approval
in the U. S. and expect to obtain all remaining required regulatory
approvals during calendar year 2011.
