DEBT

Short-term Debt

During fiscal year 2011,
we repaid $1.0 billion of commercial paper, leaving zero
outstanding.

On November 5, 2010,
our $1.0 billion 364-day credit facility expired. This facility
served as a back-up for our commercial paper program. No amounts
were drawn against the credit facility during any of the periods
presented.

Long-term Debt

As of June 30, 2011,
the total carrying value and estimated fair value of our long-term
debt, including convertible debt, were $11.9 billion and $12.1
billion, respectively. This is compared to a carrying value and
estimated fair value of $4.9 billion and $5.2 billion,
respectively, as of June 30, 2010. The estimated fair value is
based on quoted prices for our publicly-traded debt as of
June 30, 2011 and 2010, as applicable.

Maturities of long-term
debt for each of the next five years and thereafter are as
follows:

Cash paid for interest on
our debt for fiscal years 2011 and 2010 was $197 million and $145
million, respectively. No cash was paid for debt interest for
fiscal year 2009.

Notes

The Notes are senior
unsecured obligations and rank equally with our other unsecured and
unsubordinated debt outstanding.

Convertible debt

In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero coupon convertible unsecured debt due on
June 15, 2013 in a private placement offering. Proceeds from
the offering were $1.24 billion, net of fees and expenses, which
were capitalized.

Each $1,000 principal
amount of notes is convertible into 29.94 shares of Microsoft
common stock at a conversion price of $33.40 per share. As of
June 30, 2011, the net carrying amount of our convertible debt
was $1.2 billion and the unamortized discount was $38
million.

Prior to March 15,
2013, the notes will be convertible, only in certain circumstances,
into cash and, if applicable, cash, shares of Microsoft’s
common stock, or a combination thereof, at our election. On or
after March 15, 2013, the notes will be convertible at any
time. Upon conversion, we will pay cash up to the aggregate
principal amount of the notes and pay or deliver cash, shares of
our common stock, or a combination of cash and shares of our common
stock, at our election.

Because the convertible
debt may be wholly or partially settled in cash, we are required to
separately account for the liability and equity components of the
notes in a manner that reflects our nonconvertible debt borrowing
rate when interest costs are recognized in subsequent periods. The
net proceeds of $1.24 billion were allocated between debt for $1.18
billion and stockholders’ equity for $58 million with the
portion in stockholders’ equity representing the fair value
of the option to convert the debt.

In connection with the
issuance of the notes, we entered into capped call transactions
with certain option counterparties who are initial purchasers of
the notes or their affiliates. The capped call transactions are
expected to reduce potential dilution of earnings per share upon
conversion of the notes. Under the capped call transactions, we
purchased from the option counterparties capped call options that
in the aggregate relate to the total number of shares of our common
stock underlying the notes, with a strike price equal to the
conversion price of the notes and with a cap price equal to $37.16.
The purchased capped calls were valued at $40 million and recorded
to stockholders’ equity.
