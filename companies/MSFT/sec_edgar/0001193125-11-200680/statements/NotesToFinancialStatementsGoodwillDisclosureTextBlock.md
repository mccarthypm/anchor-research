None of the amounts
recorded as goodwill are expected to be deductible for tax
purposes. The measurement period for purchase price allocations
ends as soon as information on the facts and circumstances becomes
available, but will not exceed 12 months. Adjustments in the
purchase price allocation may require a recasting of the amounts
allocated to goodwill retroactive to the period in which the
acquisition occurred. Any change in the goodwill amounts resulting
from foreign currency translations are presented as
“other” in the above table. Also included within
“other” for fiscal year 2010 is $285 million of
goodwill associated with business dispositions. See also Note 9
 - Business Combinations.

We test goodwill for
impairment annually on May 1 at the reporting unit level using
a fair value approach. No impairment of goodwill was identified as
of May 1, 2011.
