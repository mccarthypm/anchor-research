EARNINGS PER SHARE

Basic earnings per share
(“ EPS”) is computed based on the weighted average
number of shares of common stock outstanding during the period.
Diluted EPS is computed based on the weighted average number of
shares of common stock plus the effect of dilutive potential common
shares outstanding during the period using the treasury stock
method. Dilutive potential common shares include outstanding stock
options, stock awards, and shared performance stock awards. The
components of basic and diluted EPS are as follows:

We excluded the following
shares underlying stock-based awards from the calculations of
diluted EPS because their inclusion would have been
anti-dilutive:

  Shares excluded from calculations of  

The decrease in
anti-dilutive shares from fiscal year 2009 to 2010 was due mainly
to the decrease in employee stock options outstanding.

In June 2010, we issued
$1.25 billion of zero-coupon debt securities that are convertible
into shares of our common stock if certain conditions are
met.  As of June 30, 2011, none of these securities had
met price or other conditions that would make them eligible for
issuance and therefore were excluded from the calculation of either
the basic or diluted EPS. See Note 12  - Debt for
additional information.
