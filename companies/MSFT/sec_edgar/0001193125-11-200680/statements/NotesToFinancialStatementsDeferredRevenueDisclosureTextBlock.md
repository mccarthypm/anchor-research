UNEARNED REVENUE

Unearned revenue
comprises mainly unearned revenue from volume licensing programs,
as well as payments for offerings for which we have been paid in
advance and we earn the revenue when we provide the service or
software or otherwise meet the revenue recognition
criteria.

Volume Licensing
Programs

Unearned revenue from
volume licensing programs represents customer billings for
multi-year licensing arrangements paid either at inception of the
agreement or annually at the beginning of each billing coverage
period and accounted for as subscriptions with revenue recognized
ratably over the billing coverage period.

Also included in unearned
revenue are payments for post-delivery support and consulting
services to be performed in the future; Xbox LIVE subscriptions and
prepaid points; Microsoft Dynamics business solutions products;
technology guarantee programs; OEM minimum commitments; unspecified
upgrades or enhancements of Microsoft Internet Explorer on a
when-and-if-available basis for Windows XP; and other offerings for
which we have been paid in advance and earn the revenue when we
provide the service or software or otherwise meet the revenue
recognition criteria.
