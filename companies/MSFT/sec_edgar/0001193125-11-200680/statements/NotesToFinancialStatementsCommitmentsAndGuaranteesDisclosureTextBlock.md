COMMITMENTS AND GUARANTEES

Construction and Operating
Leases

We have committed $263
million for constructing new buildings, building improvements and
leasehold improvements as of June 30, 2011.

We have operating leases
for most U. S. and international sales and support offices and
certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases
was $525 million, $530 million, and $475 million, in fiscal years
2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. Future minimum rental
commitments under noncancellable facilities operating leases in
place as of June 30, 2011 are as follows:

Indemnifications

We provide
indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers
against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third
parties arising from the use of our products and certain other
matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications,
and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate
of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant
costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any
liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial
statements.

Yahoo! Commercial
Agreement

On December 4, 2009,
we entered into a definitive agreement with Yahoo! whereby
Microsoft will provide the exclusive algorithmic and paid search
platform for Yahoo! Web sites. The term of the agreement is 10
years subject to termination provisions after five years based on
performance.

Microsoft provided Yahoo!
with revenue per search guarantees for a period of 18 months after
implementation of the Microsoft search ads platform in each
country. These guarantees are calculated, paid and trued-up
periodically based on the cumulative reduction in revenue per
search, if any, during the 18-month period from pre-implementation
levels, except in the case of the U. S. and Canada where performance
during each of the first two calendar quarters after implementation
is independent and not cumulative. This is a rate guarantee and not
a guarantee of search volume. We estimate the total cost of the
revenue per search guarantees during the guarantee period could
range up to $150 million.

Microsoft also agreed to
reimburse Yahoo! for certain transition expenses incurred both
before and after the effective date of the agreement.

Finally, Microsoft also
agreed to reimburse Yahoo! for certain costs of running algorithmic
and paid search services prior to migration to Microsoft’s
platform.

Product Warranty

The changes in our
aggregate product warranty liabilities, which are included in other
current liabilities and other long term-liabilities on our balance
sheets, were as follows:
