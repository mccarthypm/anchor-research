EMPLOYEE STOCK AND SAVINGS PLANS

We grant stock-based
compensation to directors and employees. At June 30, 2011, an
aggregate of 583 million shares were authorized for future
grant under our stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards,
and shared performance stock awards, and excluding shares reserved
for issuance under our employee stock purchase plan. Awards that
expire or are canceled without delivery of shares generally become
available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of
Microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vestings of awards
granted under all of our stock plans.

Stock-based compensation
expense and related income tax benefits were as follows:

Options)

Stock awards

Stock awards
(“ SAs”) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of
Microsoft common stock as the award vests. Our SAs generally vest
over a five-year period.

Shared performance stock
awards

Shared performance stock
awards (“ SPSAs”) are a form of SA in which the number
of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance
against specified performance targets.

We granted SPSAs for
fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009 with performance periods of
July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011,  July 1,
2009 through June 30, 2010, and July 1, 2008 through
June 30, 2009, respectively. In August following the end of
each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to
the award is determined by multiplying the target award by a
percentage ranging from 0% to 150%. The percentage is based on
performance metrics for the performance period, as determined by
the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its sole
discretion. An additional number of shares, approximately 12% of
the total target SPSAs, are available as additional awards to
participants based on individual performance. One-quarter of the
shares of stock subject to each award vest following the end of the
performance period, and an additional one-quarter of the shares
vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant
date.

Executive Officer Incentive
Plan

Under the Executive
Officer Incentive Plan (“ EOIP”), the Compensation
Committee awards performance-based compensation to executive
officers of the Company for specified performance
periods.  During the periods reported, executive officers were
eligible to receive annual awards comprised of cash and SAs from an
aggregate incentive pool equal to a percentage of the
Company’s operating income. For fiscal years 2011, 2010, and
2009, the pool was 0.25%, 0.45%, and 0.35% of operating income,
respectively.

In September following
the end of the fiscal year, each executive officer may receive a
combined cash and SA award with a total value equal to a fixed
percentage of the aggregate pool. The fixed percentage ranges
between 0% and 150% of a target based on an assessment of the
executive officer’s performance during the prior fiscal year.
Following approval of the awards, 20% of the award is payable to
the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% is converted
into an SA for shares of Microsoft common stock. The number of
shares subject to the SA portion of the award is determined by
dividing the value of 80% of the total award by the closing price
of Microsoft common stock on the last business day in
August of each year. The SA portion of the award vests
one-quarter immediately after the award is approved following
fiscal year-end and one-quarter on August 31 of each of
the following three years.

Activity for all stock
plans

The fair value of each
award is estimated on the date of grant using the following
assumptions:

Savings Plan

We have a savings plan in
the U. S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international
locations. Participating U. S. employees may contribute up to 50% of
their salary, but not more than statutory limits. We contribute
fifty cents for each dollar a participant contributes in this plan,
with a maximum contribution of 3% of a participant’s
earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $282 million,
$275 million, and $262 million in fiscal years 2011, 2010, and
2009, respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching
contributions are invested proportionate to each
participant’s voluntary contributions in the investment
options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U. S.
plan include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor
our matching contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft
common stock.
