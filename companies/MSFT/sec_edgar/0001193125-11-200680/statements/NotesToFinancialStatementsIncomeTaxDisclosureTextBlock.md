The items accounting for
the difference between income taxes computed at the U. S. federal
statutory rate and our effective rate were as follows:

  Year Ended June 30,

  Federal statutory rate                 35.0%        35.0%       35.0%  
  Effect of:                                                             
  Foreign earnings taxed at lower      (15.6)%      (12.1)%      (9.3)%  
  Internal Revenue Service              (1.7)%           0%          0%  
  Other reconciling items,              (0.2)%         2.1%        0.8%  
  Effective rate                         17.5%        25.0%       26.5%  

The reduction from the
federal statutory rate from foreign earnings taxed at lower rates
results from producing and distributing our products and services
through our foreign regional operations centers in Ireland,
Singapore, and Puerto Rico, which are subject to lower income tax
rates. In general, other reconciling items consist of interest,
U. S. state income taxes, domestic production deductions, and
credits. In fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, there were no
individually significant other reconciling items. The I. R. S.
settlement is discussed below.

The components of the
deferred income tax assets and liabilities were as
follows:

Deferred income tax
balances reflect the effects of temporary differences between the
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the
taxes are actually paid or recovered.

We have not provided
deferred U. S. income taxes or foreign withholding taxes on
temporary differences of approximately $44.8 billion resulting from
earnings for certain non-U. S. subsidiaries which are permanently
reinvested outside the U. S. The unrecognized deferred tax liability
associated with these temporary differences is approximately $14.2
billion.

Income taxes paid were
$5.3 billion, $4.1 billion, and $6.6 billion in fiscal years 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

As of June 30, 2011,
we had $6.9 billion of unrecognized tax benefits of which $5.9
billion, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate. As of
June 30, 2010, we had $6.5 billion of unrecognized tax
benefits of which $5.6 billion, if recognized, would have affected
our effective tax rate.

Interest on unrecognized
tax benefits was $38 million, $193 million, and $230 million in
fiscal years 2011, 2010, and 2009, respectively. As of
June 30, 2011, 2010, and 2009, we had accrued interest related
to uncertain tax positions of $785 million, $747 million, and $554
million, respectively, net of federal income tax
benefits.

The aggregate changes in
the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as
follows:

During the third quarter
of fiscal year 2011, we reached a partial settlement agreement with
the I. R. S. on tax years 2004 to 2006 and recorded a $461 million
income tax provision benefit. During the fourth quarter of fiscal
year 2011, the I. R. S. completed its examination and issued a
Revenue Agent’s Report (“ RAR”) for the remaining
unresolved items. We do not agree with the adjustments in the RAR,
and we have filed a protest to initiate the administrative appeals
process. The proposed adjustments are primarily related to transfer
pricing and could have a significant impact on our financial
statements if not resolved favorably. We do not believe it is
reasonably possible that the total amount of unrecognized tax
benefits will significantly increase or decrease within the next 12
months, as we do not believe the appeals process will be concluded
within the next 12 months. We also continue to be subject to
examination by the I. R. S. for tax years 2007 to 2010.

We are subject to income
tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S., and certain
jurisdictions remain subject to examination and are currently under
audit by local tax authorities. The resolutions of these audits are
not expected to be material to our financial statements.
