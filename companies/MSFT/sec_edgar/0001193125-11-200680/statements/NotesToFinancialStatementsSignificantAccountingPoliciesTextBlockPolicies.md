| **      Accounting Principles** | Accounting
Principles

The financial statements
and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with accounting
principles generally accepted in the United States of America
(“ U. S. GAAP”).
 |
| **      Principles of Consolidation** | Principles of
Consolidation

The financial statements
include the accounts of Microsoft Corporation and its subsidiaries.
Intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated. Equity
investments through which we exercise significant influence over
but do not control the investee and are not the primary beneficiary
of the investee’s activities are accounted for using the
equity method. Investments through which we are not able to
exercise significant influence over the investee and which do not
have readily determinable fair values are accounted for under the
cost method.
 |
|       Estimates and Assumptions | Estimates and
Assumptions

Preparing financial
statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions
that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, revenue,
and expenses. Examples include: estimates of loss contingencies,
product warranties, product life cycles, product returns, and
stock-based compensation forfeiture rates; assumptions such as the
elements comprising a software arrangement, including the
distinction between upgrades/enhancements and new products; when
technological feasibility is achieved for our products; the
potential outcome of future tax consequences of events that have
been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns;
estimating the fair value and/or goodwill impairment for our
reporting units; and determining when investment impairments are
other-than-temporary. Actual results and outcomes may differ from
management’s estimates and assumptions.
 |
| **      Foreign Currencies** | Foreign Currencies

Assets and liabilities
recorded in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate
on the balance sheet date. Revenue and expenses are translated at
average rates of exchange prevailing during the year. Translation
adjustments resulting from this process are recorded to Other
Comprehensive Income (“ OCI”).
 |
| **      Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

Revenue is recognized
when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has
occurred, the fee is fixed or determinable, and collectibility is
probable. Revenue generally is recognized net of any taxes
collected from customers and subsequently remitted to governmental
authorities.

Revenue for retail
packaged products, products licensed to original equipment
manufacturers (“ OEMs”), and perpetual licenses under
certain volume licensing programs generally is recognized as
products are shipped or made available. Revenue for products under
technology guarantee programs, which provide free or significantly
discounted rights to use upcoming new versions of a software
product if an end user licenses existing versions of the product
during the eligibility period, is allocated between existing
product and the new product, and revenue allocated to the new
product is deferred until that version is delivered. The revenue
allocation is based on vendor-specific objective evidence of fair
value of the products.

Certain multi-year
licensing arrangements include a perpetual license for current
products combined with rights to receive future versions of
software products on a when-and-if-available basis (“ Software
Assurance”) and are accounted for as subscriptions, with
billings recorded as unearned revenue and recognized as revenue
ratably over the billing coverage period. Revenue from certain
arrangements that allow for the use of a product or service over a
period of time without taking possession of software are also
accounted for as subscriptions. Revenue for software products where
customers have the right to receive unspecified
upgrades/enhancements on a when-and-if-available basis and for
which vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value does not
exist for the upgrades/enhancements is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated life of the
software.

Revenue related to our
Xbox 360 gaming and entertainment console, Kinect for Xbox 360,
games published by us, and other hardware components is generally
recognized when ownership is transferred to the resellers. Revenue
related to games published by third parties for use on the Xbox 360
platform is recognized when games are manufactured by the game
publishers.

Display advertising
revenue is recognized as advertisements are displayed. Search
advertising revenue is recognized when the ad appears in the search
results or when the action necessary to earn the revenue has been
completed. Consulting services revenue is recognized as services
are rendered, generally based on the negotiated hourly rate in the
consulting arrangement and the number of hours worked during the
period. Consulting revenue for fixed-price services arrangements is
recognized as services are provided. Revenue from prepaid points
redeemable for the purchase of software or services is recognized
upon redemption of the points and delivery of the software or
services.
 |
| **      Cost of Revenue** | Cost of Revenue

Cost of revenue includes;
manufacturing and distribution costs for products sold and programs
licensed; operating costs related to product support service
centers and product distribution centers; costs incurred to include
software on PCs sold by OEMs, to drive traffic to our Web sites,
and to acquire online advertising space (“traffic acquisition
costs”); costs incurred to support and maintain
Internet-based products and services, including royalties; warranty
costs; inventory valuation adjustments; costs associated with the
delivery of consulting services; and the amortization of
capitalized research and development costs. Capitalized research
and development costs are amortized over the estimated lives of the
products.
 |
|       Product Warranty | Product Warranty

We provide for the
estimated costs of fulfilling our obligations under hardware and
software warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized.
For hardware warranties, we estimate the costs based on historical
and projected product failure rates, historical and projected
repair costs, and knowledge of specific product failures (if any).
The specific hardware warranty terms and conditions vary depending
upon the product sold and the country in which we do business, but
generally include parts and labor over a period generally ranging
from 90 days to three years. For software warranties, we
estimate the costs to provide bug fixes, such as security patches,
over the estimated life of the software. We regularly reevaluate
our estimates to assess the adequacy of the recorded warranty
liabilities and adjust the amounts as necessary.
 |
| **      Research and Development** | Research and
Development

Research and development
expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with product development. Research and development
expenses also include third-party development and programming
costs, localization costs incurred to translate software for
international markets, and the amortization of purchased software
code and services content. Such costs related to software
development are included in research and development expense until
the point that technological feasibility is reached, which for our
software products, is generally shortly before the products are
released to manufacturing. Once technological feasibility is
reached, such costs are capitalized and amortized to cost of
revenue over the estimated lives of the products.
 |
| **      Sales and Marketing** | Sales and Marketing

Sales and marketing
expenses include payroll, employee benefits, stock-based
compensation expense, and other headcount-related expenses
associated with sales and marketing personnel, and the costs of
advertising, promotions, trade shows, seminars, and other programs.
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was
$1.9 billion, $1.6 billion, and $1.4 billion in fiscal years 2011,
2010, and 2009, respectively.
 |
| **      Employee Severance** | Employee Severance

We record employee
severance when a specific plan has been approved by management, the
plan has been communicated to employees, and it is unlikely that
significant changes will be made to the plan. In January 2009, we
announced and implemented a resource management program to reduce
discretionary operating expenses, employee headcount, and capital
expenditures. Severance expenses associated with this program were
$59 million and $330 million in fiscal years 2010 and 2009,
respectively, and are included in general and administrative
expenses.
 |
|       Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-Based
Compensation

We measure stock-based
compensation cost at the grant date based on the fair value of the
award and recognize it as expense over the vesting or service
period, as applicable, of the stock award (generally four to five
years) using the straight-line method.
 |
| **      Employee Stock Purchase Plan** | Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

Shares of our common
stock may be purchased by employees at three-month intervals at 90%
of the fair market value of the stock on the last day of each
three-month period. Compensation expense for the employee stock
purchase plan is measured as the discount the employee is entitled
to upon purchase and is recognized in the period of
purchase.
 |
| **      Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income tax expense
includes U. S. and international income taxes, the provision for
U. S. taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries
not deemed to be permanently invested, and interest and penalties
on uncertain tax positions. Certain income and expenses are not
reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year.
The tax effect of such temporary differences is reported as
deferred income taxes. The deferred income taxes are classified as
current or long-term based on the classification of the related
asset or liability.
 |
|       Fair Value Measurements | Fair Value
Measurements

We account for certain
assets and liabilities at fair value. The hierarchy below lists
three levels of fair value based on the extent to which inputs used
in measuring fair value are observable in the market.  We
categorize each of our fair value measurements in one of these
three levels based on the lowest level input that is significant to
the fair value measurement in its entirety. These levels
are:

  Level 1 – inputs are based upon unadjusted quoted               

  Level 2 – inputs are based upon quoted prices for                    

  Level 3 – inputs are generally unobservable and                      

We measure certain
assets, including our cost and equity method investments, at fair
value on a nonrecurring basis when they are deemed to be
other-than-temporarily impaired. The fair values of these
investments are determined based on valuation techniques using the
best information available, and may include quoted market prices,
market comparables, and discounted cash flow projections. An
impairment charge is recorded when the cost of the investment
exceeds its fair value and this condition is determined to be
other-than-temporary.

Our current financial
liabilities have fair values that approximate their carrying
values. Our long-term financial liabilities consist of long-term
debt which is recorded on the balance sheet at issuance price less
unamortized discount.
 |
| **      Financial Instruments** | Financial
Instruments

We consider all highly
liquid interest-earning investments with a maturity of three months
or less at the date of purchase to be cash equivalents. The fair
values of these investments approximate their carrying values. In
general, investments with original maturities of greater than three
months and remaining maturities of less than one year are
classified as short-term investments. Investments with maturities
beyond one year may be classified as short-term based on their
highly liquid nature and because such marketable securities
represent the investment of cash that is available for current
operations. All cash equivalents and short-term investments are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI.

Equity and other
investments classified as long-term include both debt and equity
instruments. Debt and publicly-traded equity securities are
classified as available-for-sale and realized gains and losses are
recorded using the specific identification method. Changes in
market value, excluding other-than-temporary impairments, are
reflected in OCI. Common and preferred stock and other investments
that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly
traded are recorded at cost or using the equity method.

We lend certain
fixed-income and equity securities to increase investment returns.
The loaned securities continue to be carried as investments on our
balance sheet. Cash and/or security interests are received as
collateral for the loan securities with the amount determined based
upon the underlying security lent and the creditworthiness of the
borrower. Cash received is recorded as an asset with a
corresponding liability.

Investments are
considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to
be other-than-temporary. Fair value is calculated based on publicly
available market information or other estimates determined by
management. We employ a systematic methodology on a quarterly basis
that considers available quantitative and qualitative evidence in
evaluating potential impairment of our investments. If the cost of
an investment exceeds its fair value, we evaluate, among other
factors, general market conditions, credit quality of debt
instrument issuers, the duration and extent to which the fair value
is less than cost, and for equity securities, our intent and
ability to hold, or plans to sell, the investment. For fixed-income
securities, we also evaluate whether we have plans to sell the
security or it is more likely than not that we will be required to
sell the security before recovery. We also consider specific
adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business
outlook for the investee, including industry and sector
performance, changes in technology, and operational and financing
cash flow factors. Once a decline in fair value is determined to be
other-than-temporary, an impairment charge is recorded to other
income (expense) and a new cost basis in the investment is
established.

Derivative instruments
are recognized as either assets or liabilities and are measured at
fair value. The accounting for changes in the fair value of a
derivative depends on the intended use of the derivative and the
resulting designation.

For a derivative
instrument designated as a fair-value hedge, the gain (loss) is
recognized in earnings in the period of change together with the
offsetting loss or gain on the hedged item attributed to the risk
being hedged. For options designated as fair-value hedges, changes
in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge
effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.

For derivative
instruments designated as cash-flow hedges, the effective portion
of the derivative’s gain (loss) is initially reported as a
component of OCI and is subsequently recognized in earnings when
the hedged exposure is recognized in earnings. For options
designated as cash-flow hedges, changes in the time value are
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are
recognized in earnings. Gains (losses) on derivatives representing
either hedge components excluded from the assessment of
effectiveness or hedge ineffectiveness are recognized in
earnings.

For derivative
instruments that are not designated as hedges, gains (losses) from
changes in fair values are primarily recognized in other income
(expense). Other than those derivatives entered into for investment
purposes, such as commodity contracts, the gains (losses) are
generally economically offset by unrealized gains (losses) in the
underlying available-for-sale securities, which are recorded as a
component of OCI until the securities are sold or
other-than-temporarily impaired, at which time the amounts are
moved from OCI into other income (expense).
 |
| **      Allowance for Doubtful Accounts** | Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The allowance for
doubtful accounts reflects our best estimate of probable losses
inherent in the accounts receivable balance. We determine the
allowance based on known troubled accounts, historical experience,
and other currently available evidence.
 |
| **      Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are stated at
the lower of cost or market, using the average cost method. Cost
includes materials, labor, and manufacturing overhead related to
the purchase and production of inventories. We regularly review
inventory quantities on hand, future purchase commitments with our
suppliers, and the estimated utility of our inventory. If our
review indicates a reduction in utility below carrying value, we
reduce our inventory to a new cost basis through a charge to cost
of revenue.
 |
| **      Property and Equipment** | Property and
Equipment

Property and equipment is
stated at cost and depreciated using the straight-line method over
the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset or the lease
term. The estimated useful lives of our property and equipment are
generally as follows: computer software developed or acquired for
internal use, three years; computer equipment, two to three years;
buildings and improvements, five to 15 years; leasehold
improvements, two to 10 years; and furniture and equipment, one to
five years. Land is not depreciated.
 |
|       Goodwill | Goodwill

Goodwill is tested for
impairment at the reporting unit level (operating segment or one
level below an operating segment) on an annual basis (May 1 for us)
and between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change
that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a
reporting unit below its carrying value.
 |
|       Intangible Assets | Intangible Assets

All of our intangible
assets are subject to amortization and are amortized using the
straight-line method over their estimated period of benefit,
ranging from one to 10 years. We evaluate the recoverability of
intangible assets periodically by taking into account events or
circumstances that may warrant revised estimates of useful lives or
that indicate the asset may be impaired.
 |
| **      Recently adopted accounting pronouncements** | Recently adopted accounting
pronouncements

On July 1, 2010, we
adopted guidance issued by the Financial Accounting Standards Board
(“ FASB”) on revenue recognition. Under the new guidance
on arrangements that include software elements, tangible products
that have software components that are essential to the
functionality of the tangible product are no longer within the
scope of the software revenue recognition guidance, and
software-enabled products are now subject to other relevant revenue
recognition guidance. Additionally, the FASB issued guidance on
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables that are outside
the scope of the software revenue recognition guidance. Under the
new guidance, when vendor specific objective evidence or third
party evidence for deliverables in an arrangement cannot be
determined, a best estimate of the selling price is required to
separate deliverables and allocate arrangement consideration using
the relative selling price method. The new guidance includes new
disclosure requirements on how the application of the relative
selling price method affects the timing and amount of revenue
recognition. Adoption of the new guidance did not have a material
impact on our financial statements.

On July 1, 2010, we
adopted new guidance issued by the FASB on the consolidation of
variable interest entities. The new guidance requires revised
evaluations of whether entities represent variable interest
entities, ongoing assessments of control over such entities, and
additional disclosures for variable interests. Adoption of the new
guidance did not have a material impact on our financial
statements.
 |
| **      Recent accounting pronouncements not yet adopted** | Recent accounting pronouncements
not yet adopted

In June 2011, the FASB
issued guidance on presentation of comprehensive income.  The
new guidance eliminates the current option to report other
comprehensive income and its components in the statement of changes
in equity.  Instead, an entity will be required to present
either a continuous statement of net income and other comprehensive
income or in two separate but consecutive statements.  The new
guidance will be effective for us beginning July 1, 2012 and
will have presentation changes only.

In May 2011, the FASB
issued guidance to amend the accounting and disclosure requirements
on fair value measurements.  The new guidance limits the
highest-and-best-use measure to nonfinancial assets, permits
certain financial assets and liabilities with offsetting positions
in market or counterparty credit risks to be measured at a net
basis, and provides guidance on the applicability of premiums and
discounts.  Additionally, the new guidance expands the
disclosures on Level 3 inputs by requiring quantitative disclosure
of the unobservable inputs and assumptions, as well as description
of the valuation processes and the sensitivity of the fair value to
changes in unobservable inputs. The new guidance will be effective
for us beginning January 1, 2012.  Other than requiring
additional disclosures, we do not anticipate material impacts on
our financial statements upon adoption.

In January 2010, the FASB
issued guidance to amend the disclosure requirements related to
fair value measurements. The guidance requires the disclosure of
roll forward activities on purchases, sales, issuance, and
settlements of the assets and liabilities measured using
significant unobservable inputs (Level 3 fair value measurements).
The guidance will become effective for us with the reporting period
beginning July 1, 2011. Other than requiring additional
disclosures, the adoption of this new guidance will not have a
material impact on our financial statements.
