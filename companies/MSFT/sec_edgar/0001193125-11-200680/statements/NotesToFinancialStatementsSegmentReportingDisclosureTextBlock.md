SEGMENT INFORMATION AND GEOGRAPHIC DATA

In its operation of the
business, management, including our chief operating decision maker,
the Company’s Chief Executive Officer, reviews certain
financial information, including segmented internal profit and loss
statements prepared on a basis not consistent with U. S. GAAP. The
segment information within this note is reported on that basis. Our
five segments are Windows & Windows Live Division; Server
and Tools; Online Services Division; Microsoft Business Division;
and Entertainment and Devices Division.

Due to the integrated
structure of our business, certain revenue earned and costs
incurred by one segment may benefit other segments. Revenue on
certain contracts may be allocated among the segments based on the
relative value of the underlying products and services. Costs that
are identifiable are allocated to the segments that benefit to
incent cross-collaboration among our segments so that one segment
is not solely burdened by the cost of a mutually beneficial
activity. Allocated costs may include those relating to development
and marketing of products and services from which multiple segments
benefit, or those costs relating to services performed by one
segment on behalf of other segments. Each allocation is measured
differently based on the specific facts and circumstances of the
costs being allocated.

In addition, certain
costs incurred at a corporate level that are identifiable and that
benefit our segments are allocated to them. These allocated costs
include costs of: field selling; employee benefits; shared
facilities services; and customer service and support. Each
allocation is measured differently based on the specific facts and
circumstances of the costs being allocated. Certain other
corporate-level activity is not allocated to our segments,
including costs of: broad-based sales and marketing; product
support services; human resources; legal; finance; information
technology; corporate development and procurement activities;
research and development; legal settlements and contingencies; and
employee severance.

We have recast certain
prior period amounts within this note to conform to the way we
internally managed and monitored segment performance during the
current fiscal year, including moving Microsoft’s PC hardware
business from Entertainment and Devices Division to
Windows & Windows Live Division, Windows Embedded from
Entertainment and Devices Division to Server and Tools, and Office
for Mac from Entertainment and Devices Division to Microsoft
Business Division, as well as implementing intersegment cost
allocations between all segments related to the collaborative
investment in mobile platform development.

The principal products
and services provided by each segment are summarized
below:

Windows &
Windows Live Division

Server and Tools

Online Services
Division

Microsoft Business
Division

Entertainment and
Devices Division

Segment revenue and
operating income (loss) were as follows during the periods

Assets are not allocated
to segments for internal reporting presentations. A portion of
amortization and depreciation is included with various other costs
in an overhead allocation to each segment and it is impracticable
for us to separately identify the amount of amortization and
depreciation by segment that is included in the measure of segment
profit or loss.
