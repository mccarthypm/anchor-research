We grant stock-based compensation to employees and directors. As of June 30, 
2018, an aggregate of 381 million shares were authorized for future grant under 
our stock plans. In fiscal year 2018, our Board of Directors approved the 2017 
Stock Plan, which authorized an additional 308 million shares for future grant 
under our stock plans. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of 
shares generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new 
shares of Microsoft common stock to satisfy vesting of awards granted under our 
stock plans. We also have an ESPP for all eligible employees.

Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as

Stock Plans

Stock awards entitle the holder to receive shares of Microsoft common stock as 
the award vests. Stock awards generally vest over a four or five-year service 
period.

Executive Incentive Plan

Under the Executive Incentive Plan, the Compensation Committee approves stock 
awards to executive officers and certain senior executives. RSUs generally vest 
ratably over a four-year service period. PSUs generally vest over a three-year 
performance period. The number of shares the PSU holder receives is based on the
extent to which the corresponding performance goals have been achieved.

Activity for All Stock Plans

The fair value of stock awards was estimated on the date of grant using the 
following assumptions:

to certain limitations. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a participant 
contributes in this plan, with a maximum employer contribution of 50% of the IRS
contribution limit for the calendar year. Matching contributions for all plans
