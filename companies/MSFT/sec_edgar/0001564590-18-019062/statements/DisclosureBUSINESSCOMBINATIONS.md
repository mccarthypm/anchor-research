LinkedIn Corporation

On December 8, 2016, we completed our acquisition of all issued and outstanding 
shares of LinkedIn Corporation, the world’s largest professional network on the 
Internet, for a total purchase price of $27.0 billion. The purchase price 
consisted primarily of cash of $26.9 billion. The acquisition is expected to 
accelerate the growth of LinkedIn, Office 365, and Dynamics 365. The financial 
results of LinkedIn have been included in our consolidated financial statements 
since the date of the acquisition.

The allocation of the purchase price to goodwill was completed as of June 30, 
2017.

The major classes of assets and liabilities to which we allocated the purchase 
price were as follows:

Following are the supplemental consolidated financial results of Microsoft 
Corporation on an unaudited pro forma basis, as if the acquisition had been 
consummated on July 1, 2015:

  (In millions, except earnings per share)                          
  Year Ended June 30,                             2017        2016

  Net income                                    25,179      19,128  
  Diluted earnings per share                      3.21        2.38  

These pro forma results were based on estimates and assumptions, which we 
believe are reasonable. They are not the results that would have been realized 
had we been a combined company during the periods presented and are not 
necessarily indicative of our consolidated results of operations in future 
periods. The pro forma results include adjustments related to purchase 
accounting, primarily amortization of intangible assets. Acquisition costs and 
other nonrecurring charges were immaterial and are included in the earliest 
period presented.

GitHub Inc.

On June 4, 2018, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire GitHub Inc. 
(“ GitHub”) for $7.5 billion in an all-stock transaction. We expect the 
acquisition will close by the end of the calendar year, subject to approval by 
GitHub’s shareholders, satisfaction of certain regulatory approvals, and other 
customary closing conditions. GitHub will be included in our consolidated 
results of operations as of the date of acquisition.

Other

During fiscal year 2018, we completed nine acquisitions for total consideration 
of $948 million, substantially all of which was paid in cash. These entities 
have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their 
respective acquisition dates. Pro forma results of operations for these 
acquisitions have not been presented because the effects of these business 
combinations, individually and in aggregate, were not material to our 
consolidated results of operations.
