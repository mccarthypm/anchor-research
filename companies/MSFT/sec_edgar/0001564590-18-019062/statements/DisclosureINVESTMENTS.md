As of June 30, 2018 and 2017, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock 
that are restricted for more than one year or are not publicly traded were $999 
million and $1.1 billion, respectively. These investments are carried at cost 
and are reviewed quarterly for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It
is not practicable for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these 
investments.

As of June 30,2018 and 2017, collateral received under agreements for loaned 
securities was $1.8 billion and $3.7 billion, respectively, and primarily 
comprised U. S. government and agency securities.

Investments with continuous unrealized losses for less than 12 months and 12 
months or greater and their related fair values were as follows:

Unrealized losses from fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to 
changes in interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international 
equities are due to market price movements. Management does not believe any 
remaining unrealized losses represent other-than-temporary impairments based on 
our evaluation of available evidence.
