No material impairments of intangible assets were identified during fiscal year 
2018 or 2017.

During fiscal year 2016, we recorded impairment charges of $480 million related 
to intangible assets in the Devices reporting unit within our More Personal 
Computing segment. In the fourth quarter of fiscal year 2016, we tested these 
intangible assets for recoverability due to changes in facts and circumstances 
associated with the shift in strategic direction and reduced profitability 
expectations for our Phone business. Based on the results of our testing, we 
determined that the carrying value of the intangible assets was not recoverable,
and an impairment charge was recorded to the extent that estimated fair value 
exceeded carrying value. We primarily used the income approach to determine the 
fair value of the intangible assets and determine the amount of impairment.

These intangible assets impairment charges were included in impairment and 
restructuring expenses in our consolidated income statement and reflected in 
Corporate and Other in our table of operating income (loss) by segment in Note 
21 - Segment Information and Geographic Data.

We estimate that we have no significant residual value related to our intangible
assets.

The components of intangible assets acquired during the periods presented were 
as follows:
