Recent Tax Legislation

On December 22, 2017, the TCJA was enacted into law, which significantly changes
existing U. S. tax law and includes numerous provisions that affect our 
business, such as imposing a one-time transition tax on deemed repatriation of 
deferred foreign income, reducing the U. S. federal statutory tax rate, and 
adopting a territorial tax system. The TCJA required us to incur a one-time 
transition tax on deferred foreign income not previously subject to U. S. income
tax at a rate of 15.5% for foreign cash and certain other net current assets, 
and 8% on the remaining income. The TCJA also reduced the U. S. federal 
statutory tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018. For fiscal year 
2018, our blended U. S. federal statutory tax rate is 28.1%. This is the result 
of using the tax rate of 35% for the first and second quarter of fiscal year 
2018 and the reduced tax rate of 21% for the third and fourth quarter of fiscal 
year 2018. The TCJA includes a provision to tax global intangible low-taxed 
income (“ GILTI”) of foreign subsidiaries and a base erosion anti-abuse tax (“ 
BEAT”) measure that taxes certain payments between a U. S. corporation and its 
foreign subsidiaries. The GILTI and BEAT provisions of the TCJA will be 
effective for us beginning July 1, 2018.

The TCJA was effective in the second quarter of fiscal year 2018. As of June 30,
2018, we have not completed our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the 
TCJA. During fiscal year 2018, we recorded a provisional net charge of $13.7 
billion related to the TCJA based on reasonable estimates for those tax effects.
Due to the timing of the enactment and the complexity in applying the provisions
of the TCJA, the provisional net charge is subject to revisions as we continue 
to complete our analysis of the TCJA, collect and prepare necessary data, and 
interpret any additional guidance issued by the U. S. Treasury Department, 
Internal Revenue Service (“ IRS”), FASB, and other standard-setting and 
regulatory bodies. Adjustments may materially impact our provision for income 
taxes and effective tax rate in the period in which the adjustments are made. 
Our accounting for the estimated tax effects of the TCJA will be completed 
during the measurement period, which is not expected to extend beyond one year 
from the enactment date. The impacts of our estimates are described further 
below.

During fiscal year 2018, we recorded an estimated net charge of $13.7 billion 
related to the TCJA, due to the impact of the one-time transition tax on the 
deemed repatriation of deferred foreign income of $17.9 billion, offset in part 
by the impact of changes in the tax rate of $4.2 billion, primarily on deferred 
tax assets and liabilities.

We recorded an estimated $17.9 billion charge in fiscal year 2018 related to the
transition tax, which was included in the provision for income taxes in our 
consolidated income statements and income taxes in our consolidated balance 
sheets. We have not yet completed our accounting for the transition tax as our 
analysis of deferred foreign income is not complete. To calculate the transition
tax, we estimated our deferred foreign income for fiscal year 2018 because these
tax returns are not complete or due. Fiscal year 2018 taxable income will be 
known once the respective tax returns are completed and filed. In addition, U. 
S. and foreign audit settlements may significantly impact the estimated 
transition tax. The impact of the U. S. and foreign audits on the transition tax
will be known as the audits are concluded.

In addition, we recorded an estimated $4.2 billion benefit in fiscal year 2018 
from the impact of changes in the tax rate, primarily on deferred tax assets and
liabilities, which was included in provision for income taxes in our 
consolidated income statements and deferred income taxes and long-term income 
taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. We remeasured our deferred taxes to 
reflect the reduced rate that will apply when these deferred taxes are settled 
or realized in future periods.

The TCJA subjects a U. S. corporation to tax on its GILTI. Due to the complexity
of the new GILTI tax rules, we are continuing to evaluate this provision of the 
TCJA and the application of GAAP. Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy 
election to either treat taxes due on the GILTI inclusion as a current period 
expense or factor such amounts into our measurement of deferred taxes. We 
elected the deferred method, and the corresponding deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are included in the table of deferred income tax assets and 
liabilities below.

On August 1, 2018, the Internal Revenue Service published on its website 
proposed regulations relating to the transition tax imposed by the TCJA. Once 
published in the Federal Register, the proposed regulations are subject to a 
60-day comment period. Final regulations are expected to be issued after 
consideration of comments. We are currently evaluating the impact of the 
proposed regulations.

14.8%        19.9%  

The increase from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2018 is primarily 
due to the net charge related to the enactment of the TCJA in the second quarter
of fiscal year 2018, offset in part by earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign 
jurisdictions. The decrease from the federal statutory rate in fiscal year 2017 
and 2016 is primarily due to earnings taxed at lower rates in foreign 
jurisdictions. Our foreign regional operating centers in Ireland, Singapore and 
Puerto Rico, which are taxed at rates lower than the U. S. rate, generated 87%, 
76%, and 91% of our foreign income before tax in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 
2016, respectively. Other reconciling items, net consists primarily of tax 
credits, U. S. state income taxes, and domestic production activities deduction.
In fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, there were no individually significant 
other reconciling items.

The increase in our effective tax rate for fiscal year 2018 compared to fiscal 
year 2017 was primarily due to the net charge related to the enactment of the 
TCJA and the realization of tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business
losses in fiscal year 2017. The decrease in our effective tax rate for fiscal 
year 2017 compared to fiscal year 2016 was primarily due to the realization of 
tax benefits attributable to previous Phone business losses, offset in part by 
changes in the mix of our income before income taxes between the U. S. and 
foreign countries.

We recorded a deferred tax liability of $7.4 billion related to the recognition 
of revenue as part of the adoption of the new revenue standard.

As of June 30, 2018, we had federal, state and foreign net operating loss 
carryforwards of $257 million, $1.4 billion and $11.4 billion, respectively. The
federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in various years 
from fiscal 2019 through 2038, if not utilized. The majority of our foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards do not expire. Certain acquired net operating loss 
carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation, but are expected to be 
realized with the exception of those which have a valuation allowance.

The valuation allowance disclosed in the table above relates to the foreign net 
operating loss carryforwards and other net deferred tax assets that may not be 
realized.

Deferred income tax balances reflect the effects of temporary differences 
between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities and their tax bases and 
are stated at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when the taxes are paid
or recovered.

Income taxes paid, net of refunds, were $5.5 billion, $2.4 billion, and $3.9 
billion in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Unrecognized tax benefits as of June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, were $12.0 
billion, $11.7 billion, and $10.2 billion, respectively, and were included in 
long-term income taxes in our consolidated balance sheets. If recognized, these 
tax benefits would affect our effective tax rates for fiscal years 2018, 2017, 
and 2016, by $11.3 billion, $10.2 billion, and $8.8 billion, respectively.

As of June 30, 2018, 2017, and 2016, we had accrued interest expense related to 
uncertain tax positions of $3.0 billion, $2.3 billion, and $1.9 billion, 
respectively, net of income tax benefits. Interest expense on unrecognized tax 
benefits, net of tax effects, was $688 million, $399 million, and $163 million 
in fiscal years 2018, 2017, and 2016, respectively, and was included in 
provision for income taxes.

The aggregate changes in the balance of unrecognized tax benefits were as 
follows:

While we settled a portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2004 to 2006 during 
the third quarter of fiscal year 2011, and a portion of the IRS audit for tax 
years 2007 to 2009 during the first quarter of fiscal year 2016, we remain under
audit for those years. In the second quarter of fiscal year 2018, we settled a 
portion of the IRS audit for tax years 2010 to 2013. We continue to be subject 
to examination by the IRS for tax years 2010 to 2017. In February 2012, the IRS 
withdrew its 2011 Revenue Agents Report for tax years 2004 to 2006 and reopened 
the audit phase of the examination. As of June 30, 2018, the primary unresolved 
issue relates to transfer pricing, which could have a significant impact in our 
consolidated financial statements if not resolved favorably. We believe our 
allowances for income tax contingencies are adequate. We have not received a 
proposed assessment for the unresolved issues and do not expect a final 
resolution of these issues in the next 12 months. Based on the information 
currently available, we do not anticipate a significant increase or decrease to 
our tax contingencies for these issues within the next 12 months.

We are subject to income tax in many jurisdictions outside the U. S. Our 
operations in certain jurisdictions remain subject to examination for tax years 
1996 to 2017, some of which are currently under audit by local tax authorities. 
The resolution of each of these audits is not expected to be material to our 
consolidated financial statements.
