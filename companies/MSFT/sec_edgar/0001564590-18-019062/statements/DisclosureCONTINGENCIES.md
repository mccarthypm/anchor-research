Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

There were 34 patent infringement cases pending against Microsoft as of June 30,
2018, none of which are material individually or in aggregate.

Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions

Antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were filed against us in 
British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada. All three have been certified on 
behalf of Canadian indirect purchasers who acquired licenses for Microsoft 
operating system software and/or productivity application software between 1998 
and 2010.

The trial of the British Columbia action commenced in May 2016. Following a 
mediation, the parties agreed to a global settlement of all three Canadian 
actions, and have submitted the proposed settlement agreement to the courts in 
all three jurisdictions for approval. The courts will likely reach a decision on
approval in September 2018.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims

China State Administration for Industry and Commerce Investigation

In 2014, Microsoft was informed that China’s State Agency for Market Regulation 
(“ SAMR”) (formerly State Administration for Industry and Commerce) had begun a 
formal investigation relating to China’s Anti-Monopoly Law, and the SAMR 
conducted onsite inspections of Microsoft offices in Beijing, Shanghai, 
Guangzhou, and Chengdu. SAMR has stated the investigation relates to 
compatibility, bundle sales, file verification issues related to Windows and 
Office software, and potentially other issues.

Product-Related Litigation

U. S. Cell Phone Litigation

Microsoft Mobile Oy, a subsidiary of Microsoft, along with other handset 
manufacturers and network operators, is a defendant in 35 lawsuits filed in the 
Superior Court for the District of Columbia by individual plaintiffs who allege 
that radio emissions from cellular handsets caused their brain tumors and other 
adverse health effects. We assumed responsibility for these claims in our 
agreement to acquire Nokia’s Devices and Services business and have been 
substituted for the Nokia defendants. Nine of these cases were filed in 2002 and
are consolidated for certain pre-trial proceedings; the remaining cases are 
stayed. In a separate 2009 decision, the Court of Appeals for the District of 
Columbia held that adverse health effect claims arising from the use of cellular
handsets that operate within the U. S. Federal Communications Commission radio 
frequency emission guidelines (“ FCC Guidelines”) are pre-empted by federal law.
The plaintiffs allege that their handsets either operated outside the FCC 
Guidelines or were manufactured before the FCC Guidelines went into effect. The 
lawsuits also allege an industry-wide conspiracy to manipulate the science and 
testing around emission guidelines.

In 2013, the defendants in the consolidated cases moved to exclude the 
plaintiffs’ expert evidence of general causation on the basis of flawed 
scientific methodologies. In 2014, the trial court granted in part and denied in
part the defendants’ motion to exclude the plaintiffs’ general causation 
experts. The defendants filed an interlocutory appeal challenging the standard 
for evaluating expert scientific evidence, which the District of Columbia Court 
of Appeals hearden banc. In October 2016, the Court of Appeals issued its 
decision adopting the standard advocated by the defendants and remanding the 
cases to the trial court for further proceedings under that standard. The 
plaintiffs have filed supplemental expert evidence, portions of which the 
defendants have moved to strike.

Canadian Cell Phone Class Action

Microsoft Mobile Oy, along with other handset manufacturers and network 
operators, is a defendant in a 2013 class action lawsuit filed in the Supreme 
Court of British Columbia by a purported class of Canadians who have used 
cellular phones for at least 1,600 hours, including a subclass of users with 
brain tumors, alleging adverse health effects from cellular phone use. Microsoft
was served with the complaint in June 2014 and has been substituted for the 
Nokia defendants. The litigation has been dormant for more than three years.

Employment-Related Litigation

Moussouris v. Microsoft

Current and former female Microsoft employees in certain engineering and 
information technology roles brought this class action in federal court in 
Seattle in 2015, alleging systemic gender discrimination in pay and promotions. 
The plaintiffs moved to certify the class in October 2017. Microsoft filed an 
opposition in January 2018, attaching an expert report showing no statistically 
significant disparity in pay and promotions between similarly situated men and 
women. In June 2018, the court denied the plaintiffs’ motion for class 
certification. The plaintiffs have appealed to the U. S. Court of Appeals for 
the Ninth Circuit. In July, the court denied Microsoft’s motion for summary 
judgment with respect to the named plaintiffs.

Other Contingencies

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time 
to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently 
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have a material adverse impact in our consolidated financial statements, 
these matters are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of 
these matters may change in the future.

As of June 30, 2018, we accrued aggregate legal liabilities of $323 million. 
While we intend to defend these matters vigorously, adverse outcomes that we 
estimate could reach approximately $1.1 billion in aggregate beyond recorded 
amounts are reasonably possible. Were unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact in our consolidated 
financial statements for the period in which the effects become reasonably 
estimable.

Indemnifications

We provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers 
against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties 
arising from the use of our products and certain other matters. Additionally, we
have agreed to cover damages resulting from breaches of certain security and 
privacy commitments in our cloud business. In evaluating estimated losses on 
these obligations, we consider factors such as the degree of probability of an 
unfavorable outcome and our ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount 
of loss. These obligations did not have a material impact in our consolidated 
financial statements during the periods presented.
