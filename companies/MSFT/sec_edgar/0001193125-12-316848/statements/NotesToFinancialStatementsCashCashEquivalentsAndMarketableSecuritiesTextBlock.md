Unrealized losses from
fixed-income securities are primarily attributable to changes in
interest rates. Unrealized losses from domestic and international
equities are due to market price movements. Management does not
believe any remaining unrealized losses represent
other-than-temporary impairments based on our evaluation of
available evidence as of June 30, 2012.

At June 30, 2012 and
2011, the recorded bases of common and preferred stock and other
investments that are restricted for more than one year or are not
publicly traded were $313 million and $334 million, respectively.
These investments are carried at cost and are reviewed quarterly
for indicators of other-than-temporary impairment. It is not
possible for us to reliably estimate the fair value of these
investments.
