Skype

On October 13, 2011, we acquired all of the issued and outstanding shares of 
Skype Global S.á r. l. (“ Skype”), a leading global provider of software 
applications and related Internet communications products based in Luxembourg, 
for $8.6 billion, primarily in cash. The major classes of assets and liabilities
to which we allocated the purchase price were goodwill of $7.1 billion, 
identifiable intangible assets of $1.6 billion, and unearned revenue of $222 
million. The goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition is primarily
attributable to our expectation of extending Skype’s brand and the reach of its 
networked platform, while enhancing Microsoft’s existing portfolio of real-time 
communications products and services. We assigned the goodwill to the following 
segments: $4.2 billion to Entertainment and Devices Division, $2.8 billion to 
Microsoft Business Division, and $54 million to Online Services Division. Skype 
was consolidated into our results of operations starting October 13, 2011, the 
acquisition date.

Following are the details of the purchase price allocated to the intangible 
assets acquired:
