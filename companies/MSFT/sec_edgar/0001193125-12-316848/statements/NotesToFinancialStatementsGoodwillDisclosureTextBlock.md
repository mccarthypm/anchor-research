GOODWILL

Changes in the carrying
amount of goodwill by segment were as follows:

The measurement periods
for purchase price allocations end as soon as information on the
facts and circumstances becomes available, but do not exceed 12
months. Adjustments in purchase price allocations may require a
recasting of the amounts allocated to goodwill retroactive to the
periods in which the acquisitions occurred.

Any change in the
goodwill amounts resulting from foreign currency translations are
presented as “other” in the above table. Also included
within “other” are business dispositions and transfers
between business segments due to reorganizations, as applicable.
For fiscal year 2012, a $6.2 billion goodwill impairment charge is
included in “other,” as discussed further below. This
goodwill impairment charge also represents our accumulated goodwill
impairment as of June 30, 2012.

Goodwill Impairment

We tested goodwill for
impairment as of May 1, 2012 at the reporting unit level using
a discounted cash flow methodology with a peer-based, risk-adjusted
weighted average cost of capital. We believe use of a discounted
cash flow approach is the most reliable indicator of the fair
values of the businesses.

Upon completion of the
annual test, OSD goodwill was determined to be impaired. The
impairment was the result of the OSD unit experiencing slower than
projected growth in search queries and search advertising revenue
per query, slower growth in display revenue, and changes in the
timing and implementation of certain initiatives designed to drive
search and display revenue growth in the future. Although revenues
increased compared to the prior year, the industry is highly
competitive and certain operational challenges have affected our
expectations such that future growth and profitability are lower
than previous estimates. In addition, in the current year, we added
a business-specific risk factor to the weighted average cost of
capital used to calculate the discounted cash flows of OSD in
estimating the fair value of the business. This business-specific
risk factor reflects the increased uncertainty in forecasting
the future performance of OSD.

Because our annual test
indicated that OSD’s carrying value exceeded its estimated
fair value, a second phase of the goodwill impairment test
(“ Step 2”) was performed specific to OSD. Under Step 2,
the fair value of all OSD assets and liabilities were estimated,
including tangible assets, existing technology, trade names, and
partner relationships for the purpose of deriving an estimate of
the implied fair value of goodwill. The implied fair value of the
goodwill was then compared to the recorded goodwill to determine
the amount of the impairment. Assumptions used in measuring the
value of these assets and liabilities included the discount rates,
royalty rates, and obsolescence rates used in valuing the
intangible assets, and pricing of comparable transactions in the
market in valuing the tangible assets.

No other instances of
impairment were identified in our May 1, 2012 test.
