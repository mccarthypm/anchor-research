We have committed $353
million for constructing new buildings, building improvements, and

certain equipment. Rental expense for facilities operating leases
was $639 million, $525 million, and $530 million, in fiscal years
2012, 2011, and 2010, respectively. Future minimum rental
commitments under noncancellable facilities operating leases in

Indemnifications

We provide
indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers
against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third
parties arising from the use of our products and certain other
matters. We evaluate estimated losses for these indemnifications,
and we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an
unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate
of the amount of loss. To date, we have not encountered significant
costs as a result of these obligations and have not accrued any
liabilities related to these indemnifications in our financial
statements.

Yahoo! Commercial
Agreement

On December 4, 2009,
we entered into a 10-year agreement with Yahoo! Inc.
(“ Yahoo!”) whereby Microsoft will provide the exclusive
algorithmic and paid search platform for Yahoo! websites. Microsoft
provided Yahoo! with revenue per search guarantees for a period of
18 months after implementation of the Microsoft search ads platform
in each country, extended by an additional 12 months for the U. S.
and Canada. These guarantees are calculated, paid, and adjusted
periodically and are rate guarantees, not guarantees of search
volume. We estimate the remaining cost of the revenue per search
guarantees during the guarantee period could range up to $120
million.
