Antitrust, Unfair Competition, and Overcharge Class Actions

A large number of antitrust and unfair competition class action lawsuits were 
filed against us in various state, federal, and Canadian courts on behalf of 
various classes of direct and indirect purchasers of our PC operating system and
certain other software products between 1999 and 2005. We obtained dismissals or
reached settlements of all claims made in the United States.

All settlements in the United States have received final court approval. Under 
the settlements, generally class members can obtain vouchers that entitle them 
to be reimbursed for purchases of a wide variety of platform-neutral computer 
hardware and software. The total value of vouchers that we may issue varies by 
state. We will make available to certain schools a percentage of those vouchers 
that are not issued or claimed (one-half to two-thirds depending on the state). 
The total value of vouchers we ultimately issue will depend on the number of 
class members who make claims and are issued vouchers. The maximum value of 
vouchers to be issued is approximately $2.7 billion. The actual costs of these 
settlements will be less than that maximum amount, depending on the number of 
class members and schools that are issued and redeem vouchers. We estimate the 
total cost to resolve all of the state overcharge class action cases will range 
between $1.9 billion and $2.0 billion. At June 30, 2012, we have recorded a 
liability related to these claims of approximately $500 million, which reflects 
our estimated exposure of $1.9 billion less payments made to date of 
approximately $1.4 billion mostly for vouchers, legal fees, and administrative 
expenses.

The three cases pending in British Columbia, Ontario, and Quebec, Canada have 
not been settled. In March 2010, the court in the British Columbia case 
certified it as a class action. In April 2011, the British Columbia Court of 
Appeal reversed the class certification ruling and dismissed the case, holding 
that indirect purchasers do not have a claim. The plaintiffs have appealed to 
the Canadian Supreme Court, which will be heard in the fall of 2012. The other 
two actions have been stayed.

Other Antitrust Litigation and Claims

In November 2004, Novell, Inc. (“ Novell”) filed a complaint in U. S. District 
Court for the District of Utah (later transferred to federal court in Maryland),
asserting antitrust and unfair competition claims against us related to Novell’s
ownership of WordPerfect and other productivity applications during the period 
between June 1994 and March 1996. In June 2005, the trial court granted our 
motion to dismiss four of six claims of the complaint. In March 2010, the trial 
court granted summary judgment in favor of Microsoft as to all remaining claims.
The court of appeals reversed that ruling as to one claim. Trial of that claim 
took place from October to December 2011 and resulted in a mistrial because the 
jury was unable to reach a verdict. In July 2012, the trial court granted 
Microsoft’s motion for judgment as a matter of law. Novell may appeal this 
decision.

Government Competition Law Matters

In December 2009, the European Commission adopted a decision that rendered 
legally binding commitments offered by Microsoft to address the Commission’s 
concerns about the inclusion of Web browsing software in Windows. Among other 
things, Microsoft committed to display a “ Browser Choice Screen” on 
Windows-based PCs in Europe where Internet Explorer is set as the default 
browser. Due to a technical error, we failed to deliver the requisite software 
to enable that display to PCs that came preinstalled with a version of Windows 7
called Windows 7 Service Pack 1. We did deliver the requisite software to PCs 
running the original version of Windows 7 and earlier editions of Windows. 
Following notification by the Commission of reports that some PCs were not 
receiving the update, we promptly fixed the error and advised the Commission of 
what we had discovered. PCs that come preinstalled with Windows 7 Service Pack 
are now receiving the Browser Choice Screen software, as intended. On July 17, 
2012, the Commission announced that it had opened proceedings to investigate 
whether Microsoft had failed to comply with this commitment. The Commission 
stated that if a company is found to have breached a legally binding commitment,
the company may be fined up to 10% of its worldwide annual revenue.

Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

Motorola Litigation

In October 2010, Microsoft filed patent infringement complaints against Motorola
Mobility (“ Motorola”) with the International Trade Commission (“ ITC”) and in 
U. S. District Court in Seattle for infringement of nine Microsoft patents by 
Motorola’s Android devices. Since then, Microsoft and Motorola have filed 
additional claims against each other in the ITC, in federal district courts in 
Seattle, Wisconsin, Florida, and California, and in courts in Germany and the 
United Kingdom. In April 2012, following complaints by Microsoft and Apple, the 
European Union’s competition office opened two antitrust investigations against 
Motorola to determine whether it has abused certain of its standard essential 
patents to distort competition in breach of European Union antitrust rules. In 
June 2012, we received a request for information from the U. S. Federal Trade 
Commission (“ FTC”) apparently related to an FTC investigation into whether 
Motorola’s conduct violates U. S. law. The nature of the claims asserted and 
status of individual matters are summarized below.

International Trade Commission

The hearing in Microsoft’s ITC case against Motorola took place in August 2011 
on seven of the nine patents originally asserted in the complaint. In December 
2011, the administrative law judge (“ ALJ”) issued an initial determination that
Motorola infringed one Microsoft patent, and recommended that the ITC issue a 
limited exclusion order against Motorola prohibiting importation of infringing 
Motorola Android devices. In May 2012, the ITC issued the limited exclusion 
order recommended by the ALJ, which became effective on July 18, 2012. Microsoft
has appealed certain aspects of the ITC ruling adverse to Microsoft; Motorola is
expected to appeal the ITC exclusion order.

In November 2010, Motorola filed an action against Microsoft in the ITC alleging
infringement of five Motorola patents by Xbox consoles and accessories and 
seeking an exclusion order to prohibit importation of the allegedly infringing 
Xbox products into the U. S. In April 2012, the ALJ found that Xbox products 
infringe four of the five patents asserted by Motorola. The ALJ subsequently 
recommended that the ITC issue a limited exclusion order and a cease and desist 
order. Both Microsoft and Motorola sought ITC review of the ALJ’s findings. In 
June 2012, Microsoft filed a motion to terminate the investigation as to certain
patents based on facts arising as the result of Google’s acquisition of 
Motorola. The ITC determined that it would review the ALJ’s initial 
determination in its entirety and remanded the matter to the ALJ (1) to apply 
certain ITC case precedent, (2) to rule on Microsoft’s June 2012 motion to 
terminate, and (3) set a new target date for completion of the investigation. If
the ITC issues an exclusion order or cease and desist order, it will be subject 
to Presidential review for up to 60 days, during which it is expected that 
Microsoft could import Xbox products subject to posting a bond. Should any order
issue and survive Presidential review, Microsoft may be able to mitigate its 
impact by altering Xbox products so they do not infringe the Motorola patents.

U. S. District Court

The SeattleDistrict Court case filed in October 2010 by Microsoft as a companion
to Microsoft’s ITC case against Motorola has been stayed pending the outcome of 
Microsoft’s ITC case.

In November 2010, Microsoft sued Motorola for breach of contract in U. S. 
District Court in Seattle, alleging that Motorola breached its commitments to 
standards-setting organizations to license to Microsoft certain patents on 
reasonable and non-discriminatory (“ RAND”) terms and conditions. Motorola has 
declared these patents essential to the implementation of the H.264 video 
standard and the 802.11 Wi-Fi standard. In suits described below, Motorola or a 
Motorola affiliate subsequently sued Microsoft on those patents in U. S. 
District Courts, in the ITC, and in Germany. In February 2012, the Seattle 
District Court granted a partial summary judgment in favor of Microsoft ruling 
that (1) Motorola entered into binding contractual commitments with standards 
organizations committing to license its declared-essential patents on RAND terms
and conditions; and (2) Microsoft is a third-party beneficiary of those 
commitments. Subsequently, the court rejected Motorola’s argument that Microsoft
had repudiated its right to a RAND license, and ruled a trial is needed to 
determine whether Motorola is in breach of its obligation to enter into a patent
license with Microsoft and, if so, the amount of the RAND royalty. In April 
2012, the court issued a temporary restraining order preventing Motorola from 
taking steps to enforce an injunction in Germany relating to the H.264 video 
patents. In May 2012, the court converted that order into a preliminary 
injunction. Motorola has appealed the court’s injunction orders to the Court of 
Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. The Seattle court has set a trial to determine 
the RAND royalty to begin in November 2012.

Cases filed by Motorola in Wisconsin, California, and Florida, with the 
exception of one currently stayed case in Wisconsin (a companion case to 
Motorola’s ITC action), have been transferred at Microsoft’s request to the U. S
District Court in Seattle. Motorola and Microsoft both seek damages as well as 
injunctive relief. No trial dates have been set in any of the transferred cases,
and the parties have agreed to a stay of these cases.

Microsoft products including Windows Mobile 6.5 and Windows Phone 7, Windows 
Marketplace, Silverlight, Windows Vista ...

  In counterclaims in the patent actions brought by Motorola, Microsoft asserts

digital video recorders.  

Germany

In July 2011, Motorola filed patent infringement actions in Germany against 
Microsoft and several Microsoft subsidiaries.

  Two of the patents are asserted by Motorola to be essential to implementation 
of the H.264 video standard, and Motorola alleges that H.264 capable products 
including Xbox 360, Windows 7, Media ...

In lawsuits Microsoft filed in Germany in September, October, and December 2011 
and in April 2012, Microsoft asserts Motorola Android devices infringe Microsoft
patents. Microsoft seeks damages and an injunction. In May 2012, the court 
issued an injunction on one patent against Motorola Android devices in Germany 
and ruled against Microsoft on a second patent. If the court rules in favor of 
Microsoft in a given case, an injunction could be issued immediately relating to
the sale of the infringing devices in Germany, which Microsoft could then take 
steps to enforce. Damages would be determined in later proceedings. Motorola has
appealed the first instance court’s ruling in Microsoft’s favor.

United Kingdom

In December 2011, Microsoft filed an action against Motorola in the High Court 
of Justice, Chancery Division, Patents Court, in London, England, seeking to 
revoke the UK part of the European patent asserted by Motorola in Germany 
against the ActiveSync protocol. In February 2012, Motorola counterclaimed 
alleging infringement of the patent and seeking damages and an injunction. A 
trial is expected in December 2012.

Other Patent and Intellectual Property Claims

In addition to these cases, there are approximately 60 other patent infringement
cases pending against Microsoft.

Other

We also are subject to a variety of other claims and suits that arise from time 
to time in the ordinary course of our business. Although management currently 
believes that resolving claims against us, individually or in aggregate, will 
not have a material adverse impact on our financial statements, these matters 
are subject to inherent uncertainties and management’s view of these matters may
change in the future.

As of June 30, 2012, we had accrued aggregate liabilities of $384 million in 
other current liabilities and $220 million in other long-term liabilities for 
all of our contingent legal matters. While we intend to defend these matters 
vigorously, adverse outcomes that we estimate could reach approximately $550 
million in aggregate beyond recorded amounts are reasonably possible. Were 
unfavorable final outcomes to occur, there exists the possibility of a material 
adverse impact on our financial statements for the period in which the effects 
become reasonably estimable.
