We grant stock-based compensation to directors and employees. At June 30, 2012, 
an aggregate of 507 million shares were authorized for future grant under our 
stock plans, covering stock options, stock awards, and shared performance stock 
awards, and excluding shares reserved for issuance under our employee stock 
purchase plan. Awards that expire or are canceled without delivery of shares 
generally become available for issuance under the plans. We issue new shares of 
Microsoft common stock to satisfy exercises and vestings of awards granted under
all of our stock plans.

Stock-based compensation expense and related income tax benefits were as

Stock Plans (Excluding Stock Options)

Stock awards

Stock awards (“ SAs”) are grants that entitle the holder to shares of Microsoft 
common stock as the award vests. Our SAs generally vest over a five-year period.

Shared performance stock awards

Shared performance stock awards (“ SPSAs”) are a form of SA in which the number 
of shares ultimately received depends on our business performance against 
specified performance targets.

We granted SPSAs for fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010 with performance periods 
of July 1, 2011 through June 30, 2012, July 1, 2010 through June 30, 2011, and 
July 1, 2009 through June 30, 2010, respectively. In August following the end of
each performance period, the number of shares of stock subject to the award is 
determined by multiplying the target award by a percentage ranging from 0% to 
150%. The percentage is based on performance metrics for the performance period,
as determined by the Compensation Committee of the Board of Directors in its 
sole discretion. An additional number of shares, approximately 12% of the total 
target SPSAs, are available as additional awards to participants based on 
individual performance. One-quarter of the shares of stock subject to each award
vest following the end of the performance period, and an additional one-quarter 
of the shares vest on each of the following three anniversaries of the grant 
date.

Executive officer incentive plan

Under the Executive Officer Incentive Plan (“ EOIP”), the Compensation Committee
awards performance-based compensation to executive officers for specified 
performance periods. During the periods reported, executive officers were 
eligible to receive annual awards comprising cash and SAs from an aggregate 
incentive pool equal to a percentage of consolidated operating income. For 
fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, the pool was 0.3%, 0.25%, and 0.45% of 
operating income, respectively.

In September following the end of the fiscal year, each executive officer may 
receive a combined cash and SA award with a total value equal to a fixed 
percentage of the aggregate pool. The fixed percentage ranges between 0% and 
150% of a target based on an assessment of the executive officer’s performance 
during the prior fiscal year. Following approval of the awards, 20% of the award
is payable to the executive officers in cash, and the remaining 80% is converted
into an SA for shares of Microsoft common stock. The number of shares subject to
the SA portion of the award is determined by dividing the value of 80% of the 
total award by the closing price of Microsoft common stock on the last business 
day in August of each year. The SA portion of the award vests one-quarter 
immediately after the award is approved following fiscal year-end and 
one-quarter on August 31 of each of the following three years.

Activity for all stock plans

The fair value of each award was estimated on the date of grant using the 
following assumptions:

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

We have an employee stock purchase plan (the “ Plan”) for all eligible 
employees. Shares of our common stock may be purchased by employees at 
three-month intervals at 90% of the fair market value on the last trading day of
each three-month period. Employees may purchase shares having a value not 
exceeding 15% of their gross compensation during an offering period. Under the 
terms of the Plan that were approved in 2002, the Plan will terminate on 
December 31, 2012. Microsoft intends to request shareholder approval to renew 
the Plan and reserve additional shares for issuance under the Plan before 
December 31, 2012. Employees purchased the following shares during the periods 
presented:

At June 30, 2012, 23 million shares of our common stock were reserved for future
issuance through the Plan.

Savings Plan

We have a savings plan in the U. S. that qualifies under Section 401(k) of the 
Internal Revenue Code, and a number of savings plans in international locations.
Participating U. S. employees may contribute up to 50% of their salary, but not 
more than statutory limits. We contribute fifty cents for each dollar a 
participant contributes in this plan, with a maximum contribution of 3% of a 
participant’s earnings. Matching contributions for all plans were $373 million, 
$282 million, and $275 million in fiscal years 2012, 2011, and 2010, 
respectively, and were expensed as contributed. Matching contributions are 
invested proportionate to each participant’s voluntary contributions in the 
investment options provided under the plan. Investment options in the U. S. plan
include Microsoft common stock, but neither participant nor our matching 
contributions are required to be invested in Microsoft common stock.
