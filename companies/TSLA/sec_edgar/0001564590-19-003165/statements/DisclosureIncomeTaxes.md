On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“ Tax Act”) was enacted 
into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes 
include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% 
to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U. S. 
international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a
one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign 
earnings. We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the
period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U. S. deferred tax assets and 
liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax 
assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on 
the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to
our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our 
net U. S. deferred tax assets.

In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff 
Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act (“ SAB 118”), which allowed us to record provisional amounts during
a measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. As 
such, in accordance with SAB 118, we completed our analysis during the fourth 
quarter of 2018 considering current legislation and guidance resulting in no 
material adjustments from the provisional amounts recorded during the prior 
year.

As of December 31, 2018, we recorded a valuation allowance of $1.81 billion for 
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $38.1 million, 
increased by $821.0 million, and increased by $354.3 million during the years 
ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. The changes in valuation 
allowance are primarily due to additional U. S. deferred tax assets and 
liabilities incurred in the respective year. The 2017 additional U. S. deferred 
tax assets are net of re-measurement from 35% to 21% as a result of the Tax Act.
There have been no material releases of the valuation allowance. Management 
believes that based on the available information, it is more likely than not 
that the U. S. deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a full 
valuation allowance is required against all U. S. deferred tax assets. We have 
net $30.2 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which 
management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the 
expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.

  (2)      Due to the Tax Act, our U. S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as 
of December 31, 2017 were re-measured from 35% to 21%. The change in tax rate 
resulted in a decrease to our gross U. S. defe...  

As of December 31, 2018, we had $7.30 billion of federal and $5.37 billion of 
state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable 
income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 
2028 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity 
prior to our acquisition in 2016 and, therefore, are subject to change of 
control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can 
be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control 
limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.

As of December 31, 2018, we had research and development tax credits of $256.1 
million and $276.2 million for federal and state income tax purposes, 
respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits 
will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state research 
and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we
have other general business tax credits of $126.8 million for federal income tax
purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.

Collectively, we had no foreign earnings as of December 31, 2018 and therefore 
was not subject to the mandatory repatriation tax provisions of the Tax Act. 
However, some of our foreign subsidiaries do have accumulated earnings. No 
deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded 
relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred 
tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change”, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have 
determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of 
our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership 
changes.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in 
thousands):

  December 31, 2015                                               99,127

  Decrease in balances related to prior year tax positions       (31,493  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax               84,352  
  Change in balances related to effect of U. S. tax law          (58,050  
  December 31, 2017                                              198,745  
  Decrease in balances related to prior year tax positions        (6,347  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax               60,960  
  December 31, 2018                                              253,357  

As of December 31, 2018, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial. 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $243.8 million, if recognized, would not affect our
effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset 
that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance.

We file income tax returns in the U. S., California and various state and 
foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 
years 2015 and 2016. Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2017 remain 
subject to examination for federal income tax purposes, and tax years 2004 to 
2017 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes. All net 
operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for
U. S. federal and California income tax purposes. Tax years 2008 to 2017 remain 
subject to examination in other U. S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

The potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to 
unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. However, we cannot 
reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time.

The U. S. Tax Court issued a decision inAltera Corp v. Commissionerrelated to 
the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing arrangement.
As this decision can be overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any impact 
as of December 31, 2018. In addition, any potential tax benefits would increase 
our U. S. deferred tax asset, which is currently offset with a full valuation 
allowance.
