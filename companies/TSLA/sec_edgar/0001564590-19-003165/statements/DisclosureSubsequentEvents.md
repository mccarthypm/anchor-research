On February 3, 2019, we entered into a definitive agreement to acquire Maxwell 
Technologies, Inc. (“ Maxwell”). Pursuant to the definitive agreement, each 
issued and outstanding share of Maxwell common stock will be exchanged for a 
fraction of a share of our common stock equal to the lesser of: (i) $4.75 
divided by an average value of one share of our common stock as calculated 
pursuant to the definitive agreement, and (ii) 0.0193, provided that cash will 
be paid in lieu of any fractional shares of our common stock. The closing of the
transaction is subject to the successful tender of a specified minimum number of
Maxwell common stock in an exchange offer to be commenced by our wholly-owned 
subsidiary, certain regulatory approvals and customary closing conditions.
