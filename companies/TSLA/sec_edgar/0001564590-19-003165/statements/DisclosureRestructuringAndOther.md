During 2018, we carried-out certain restructuring actions in order to reduce 
costs and improve efficiency and recognized $36.6 million of employee 
termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a certain facility. 
The employee termination cash expenses of $27.3 million were substantially paid 
by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were non-cash. Also included 
within restructuring and other activities was $55.2 million of expenses 
(materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring the energy generation
and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of certain tangible assets, 
the shortening of the useful life of a trade name intangible asset and a 
contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded that a small portion of 
the IPR& D asset is not commercially feasible. Consequently, we recognized an 
impairment loss of $13.3 million (see Note 4, Intangible Assets).

In October 2018, a final court order was entered approving the terms of a 
settlement in connection with the SEC’s legal actions relating to Elon Musk’s 
prior consideration during the third quarter of 2018 of a take-private proposal 
for Tesla. Consequently, we recognized settlement and legal expenses of $30.1 
million in the year ended December 31, 2018 (see Note 17, Commitments and 
Contingencies). These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018.
