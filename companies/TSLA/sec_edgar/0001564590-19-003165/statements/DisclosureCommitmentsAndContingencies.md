Non-Cancellable Leases

We have entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements for 
certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and 
service locations, equipment, vehicles, solar energy systems and Supercharger 
sites, throughout the world. Included within the lease commitment table below 
are payments due under operating leases that have been accounted for as 
build-to-suit lease arrangements, which are included in property, plant and 
equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. Rent expense for the years 
endedDecember 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016 was $182.6million, $177.7million and 
$116.8million, respectively.

We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases 
up to 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease 
obligations and are included within property, plant and equipment on the 
consolidated balance sheets.

Future minimum commitments for leases as ofDecember 31, 2018were as follows (in 
thousands):

Build-to-Suit Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

We have a build-to-suit lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the 
State University of New York (the “ SUNY Foundation”) where the SUNY Foundation 
will construct a solar cell and panel manufacturing facility, referred to as 
Gigafactory 2, with our participation in the design and construction, install 
certain utilities and other improvements and acquire certain manufacturing 
equipment designated by us to be used in the manufacturing facility. The SUNY 
Foundation covers (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing facility 
up to $350.0 million, (ii) the acquisition and commissioning of the 
manufacturing equipment in an amount up to $274.7 million and (iii) $125.3 
million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) only, 
subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of New York; and we are
responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts. 
The SUNY Foundation will own the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing 
equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation. Following completion of the 
manufacturing facility, we will lease the manufacturing facility and the 
manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10
years, with an option to renew, for $2.00 per year plus utilities. During the 
three months endedMarch 31, 2018, we began production at the manufacturing 
facility, although construction has not been fully completed as of December 31, 
2018.

Under the terms of the build-to-suit lease arrangement, we are required to 
achieve specific operational milestones during the initial lease term; which 
include employing a certain number of employees at the manufacturing facility, 
within western New York and within the State of New York within specified 
periods following the completion of the manufacturing facility. We are also 
required to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational 
expenses and other costs in the State of New York within 10 years following the 
achievement of full production. On an annual basis during the initial lease 
term, as measured on each anniversary of the commissioning of the manufacturing 
facility, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation 
requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41.2 million “program 
payment” to theSUNYFoundation for each year that we fail to meet these 
requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material 
breach by us, then additional amounts might become payable by us.

The non-cash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement 
during the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017 amounted to $8.0 million and 
$86.1 million. The non-cash investing and financing activities related to the 
arrangement from the Acquisition Date through December 31, 2016 amounted to $5.6
million.

Environmental Liabilities

In connection with our factory located in Fremont, California, we are obligated 
to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the 
time we purchased the property from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (“ 
NUMMI”). In particular, we are responsible for the first $15.0 million of 
remediation costs, any remediation costs in excess of $30.0 million and any 
remediation costs incurred after 10 years from the purchase date. NUMMI is 
responsible for any remediation costs between $15.0 million and $30.0 million 
for up to 10 years after the purchase date.

Legal Proceedings

Securities Litigation Relating to SolarCity’s Financial Statements and Guidance

On March28, 2014, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U. S. 
District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity and two
of its officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities laws and
seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a purported
class of purchasers of SolarCity’s securities from March6, 2013 to March18, 
2014. After a series of amendments to the original complaint, the District Court
dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in our favor on August9, 
2016. The plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal, and on December4, 2017, the Court
heard oral argument on the appeal. On March8, 2018, the Court upheld the 
District Court ruling of dismissal and judgment in our favor. The case is 
concluded.

Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, sevenlawsuits were filed in the 
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla 
challenging our acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit 
names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then 
constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their 
fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both 
derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, 
among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. On
January27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. 
Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended 
complaint. On March17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended 
complaint. On December13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. On 
March28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed 
a request for interlocutory appeal, but the Delaware Supreme Court denied that 
request, electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of the case. 
Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018. The parties are proceeding with 
discovery. The case is set for trial in March 2020.

These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U. S. District Court 
for the District of Delaware on April21, 2017. Those actions have been 
consolidated and are stayed pending the Chancery Court litigation. They include 
claims for violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary 
duties by Tesla’s board of directors. That action is stayed pending the Chancery
Court litigation.

We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit 
and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the 
possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.

Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles

On October10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U. S. 
District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its
current officers, and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of 
federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other 
relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from 
May4, 2016 to October6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made 
materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s preparedness 
to produce Model 3 vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March23, 
2018, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May25, 2018. The court granted
defendant’s motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed their 
amended complaint on September 28, 2018. We will file a motion to dismiss the 
amended complaint on February 15, 2019. The hearing on the motion to dismiss is 
set for March 1, 2019. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend 
to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the 
possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

On October 26, 2018, in a similar action, a purported stockholder class action 
was filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against 
Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities 
by Tesla in August 2017. The complaint alleges misrepresentations made by Tesla 
regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of
2017 in connection with such offering, and seeks unspecified compensatory 
damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla 
securities in such offering. Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court.
On January 22, 2019, plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court, 
instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial 
purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the U. S. District 
Court for the Northern District of California who is hearing the 
above-referenced earlier filed federal court case. On February 5, 2019, the 
Court stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss the 
complaint in the above earlier filed case. We believe that the claims are 
without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are 
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with 
this lawsuit.

Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award

On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and 
derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the 
members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging that such 
board members breached their fiduciary duties by approving the stock-based 
compensation plan. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and
rescission or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 
2018, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its 
opposition brief on November 1, 2018 and defendants filed a reply brief on 
December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss is set for May 9, 2019. 
We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to 
defend against them vigorously.

Securities Litigation related to Potential Going Private Transaction

Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class 
actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Elon Musk’s 
August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of
the suits are now pending in the United States District Court for the Northern 
District of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they 
each purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related 
to Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other 
relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. 
Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as 
defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. Defendants plan to file a 
motion to dismiss the complaint on or before March 7, 2019. The hearing on the 
motion to dismiss is tentatively set for June 20, 2019. We believe that the 
claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable
to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated with these claims.

Between October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were 
filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the members of 
Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made 
and actions connected to a potential going private transaction. These cases have
been stayed pending resolution of the stockholder class action. In addition to 
these cases, on October 25, 2018, another derivative lawsuit was filed in 
federal court in Delaware against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of
directors as then constituted, and the parties have agreed to also stay this 
case pending resolution of the stockholder class action; the parties’ proposed 
stipulation regarding the stay is pending with the Court. We believe that the 
claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. The Company 
is unable to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, associated with 
these claims.

Settlement with SEC related to Potential Going Private Transaction

On October 16, 2018, the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the
Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the U. S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “ SEC”) relating to Elon Musk’s prior 
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. Without admitting or 
denying any of the SEC’s allegations, and with no restriction on Mr. Musk’s 
ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board (other than as its 
Chair), among other things, we and Mr. Musk paid civil penalties of $20 million 
each and agreed thatan independent director will serve as Chair of the Board for
at least three years, and we appointed such an independent Chair of the Board 
and two additional independent directors to the Board, and further enhanced our 
disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters.

Certain Investigations and Other Matters

We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental 
authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“ 
DOJ”) and various state, federal and international agencies. We routinely 
cooperate with such regulatory and governmental requests.

In particular, the SEC has issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Mr. 
Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private and (b) 
certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and 
other public statements relating to Model 3 production. The DOJ has also asked 
us to voluntarily provide it with information about each of these matters and is
investigating. Aside from the settlement with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s 
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any 
developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge 
no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any 
wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been cooperating and 
will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the 
outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue
an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact
on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial 
position.

We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise 
from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or 
development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse 
impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial 
position and brand.

Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns

We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any 
losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from 
reductions in U. S. Treasury grants or ITCs. Generally, such obligations would 
arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy 
systems as assessed by the U. S. Treasury Department for purposes of claiming U.
S. Treasury grants or as assessed by the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or U.
S. Treasury grants. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when 
applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this 
obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any 
guidelines issued by the U. S. Treasury Department on solar energy system 
valuations for purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants and any audits 
undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in 
excess of the amounts already recognized by us, which were immaterial, for this 
obligation are not probable based on the facts known at the filing date.

The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this 
obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar 
energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the 
values that the U. S. Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the 
systems for purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants or the values the IRS 
would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs 
or U. S. Treasury grants. We claim U. S. Treasury grants based on guidelines 
provided by the U. S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the
IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent 
third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs 
that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot 
determine future revisions to U. S. Treasury Department guidelines governing 
solar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in 
claiming ITCs or U. S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably estimate the 
maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this 
obligation as of each balance sheet date.

We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are 
associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can 
be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or 
the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one 
state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the 
tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives 
received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the 
contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to 
indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in 
the amount of state or local incentives actually received.

Our lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset 
mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy systems in a 
fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to refund master lease 
prepayments previously received from investors. Any refunds of master lease 
prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.

Letters of Credit

As ofDecember 31, 2018, we had $219.6million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
