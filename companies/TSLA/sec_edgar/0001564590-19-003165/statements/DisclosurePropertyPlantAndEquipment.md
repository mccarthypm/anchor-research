Construction in progress is primarily comprised of tooling and equipment related
to the manufacturing of our vehicles and a portion of Gigafactory 1 
construction. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset 
classes, and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use. 
Construction in progress also includes certain build-to-suit lease costs 
incurred at our Buffalo manufacturing facility, referred to as Gigafactory 2. 
During the year ended December 31, 2018, we had significant transfers from 
construction in progress to the various property, plant and equipment asset 
classes as assets were placed in service primarily at Gigafactory 1 and 
Gigafactory 2. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized during periods of 
significant capital asset construction and amortized over the useful lives of 
the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2018 and 2017, we 
capitalized $54.9 million and $124.9 million, respectively, of interest.

As ofDecember 31, 2018and 2017, the table above included $1.69 billion and $1.63
billion, respectively, of gross build-to-suit lease assets. As ofDecember 31, 
2018and 2017, the corresponding financing liabilities of $81.7 million and $14.9
million, respectively, were recorded in accrued liabilities and $1.66 billion 
and $1.67 billion, respectively, were recorded in other long-term liabilities on
the consolidated balance sheets.

Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016 was
$1.11 billion, $769.3 million and $477.3 million, respectively. Gross property 
and equipment under capital leases as ofDecember 31, 2018and 2017 was $1.52 
billion and $688.3 million, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on property 
and equipment under capital leases as of these dates was $231.6 million and 
$100.6 million, respectively.

Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory 1 with investments in the 
production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery 
cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output
from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As these terms convey to 
us the right to use, as defined in ASC 840, Leases, their production equipment, 
we consider them to be leased assets when production commences. This results in 
us recording the cost of their production equipment within property, plant and 
equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding 
liability recorded to long-term debt and capital leases. For all suppliers and 
partners for which we plan to purchase the full output from their production 
equipment located at Gigafactory 1, we have applied similar accounting. As of 
December 31, 2018and 2017, we had cumulatively capitalized costs of $1.24 
billion and $473.3 million, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in 
relation to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement. We had 
cumulatively capitalized total costs for Gigafactory 1, including costs under 
our Panasonic arrangement, of $4.62 billion and $3.15 billion as ofDecember 31, 
2018and 2017, respectively.
