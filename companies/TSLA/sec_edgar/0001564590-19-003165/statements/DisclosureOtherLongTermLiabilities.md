The liability for receipts from an investor represents the amounts received from
the investor under a lease pass-through fund arrangement for the monetization of
ITCs for solar energy systems not yet placed in service. Due to the adoption of 
the new revenue standard, automotive sales with resale value guarantees that are
now accounted for as sales with a right of return require a corresponding sales 
return reserve, which is included in accrued liabilities and other when the 
reserve is current and other long-term liabilities when the reserve is 
non-current on the consolidated balance sheets.
