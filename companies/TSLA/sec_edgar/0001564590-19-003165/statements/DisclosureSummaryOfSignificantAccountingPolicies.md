Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“ GAAP”) and 
reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we 
have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ ASC”) 810, Consolidation, we consolidate 
any variable interest entity (“ VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. 
We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in
order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes 
associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing
programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership 
is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a 
controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through
arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires 
a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to 
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s 
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the 
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a 
VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered 
the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
of a number of VIEs (see Note18, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We 
evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that 
we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and 
balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current 
period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the 
accompanying notes as a result of the adoption of the Accounting Standards 
Update (“ ASU”) 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: Restricted Cash.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Estimates are 
used for, but not limited to, determining the transaction price of products and 
services in arrangements with multiple performance obligations and determining 
the amortization period of these obligations, significant economic incentive for
residual value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability
of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, 
goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, residual value of operating lease
vehicles, depreciable lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems, 
fair value and residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases, 
warranty liabilities, income taxes, contingencies, the accrued liability for 
solar energy system performance guarantees, determining lease pass-through 
financing obligations, the discount rates used to determine the fair value of 
investment tax credits, the valuation of build-to-suit lease assets, fair value 
of interest rate swaps and inputs used to value stock-based compensation. In 
addition, estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting for business 
combinations, including the fair values and useful lives of acquired assets, 
assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests. Management bases its estimates
on historical experience and on various other assumptions believed to be 
reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the 
carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.

RevenueRecognition

Adoption of new accounting standards

ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On January 1, 
2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers and all the related amendments (“new revenue standard”) using the
modified retrospective method. As a policy election, the new revenue standard 
was applied only to contracts that were not substantially completed as of the 
date of adoption. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the 
new revenue standard as an adjustment to the January 1, 2018 opening balance of 
accumulated deficit. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not
been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting 
standards in effect for those periods.

A majority of our automotive sales revenue is recognized when control transfers 
upon delivery to customers. For certain vehicle sales where revenue was 
previously deferred as an in-substance operating lease, such as certain vehicle 
sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, we now 
recognize revenue when the vehicles are shipped as a sale with a right of 
return. As a result, the corresponding operating lease asset, deferred revenue, 
and resale value guarantee balances as of December 31, 2017, were reclassified 
to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry. Furthermore, the warranty 
liability related to such vehicles has been accrued as a result of the change 
from in-substance operating leases to vehicle sales. Prepayments on contracts 
that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance
plans, have been reclassified from deferred revenue to customer deposits. Refer 
to theAutomotive RevenueandAutomotive Leasing Revenuesections below for further 
discussion of the impact on various categories of vehicle sales.

Following the adoption of the new revenue standard, the revenue recognition for 
our other sales arrangements, including sales of solar energy systems, energy 
storage products, services, and sales of used vehicles, remained consistent with
our historical revenue recognition policy. Under our lease pass-through fund 
arrangements, we do not have any further performance obligations and therefore 
reclassified all investment tax credit (“ ITC”) deferred revenue as of December 
31, 2017, to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry. The 
corresponding effects of the changes to lease pass-through fund arrangements are
also reflected in our non-controlling interests in subsidiaries. Additionally, 
we have considered the impact from any new revenue arrangements in the current 
year that would have been accounted for differently under ASC 605, Revenue 
Recognition, as an adjustment from adoption of the new revenue standard.

Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated 
January 1, 2018 consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the new revenue 
standard was as follows (in thousands):

on our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2018
was an increase in collateralized lease repayments of $474.2 million, from a net
financing cash outflow of $84.9 million to a net financing cash outflow of 
$559.2 million as presented, with an offsetting increase to cash outflows from 
operations. Additionally, the adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet, 
consolidated statement of operations and consolidated statement of comprehensive
income (loss) identified above would have corresponding impacts within the 
operating section of the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales Revenue

Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new 
vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet the definition of a
performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including access to our 
Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and 
over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon 
delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. 
Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance 
with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such 
as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air 
software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and 
recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready 
obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue 
related to these other features and services over the performance period, which 
is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life 
of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and full self-driving features is 
recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our obligations 
related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering
costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar 
options and other information that may be available.

At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a
reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration related to future 
product returns. Such estimates are based on historical experience and are 
immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or 
payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the financing are 
recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.

Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales 
personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other 
obligations suchasaccess to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, 
Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software updates. As our contract 
costs related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the 
costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers
related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and we 
have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over 
vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense 
in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer 
from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee

We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain 
international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles 
through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale 
value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing 
partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales 
price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling 
their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is 
generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, 
for a pre-determined resale value.

With the exception of two programs which are discussed within theAutomotive 
Leasingsection, we now recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to
customers in accordance with the new revenue standard as a sale with a right of 
return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to
exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine 
whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a 
vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the 
guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to 
exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive 
sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without 
resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return 
reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees
are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected 
future market values. The two programs that are still being recorded as 
operating leases are discussed in further detail below inVehicle Sales to 
Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback OptionandVehicle 
Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is Probable.

Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale 
value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds 
equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or 
was exercised. For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing 
collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases, we also accrued 
interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The remaining sale proceeds were 
deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee 
period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expired at the 
earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. 
We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as 
operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated their value, less estimated 
residual value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the same period.

In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of 
the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining 
deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive 
leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to 
us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty 
in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining 
deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net 
book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle 
inventory.

Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, 
internet connectivity, Autopilot, full self-driving and over-the-air software 
updates on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of
the following (in thousands):

                                                                          Year

Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the 
performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of 
December 31, 2018. From the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018, 
revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $81.0 million. Of
the total deferred revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value 
guarantees, we expect to recognize $326.7 million of revenue in the next 12 
months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as 
discussed above inAutomotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee.

Automotive Regulatory Credits

California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle 
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in 
that state during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and 
regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles may earn 
regulatory credits (“ ZEV credits”) and may sell excess credits to other 
manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory 
requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require 
compliance related to greenhouse gas (“ GHG”) emissions and also allow for the 
sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a 
manufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, 
such as ZEV and GHG credits, on our vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn 
these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with 
third-parties to purchase our regulatory credits. Payments for regulatory 
credits are typically received at the point control transfers to the customer, 
or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.

We recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time control of 
the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive 
revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Revenue from the sale of 
regulatory credits totaled $418.6 million, $360.3 million and $302.3 million for
the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively. We had no 
deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits as of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting 
guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale
value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior 
to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all programs with resale value 
guarantees were accounted for as operating leases.

Direct Vehicle Leasing Program

We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in certain 
locations in the U. S., Canada and Europe. Currently, the direct vehicle leasing
program is only offered for new leases to qualified customers in the U. S. and 
Canada. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from 
Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the 
option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a 
pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as 
operating leases. We record leasing revenues toautomotive leasing revenueon a 
straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of
these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended 
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recognized $393.2 million, $220.6 million 
and $112.7 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had 
deferred $109.8 million and $96.6 million, respectively, of lease-related 
upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the 
contractual terms of the individual leases.

We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental 
cost of contract administration, referral fees and sales commissions from the 
origination of automotive lease agreements as an element of operating lease 
vehicles, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the 
related lease agreement. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a 
customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback 
Option

We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value 
guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the United States. These 
transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an 
end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles has not been 
transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions 
continue to be accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in 
accordance with ASC 840, Leases. Under this program, cash is received for the 
full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is generally 
recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront deposit is 
recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to 
automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option period and 
accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles 
under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance
sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive 
leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash
received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is 
classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows 
from financing activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either 
purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or
paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the 
sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale 
value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. In cases where 
the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option
period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive 
leasing revenue. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this 
program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $479.8million as of 
December 31, 2018, including $309.8million within a 12-month period. As of 
December 31, 2018, we had $558.3millionof such borrowings recorded in resale 
value guarantees and $92.5million recorded in deferred revenue liability. For 
the year ended December 31, 2018, we recognized $332.4 million of leasing 
revenue related to this program.

On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under 
our buyback options program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any of 
these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the buyback values of our
vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to their 
estimated values, although we have not experienced any material losses during 
any period to date.

Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is 
Probable

For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees
to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has
a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided
to them, we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases. The 
process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes 
a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is 
exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s 
economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this program
since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the 
exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The amount of sale proceeds 
equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or 
is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing 
revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee
period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these 
vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and
depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing 
revenue over the same period.

In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the 
guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining 
deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive 
leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us 
during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an 
amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred 
balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of 
the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory. As of 
December 31, 2018, $149.7 million of the guarantees were exercisable by 
customers within the next 12 months. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we 
recognized $157.9 million of leasing revenue related to this program.

Services and Other Revenue

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle 
services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle components to other 
manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to 
third party customers. There were no significant changes to the timing or amount
of revenue recognition as a result of our adoption of the new revenue standard.

Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as 
services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the 
performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a 
stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service
plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone 
selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these 
items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for 
used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point 
when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable 
upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within 
customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred revenue related to
services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2018 and 2017.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage Sales

Energy generation and storage revenues consists of the sale of solar energy 
systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large 
commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to 
residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, 
design, and installation of the system. Post installation, residential and small
scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures
and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale 
commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system 
upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when 
control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system
passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue 
for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation 
over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage 
systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the 
installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control
transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing
installation, when installed and accepted by the customer. Payment for such 
storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business.

For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage 
system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the 
system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with 
contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized
over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a 
percentage of total estimated contract costs. Certain large-scale commercial and
utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system sales also include 
operations and maintenance service which are negotiated with the design and 
installation contracts and are thus considered to be a combined contract with 
the design and installation service. For certain large commercial and utility 
grade solar energy systems and energy storage systems where the percentage of 
completion method does not apply, revenue is recognized when control transfers, 
which is when the product has been delivered to the customer for energy storage 
systems and when the project has received permission to operate from the utility
for solar energy systems. Operations and maintenance service revenue is 
recognized ratably over the respective contract term. Customer payments for such
services are usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.

In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single 
contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the 
contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone 
selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using 
market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential 
installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work
in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any 
fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized 
as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to 
commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy 
systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar 
energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one
year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.

As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may 
provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the 
underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention
requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a 
bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a 
solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance 
guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other 
forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility 
grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable 
customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation 
activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of 
variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most 
likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional 
performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the 
transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal 
of revenue will not occur.

We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from
customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service 
and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably 
over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, 
deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $148.7 million 
and $124.0 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue 
balance as of January 1, 2018, was $41.4 million for the year ended December 31,
2018. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount 
of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance obligations for 
energy generation and storage sales with an original expected contract length of
one year or less. As of December 31, 2018, total transaction price allocated to 
performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for 
contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $117.9 
million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $7.0 million in the next 12 
months and the remaining over a period up to 30 years.

Energy Generation and Storage Leasing

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements forenergy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue 
from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned 
from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference 
between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred
revenue on the consolidated balance sheet.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under 
power purchase agreements (“ PPAs”), we have determined that these agreements 
should be accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is 
recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under
the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and 
maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective 
customer contract term. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, deferred revenue 
related to such customer payments amounted to $225.4 million and $206.8 million,
respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and 
incentives received from utility companies and various local and state 
government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of 
December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, deferred revenue from rebates and 
incentives amounted to $36.8 million and $27.2 million, respectively.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system 
leases or PPAs, which include the incremental cost of contract administration, 
referral fees and sales commissions, as an element of solar energy systems, 
leased and to be leased, net, and subsequently amortize these costs over the 
term of the related lease or PPA.

Cost of Revenues

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales

Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor 
costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and 
machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations 
of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and
reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also
includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying 
value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to
provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

Automotive Leasing

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of 
operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses 
recognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle
connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs 
related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.

Services and Other

Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing 
non-warranty after-salesservices, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, 
and costs for retail merchandise. Cost of services and other revenue also 
includes direct parts, material and labor costs, manufacturing overhead 
associated with the sales of electric vehicle components and systems to other 
manufacturers and sales by our acquired subsidiaries to third party customers.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage

Energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect 
material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other 
overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In 
addition, where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases, the cost of 
revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar 
energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization
of any initial direct costs.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs

Marketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are 
included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the 
consolidated statement of operations. We incurred marketing, promotional and 
advertising costs of $70.0 million, $66.5 million and $48.0 million in the years
ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other 
comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensiveincome(loss) consists of 
unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and available-for-sale 
marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments that have 
been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).

Stock-Based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (“ RSUs”) and our employee stock
purchase plan (the “ ESPP”). The fair value of stock option awards with only 
service conditions and the ESPP is estimated on the grant or offering date using
the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on 
the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. 
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period (prior to 
2017, net of estimated projected forfeitures). Stock-based compensation 
associated with awards assumed from the acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“ 
SolarCity”) is measured as of the acquisition date using the relevant 
assumptions and recognized on a straight-line basis over the remaining requisite
service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of 
estimated projected forfeitures).

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on
the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based 
compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market 
conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance
and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant 
performance condition is considered probable of achievement. The fair value of 
such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations (see 
Note15, Equity Incentive Plans).

As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we
incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate 
significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially 
impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation 
expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation 
expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and 
selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of 
operations.

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and 
vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual 
provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We 
have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the 
noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that 
reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach
using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“ HLBV”) method. We, 
therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable 
noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet 
date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet
as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as 
noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the 
consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would 
hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation 
provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at
their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws 
effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The 
third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are 
determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable 
noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the 
start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital 
transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable 
noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The 
redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in 
the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these 
third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or 
other assets.

Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common 
stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the 
period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average 
shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and 
convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted 
method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) 
per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect 
is dilutive. Since we intend to settle in cash the principal outstanding under 
the 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, the 1.25% Convertible Senior 
Notes due in 2021 and the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, we use 
the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if 
any. Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our bond hedges, we 
entered into convertible note hedges (see Note 13, Long-Term Debt Obligations). 
However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating 
potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive.

The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded 
from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock 
attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive:

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents 
are primarily comprised of money market funds.

Restricted Cash

We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our 
restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to 
lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate 
leases, insurance policies, credit card borrowing facilities and certain 
operating leases. In addition, restricted cash includes cash received from 
certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held 
to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities.

The following table totals cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as 
reported on the consolidated balance sheets; the sums are presented in the 
consolidated statements of cash flows (in thousands):

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for DoubtfulAccounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain 
systems, sales of energy generation and storage products, receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers 
and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an 
allowance against accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will 
be collected. We write-off accounts receivable when they are deemed 
uncollectible.

We typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle
and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery, except
for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing 
arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions.

MyPower Customer Notes Receivable

We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower
was offered by SolarCity to provide residential customers with the option to 
finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The 
outstanding balances, net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible 
amounts, are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of 
prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as MyPower
customer notes receivable, net of current portion, for the long-term portion. In
determining the allowance and credit quality for customer notes receivable, we 
identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and also
consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that 
might impact the level of future credit losses. Customer notes receivable that 
are individually impaired are charged-off as a write-off of the allowance for 
losses. Since acquisition, there have been no new significant customers with 
known disputes or collection issues, and the amount of potentially uncollectible
amounts has been insignificant. In addition, there were no material non-accrual 
or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31, 2018.

Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, 
convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are 
primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality 
financial institutions in the U. S. These deposits are typically in excess of 
insured limits. As of December 31, 2018 and 2017, no entity represented 10% or 
more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our
interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated 
multinational banks.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source 
suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components 
of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes 
acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from 
these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is 
computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which 
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for 
solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory 
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on 
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of 
our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the
net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us 
to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost
to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A
small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported 
financial results.

Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program, vehicles
delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback 
option, as well as vehicles delivered to customers with resale value guarantee 
where exercise is probable are classified as operating lease vehicles as the 
related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases (refer to 
theAutomotive Leasing Revenuesection above for details). Operating lease 
vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is 
computed using the straight-line method over the expected operating lease term. 
The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated balance 
sheets as of December 31, 2018 and 2017 was $2.55 billion and $4.85 billion, 
respectively. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December
31, 2018 and 2017 was $457.6 million and $733.3 million, respectively.

Solar Energy Systems, Leased and To Be Leased

We are the lessor of solar energy systems under leases that qualify as operating
leases. Our leases are accounted for in accordance with ASC 840. To determine 
lease classification, we evaluate the lease terms to determine whether there is 
a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, 
whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life or whether the 
present value of the minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at 
lease inception. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and 
fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination. Solar 
energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems leased to customers      30 to 35 years               
  Initial direct costs related to customer      Lease term (up to 25 years)  

Solar energy systems held for lease to customers are installed systems pending 
interconnection with the respective utility companies and will be depreciated as
solar energy systems leased to customers when they have been interconnected and 
placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems 
that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems 
leased to customers when they are completed, interconnected and leased to 
customers. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease 
acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related 
customer lease agreements.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recognized 
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using 
the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the respective 
assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and      2 to 12 years   
  Building and building improvements      15 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software         3 to 10 years   

Depreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method 
whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life
of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated productive life
for Model S and Model X tooling was 325,000 vehicles based on our current 
estimates of production. As of December 31, 2018, the estimated productive life 
for Model 3 tooling was 1,000,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of 
production.

Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance 
sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement
of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified 
useful life.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on 
construction-in-progress is included within property, plant and equipment and is
amortized over the life of the related assets.

Furthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the 
construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit lease 
arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to 
any potential cost overruns or our other commitments under the arrangements. In 
these cases, we recognize build-to-suit lease assets under construction and 
corresponding build-to-suit lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet,
in accordance with ASC 840. Once construction is completed, if a lease meets 
certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we remove the asset and liability and account
for the lease as an operating lease. Otherwise, the lease is accounted for as a 
capital lease.

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review our property, plant and equipment, long-term prepayments and 
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be 
recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the 
future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the 
asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted-down to its fair
value. For the year ended December 31, 2018, we have recognized certain material
impairments of our long-lived assets (refer to Note 4, Intangible Assets, for 
further details). For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we have 
recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to thirty years.

Capitalization of Software Costs

For costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs 
incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary 
project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. 
Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful life of three to ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets 
on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U. S. 
dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the 
different rates we apply to accumulated deficits, including current period 
income or loss, and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly
average functional currency rate to its income or loss and the month-end 
functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income
(expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended
December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains
of $1.5 million, losses of $52.3 million and gains of $26.1 million, 
respectively.

Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production 
powertrain components and systems and energy storage products we sell. In 
addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the 
solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years. We 
accrue a warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best 
estimate of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and 
recalls when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to 
date and an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These 
estimates are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, 
and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause 
material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve 
does not include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject 
to lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, 
as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The 
portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 
months is included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining 
balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated 
balance sheet. Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, automotive sales
with resale value guarantees that were previously recorded within operating 
lease assets require a corresponding warranty accrual, which is included in the 
table below. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in 
the consolidated statements of operations. Accrued warranty activity consisted 
of the following (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017, and 2016, warranty costs incurred 
for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt 
arrangements were $21.9 million, $35.5 million and $19.0 million, respectively.

Solar Energy System Performance Guarantees

We guarantee a specified minimum solar energy production output for certain 
solar energy systems leased or sold to customers, generally for a term of up to 
30 years. We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure that these outputs are 
being achieved. We evaluate if any amounts are due to our customers and make any
payments periodically as specified in the customer agreements. As of December 
31, 2018 and 2017, we had recognized a liability of $7.5 million and $6.3 
million, respectively, within accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated 
balance sheets, related to these guarantees based on our assessment of the 
exposures.

Solar Renewable Energy Credits

We account for solar renewable energy credits (“ SRECs”) when they are purchased
by us or sold to third-parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy systems 
owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any 
specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs 
incurred to generate the SRECs. For SRECs purchased by us, we record these SRECs
at their cost, subject to impairment testing. We recognize revenue from the sale
of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, 
if any, is then recorded to cost of revenue.

Deferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue

We have solar energy systems that are eligible for ITCs that accrue to eligible 
property under the Internal Revenue Code (“ IRC”). Under Section 50(d)(5) of the
IRC and the related regulations, a lessor of qualifying property may elect to 
treat the lessee as the owner of such property for the purposes of claiming the 
ITCs associated with such property. These regulations enable the ITCs to be 
separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the ITCs.
Under our lease pass-through fund arrangements, we can make a tax election to 
pass-through the ITCs to the investors, who are the legal lessee of the 
property. Therefore, we are able to monetize these ITCs to the investors who can
utilize them in return for cash payments. We consider the monetization of ITCs 
to constitute one of the key elements of realizing the value associated with 
solar energy systems. Consequently, we consider the proceeds from the 
monetization of ITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy 
systems.

In accordance with the relevant FASB guidance, we recognize revenue from the 
monetization of ITCs when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is 
fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably
assured. An ITC is subject to recapture under the IRC if the underlying solar 
energy system either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in
ownership within five years of its placed-in-service date; the recapture amount 
decreases on each anniversary of the placed-in-service date. Since we have an 
obligation to ensure that the solar energy system is in-service and operational 
for a term of five years in order to avoid any recapture of the ITC, we 
recognize revenue as the recapture amount decreases, assuming the other revenue 
recognition criteria above have been met. As a result, the monetized ITC is 
initially recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets, and 
subsequently, one-fifth of the monetized ITC is recognized as energy generation 
and storage revenue on the consolidated statement of operations on each 
anniversary of the solar energy system’s placed-in-service date over five years.
As discussed in theRevenue Recognitionsection above, following the adoption of 
the new revenue standard on January 1, 2018, we no longer defer the monetized 
ITC as deferred revenue outstanding and have reclassified all ITC deferred 
revenue as of December 31, 2017 to our opening accumulated deficit.

We indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our non-compliance. 
We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture event is remote, and 
consequently, we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the
consolidated balance sheets.

Nevada Tax Incentives

We have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in 
Nevada that provide abatements for sales, use, real property, personal property 
and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and 
transferable tax credits. These incentives are available for the applicable 
periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on either June 30, 2024 or June
30, 2034 (depending on the incentive). Under these agreements, we were eligible 
for a maximum of $195.0 million of transferable tax credits, subject to capital 
investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of at least $3.50 billion, 
which we exceeded during 2017, and specified hiring targets for Gigafactory 1, 
which we exceeded during 2018. We record these credits as earned when we have 
evidence there is a market for their sale. Credits are applied as a cost offset 
to either employee expense or to capital assets, depending on the source of the 
credits. Credits earned from employee hires or capital spending by our partners 
at Gigafactory 1 are recorded as a reduction to operating expenses. As of 
December 31, 2018 and 2017, we had earned $195.0 million and $163.0 million of 
transferable tax credits under these agreements, respectively.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) issued ASU No. 
2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, to replace the existing revenue 
recognition criteria for contracts with customers. In August 2015, the FASB 
issued ASU No. 2015-14, Deferral of the Effective Date, to defer the effective 
date of ASU No. 2014-09 to interim and annual periods beginning after December 
15, 2017. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent 
Considerations, ASU No. 2016-10, Identifying Performance Obligations and 
Licensing, ASU No. 2016-11, Rescission of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting 
Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the 
March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting, ASU No. 2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and 
Practical Expedients, and ASU No. 2016-20, Technical Corrections and 
Improvements, to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We adopted 
the ASUs on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a 
cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit. The adoption of the ASUs changed 
the timing of revenue recognition to be at delivery for certain vehicle sales to
customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, which now qualify 
to be accounted for as sales with a right of return as opposed to the prior 
accounting as operating leases or collateralized lease borrowings. Upon adoption
of the ASUs, we recorded a decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit of 
$623.2 million including income tax effects, which were immaterial. Refer to 
theRevenue Recognitionsection above for details.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to require lessees to
recognize all leases, with limited exceptions, on the balance sheet, while 
recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease 
accounting. The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies
certain aspects of lessor accounting. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 
2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted 
Improvements, and ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, to 
clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No. 2016-02. The ASUs are effective for 
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early 
adoption permitted. We will adopt the ASUs on January 1, 2019 on a modified 
retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated
deficit balance. Prior comparative periods will not be restated under this 
method, and we will adopt all available practical expedients, as applicable. 
Further, solar leases that commence on or after January 1, 2019, where we are 
the lessor and which are currently accounted for as leases, will no longer meet 
the definition of a lease. Instead, solar leases commencing on or after January 
1, 2019 will be accounted for under ASC 606. In addition to recognizing 
operating leases that were previously not recognized on the consolidated balance
sheet, we also expect most of our build-to-suit leases to be de-recognized with 
a net decrease of approximately of $100.0 million to our beginning accumulated 
deficit before income tax effects, as our build-to-suit leases will no longer 
qualify for build-to-suit accounting and will instead be recognized as operating
leases or finance leases. Upon adoption, our consolidated balance sheet will 
include an overall reduction in assets in the range of approximately $400.0 
million to $500.0 million and a reduction in liabilities in the range of 
approximately $500.0 million to $600.0 million. The ASUs are not expected to 
have a2016-02. material impact on the consolidated statement of operations or 
the consolidated statement of cash flows.

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on 
Financial Instruments, to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to 
be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical 
experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU 
No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables
arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting 
standards. The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after
December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is 
modified retrospective. We are currently obtaining an understanding of the ASUs 
and plan to adopt them on January 1, 2020.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash 
Receipts and Cash Payments, to reduce the diversity in practice with respect to 
the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement 
of cash flows. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning 
after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective. We adopted the 
ASU on January 1, 2018, which did not have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: 
Restricted Cash, which requires entities to present the aggregate changes in 
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the 
statement of cash flows. As a result, the statement of cash flows now presents 
restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as a part of the beginning and 
ending balances of cash and cash equivalents. The ASU is effective for interim 
and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is 
retrospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which resulted in 
restricted cash being combined with unrestricted cash reconciling beginning and 
ending balances. Refer to theRestricted Cashsection for the reconciliation.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a
Business, to clarify which transactions should be accounted for as acquisitions 
(or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU is effective for interim and 
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is 
prospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which did not have a 
material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for 
Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing 
Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by 
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and 
recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount 
exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to 
the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative 
assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The 
ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 
2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We have
not yet selected an adoption date, though the ASU is currently not expected to 
have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In February 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-05, Gains and Losses from the 
Recognition of Nonfinancial Assets, to clarify the scope of asset derecognition 
guidance and accounting for partial sales of nonfinancial assets. The ASU is 
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. We 
adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018 on a modified retrospective basis through a 
cumulative adjustment to accumulated deficit. Upon adoption of the ASU, we 
recorded a $9.4 million decrease to our beginning accumulated deficit balance.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, 
to provide guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based
payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU is 
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2018, which
did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to 
Accounting for Hedging Activities, to simplify the application of current hedge 
accounting guidance. The ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both 
non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and 
presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
financial statements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods 
beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of 
the ASU will be prospective for us. We plan to adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019,
and the ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on the 
consolidated financial statements.

In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical 
Expedient Transition to Topic 842, to permit an entity to elect a practical 
expedient to not re-evaluate land easements that existed or expired before the 
entity’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and that are not currently 
accounted for as leases. The ASU is effective for the same periods as ASU No. 
2016-02, and the ASU will not have a material impact on the consolidated 
financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for 
Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Service
Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs 
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the 
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain
internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use 
software license). The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is 
either retrospective or prospective. We are currently obtaining an understanding
of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020.
