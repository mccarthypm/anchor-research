| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 15 - Equity Incentive Plans

In 2010, we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”). The 2010 
Plan provides for the granting of stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights 
to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 
2010 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. 
Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonqualified stock
options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, 
our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and are exercisable over a 
maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates 
when the employment or consulting relationship ends. In addition, as a result of
our acquisition of SolarCity, we assumed its equity award plans and its 
outstanding equity awards as of the Acquisition Date. SolarCity’s outstanding 
equity awards were converted into equity awards to acquire our common stock in 
share amounts and prices based on the Exchange Ratio, with the equity awards 
retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect 
immediately prior to the acquisition. The vesting and other terms and conditions
of the assumed equity awards are substantially the same as those of the 2010 
Plan.

As of December 31, 2018, 9,089,194 shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2010 Plan.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity:

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the 
grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the 
weighted-average assumptions in the following table:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is 
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common 
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield for 
zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s 
expected life. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, given our then limited 
history with employee grants, we used the “simplified” method in estimating the 
expected term of our employee grants; the simplified method utilizes the average
of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the employee grant. Beginning
with the fourth quarter of 2017, we use our historical data in estimating the 
expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the 
average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common 
stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.

2018 CEO Performance Award

In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 
20,264,042 stock option awards to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). 
The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting 
schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones 
(performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment 
either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and 
service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 
CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors 
that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins
at $100 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50 billion
thereafter, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones 
focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA 
have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized
basis. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, 
depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation.

                   $ 175.0                           $14.0  

As of December 31, 2018, the following operational milestones were considered 
probable of achievement:

  Total revenue of $20.0 billion;  

  Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 billion; and  

  Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion.  

Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2018 CEO Performance Award 
is recognized over the longer of the expected achievement period for each pair 
of market capitalization or operational milestones, beginning at the point in 
time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being 
met. If additional operational milestones become probable, stock-based 
compensation expense will be recorded in the period it becomes probable 
including cumulative catch-up expense for the service provided since the grant 
date. The market capitalization milestone period and the valuation of each 
tranche are determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and is used as the basis 
for determining the expected achievement period. The probability of meeting an 
operational milestone is based on a subjective assessment of our future 
financial projections. Even though no tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award
vest unless a market capitalization and a matching operational milestone are 
both achieved, stock-based compensation expense is recognized only when an 
operational milestone is considered probable of achievement regardless of how 
much additional market capitalization must be achieved in order for a tranche to
vest. At our current market capitalization, even the first tranche of the 2018 
CEO Performance Award will not vest unless our market capitalization were to 
approximately double from the current level and stay at that increased level for
a sustained period of time. Additionally, stock-based compensation represents a 
non-cash expense and is recorded as a selling, general, and administrative 
operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations.

As of December 31, 2018, we had $598.0 million of total unrecognized stock-based
compensation expense for the operational milestones that were considered 
probable of achievement, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 3.1 years. As of December 31, 2018, we had unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense of $1.51 billion for the operational milestones that were 
considered not probable of achievement. From March 21, 2018, when the grant was 
approved by our stockholders, through December 31, 2018, we recorded stock-based
compensation expense of $174.9 million related to the 2018 CEO Performance 
Award.

2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in 
the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of 
our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees 
(excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 1,073,000 shares of our common 
stock. Each award consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the 
vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance 
milestones, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date:

  1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production 
vehicle;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 
vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production 
vehicle; and  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater
than 30% for any three-year period.  

As of December 31, 2018, the following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period.  

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance 
milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2018, we had 
unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $10.9 million for the 
performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the 
year ended December 31, 2018, we did not record any additional stock-based 
compensation related to these awards. For the years ended December 2017 and 
2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $6.8 million and $25.3 
million, respectively, related to these awards.

2012 CEO Performance Award

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock option awards to 
our CEO (the “2012 CEO Performance Award”). The 2012 CEO Performance Award 
consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming 
continued employment and service through each vesting date. Each vesting tranche
requires a combination of a pre-determined performance milestone and an 
incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.00 billion, as compared 
to our initial market capitalization of $3.20 billion at the time of grant. As 
ofDecember 31, 2018, the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting
tranches and the following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle;  

  Aggregate production of 200,000 vehicles; and  

  Aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles.  

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2018, we had unrecognized 
stock-based compensation expense of $5.7 million for the performance milestone 
that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended December 
31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $0.1 
million, $5.1 million and $15.8 million, respectively, related to the 2012 CEO 
Grant.

OurCEOearns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage 
requirements under California law, and he is subject to income taxes based on 
such base salary. However, he has never accepted and currently does not 
accepthissalary.

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the 
periods presented due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. As of 
December 31, 2018, we had $1.57 billion of total unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2018, 2017 and 2016, we issued 399,936, 
370,173 and 321,788 shares under the ESPP for $108.8 million, $71.0 million and 
$51.7 million, respectively. There were 2,023,954 shares available for issuance 
under the ESPP as of December 31, 2018.
