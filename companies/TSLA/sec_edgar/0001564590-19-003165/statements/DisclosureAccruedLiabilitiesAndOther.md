Taxes payable included value added tax, sales tax, property tax, use tax and 
income tax payables.

Accrued purchases primarily reflected receipts of goods and services that we had
not been invoiced yet. As we are invoiced for these goods and services, this 
balance will reduce and accounts payable will increase.

Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, automotive sales with resale 
value guarantees that are now accounted for as sales with a right of return 
require a corresponding sales return reserve, which is included in accrued 
liabilities and other when the reserve is current and other long-term 
liabilities when the reserve is non-current on the consolidated balance sheets. 
For automotive sales without a resale value guarantee, we record a reserve 
against revenue for the estimated variable consideration related to future 
product returns in accrued liabilities and other on the consolidated balance 
sheets. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policiesfor details.
