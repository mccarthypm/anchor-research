Grohmann Acquisition

On January 3, 2017, we completed our acquisition of Grohmann Engineering GmbH 
(now Tesla Grohmann Automation GmbH or “ Grohmann”), which specializes in the 
design, development and sale of automated manufacturing systems, for $109.5 
million in cash. We acquired Grohmann to improve the speed and efficiency of our
manufacturing processes.

At the time of acquisition, we entered into an incentive compensation 
arrangement for up to a maximum of $25.8 million of payments contingent upon 
continued service with us for 36 months after the acquisition date. Such 
payments would have been accounted for as compensation expense in the periods 
earned. However, during the three months ended March 31, 2017, we terminated the
incentive compensation arrangement and accelerated the payments thereunder. As a
result, we recorded the entire $25.8 million as compensation expense in the 
three months ended March 31, 2017, which was included within selling, general 
and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of operations.

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future 
events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The 
judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected
future cash flows and related discount rates, can materiality impact our results
of operations. Significant inputs used included the amount of cash flows, the 
expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates. During the fourth 
quarter of 2017, we finalized our estimate of the acquisition date fair values 
of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Prior to finalization, there
were no changes to the fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed.

The allocation of the purchase consideration was based on management’s estimate 
of the acquisition date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed, as follows (in thousands):

  Assets acquired:                                                         
  Cash and cash equivalents                                           334  
  Accounts receivable                                              42,947  
  Inventory                                                        10,031  
  Property, plant and equipment                                    44,030  
  Intangible assets                                                21,723  
  Prepaid expenses and other assets, current and non-current        1,998  
  Total assets acquired                                           121,063  
  Liabilities assumed:                                                     
  Accounts payable                                                (19,975  
  Accrued liabilities                                             (12,403  
  Debt and capital leases, current and non-current                 (9,220  
  Other long-term liabilities                                     (10,049  
  Total liabilities assumed                                       (51,647  
  Net assets acquired                                              69,416  
  Goodwill                                                         40,065  
  Total purchase price                                            109,481  

Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected synergies 
from potential monetization opportunities and from integrating Grohmann’s 
technology into our automotive business as well as the acquired talent. Goodwill
is not deductible for U. S. income tax purposes and is not amortized. Rather, we
assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value.

Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired

The determination of the fair values of the identified intangible assets and 
their respective useful lives as of the acquisition date was as follows (in 
thousands, except for useful lives):

                               Fair Value                      
  Developed technology         $               12,528      10  
  Software                                      3,341       3  
  Customer relations                            3,236       6  
  Trade name                                    1,775       7  
  Other                                           843       2  
  Total intangible assets      $               21,723          

Grohmann’s results of operations since the acquisition date have been included 
within the automotive segment in the consolidated statements of operations. 
Standalone and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because 
they were not material to the consolidated financial statements.

SolarCity Acquisition

On November 21, 2016 (the “ Acquisition Date”), we completed our acquisition of 
SolarCity. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ Merger 
Agreement”), each issued and outstanding share of SolarCity common stock was 
converted into 0.110 (the “ Exchange Ratio”) shares of our common stock. In 
addition, SolarCity’s stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were 
assumed by us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our 
common stock based on the Exchange Ratio, with the awards retaining the same 
vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the 
acquisition.

Fair Value of Purchase Consideration

The Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was as follows (in
thousands, except for share and per share amounts):

  Total fair value of Tesla common stock                              $2,058,477
  Fair value of replacement Tesla stock                                   87,500
  Total purchase price                                                $2,145,977

Furthermore, the assumed unvested SolarCity awards of $95.9 million are 
recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining requisite 
service period. Per ASC 805, the replacement of stock options or other 
share-based payment awards in conjunction with a business combination represents
a modification of share-based payment awards that must be accounted for in 
accordance with ASC 718, Stock Compensation. As a result of our issuance of 
replacement awards, a portion of the fair-value-based measure of the replacement
awards is included in the purchase consideration. To determine the portion of 
the replacement awards that is part of the purchase consideration, we measured 
the fair value of both the replacement awards and the historical awards as of 
the Acquisition Date. The fair value of the replacement awards, whether vested 
or unvested, was included in the purchase consideration to the extent that 
pre-acquisition services were rendered.

Transaction costs of $21.7 million were expensed as incurred to selling, general
and administrative expense on the consolidated statements of operations.

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future 
events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The 
judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected
future cash flows and related discount rates, can materiality impact our results
of operations. Specifically, we utilized a discounted cash flow model to value 
the acquired solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, as well as the 
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries. Significant inputs used included the 
amount of cash flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the discount 
rates.

The allocation of the purchase consideration was based on management’s estimate 
of the Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities 
assumed, as follows (in thousands):

  Assets acquired:

Gain on Acquisition

Since the fair value of the net assets acquired was greater than the purchase 
price, we recognized a gain on acquisition of $88.7 million in the fourth 
quarter of 2016, which was recorded within other income (expense), net, on the 
consolidated statements of operations.

During the fourth quarter of 2017, we finalized our estimate of the Acquisition 
Date fair values of the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. Prior to 
finalization, during the year ended December 31, 2017, we recorded an $11.6 
million measurement period adjustment to MyPower customer notes receivable, net 
of current portion, and a $46.2 million measurement period adjustment to accrued
liabilities. The measurement period adjustments were recorded as losses to other
income (expense), net, in the consolidated statement of operations and reduced 
the gain on acquisition initially recognized in the fourth quarter of 2016.

Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired

The determination of the fair values of the identified intangible assets and 
their respective useful lives as of the Acquisition Date was as follows (in 
thousands, except for useful lives):

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information

The consolidated financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2016 
include SolarCity’s results of operations from the Acquisition Date through 
December 31, 2016. Net revenues and operating loss attributable to SolarCity 
during this period and included in the consolidated statement of operations were
$84.1 million and $68.2 million, respectively.

The following unaudited pro forma financial information for the year ended 
December 31, 2016 gives effect to our acquisition of SolarCity as if the 
acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 (in thousands, except per share 
data):

  Revenue                                            $       7,536,876

  Weighted-average shares used in computing net                154,090  

The unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments for the 
depreciation of solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, the intangible 
assets acquired, the effect of the acquisition on deferred revenue and 
noncontrolling interests and the transaction costs related to the acquisition. 
The unaudited pro forma financial information is presented for illustrative 
purposes only and is not necessarily indicative of the results of operations of 
future periods. The unaudited pro forma financial information does not give 
effect to the potential impact of current financial conditions, regulatory 
matters, synergies, operating efficiencies or cost savings that might be 
associated with the acquisition. Consequently, actual results could differ from 
the unaudited pro forma financial information presented.
