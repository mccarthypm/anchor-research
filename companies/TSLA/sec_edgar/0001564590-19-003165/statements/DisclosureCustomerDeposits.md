| **  Customer Deposits** | Note 12 - Customer Deposits

Customer deposits primarily consisted of cash payments from customers at the 
time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and 
any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of 
installation, including the fair values of any customer trade-in vehicles that 
are applicable toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposit amounts and 
timing vary depending on the vehicle model, the energy product and the country 
of delivery. In the case of a vehicle, customer deposits are fully refundable up
to the point the vehicle is placed into the production cycle. In the case of an 
energy generation or storage product, customer deposits are fully refundable 
prior to the entry into a purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited 
time thereafter (in accordance with applicable laws). Customer deposits are 
included in current liabilities until refunded or until they are applied towards
the customer’s purchase balance. As of December 31, 2018 and December 31, 2017, 
we held $792.6 million and $853.9 million, respectively, in customer deposits.

Due to the adoption of the new revenue standard, customer deposits now include 
prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, 
such as vehicle maintenance plans, which were previously reported as deferred 
revenue. As a result, the adoption of the new revenue standard increased the 
customer deposits balance as of December 31, 2018 by $58.4 million as compared 
to what the balance would have been under ASC 605, Revenue Recognition(see Note 
2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).
