| **  Non-cancellable Operating Lease Payments Receivable** | Note 9 - Non-cancellable Operating Lease Payments Receivable

As of December 31, 2018, future minimum lease payments to be received from 
customers under non-cancellable operating leases for each of the next five years
and thereafter were as follows (in thousands):

  2019              501,625  
  2020              418,299  
  2021              270,838  
  2022              186,807  
  2023              188,809  
  Thereafter      2,469,732  
  Total           4,036,110  

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners 
with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. In 
addition, we assumed through our acquisition of SolarCity and will continue to 
enter into PPAs with our customers that are accounted for as leases. These 
customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by the installed 
solar energy system at a predefined rate per kilowatt-hour of power produced. 
The future payments from such arrangements are not included in the above table 
as they are a function of the power generated by the related solar energy 
systems in the future. Furthermore, the above table does not include 
performance-based incentives receivable from various utility companies. The 
amount of contingent rentals recognized as revenue for the years presented were 
not material.
