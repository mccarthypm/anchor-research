The in-process research and development (“ IPR& D”), which we acquired from 
SolarCity, is accounted for as an indefinite-lived asset until the completion or
abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. If the research 
and development efforts are successfully completed and commercial feasibility is
reached, the IPR& D would be amortized over its then estimated useful life. If 
the research and development efforts are not completed or are abandoned, the 
IPR& D might be impaired. The fair value of the IPR& D was estimated using the 
replacement cost method under the cost approach, based on the historical 
acquisition costs and expenses of the technology adjusted for estimated 
developer’s profit, opportunity cost and obsolescence factor. During the year 
ended December 31, 2018, we concluded that a portion of the IPR& D was not 
commercially feasible, and consequently recognized an abandonment loss of $13.3 
million in restructuring and other expenses in the consolidated statements of 
operations. Additionally, $26.5 million of IPR& D was put into production during
the year ended December 31, 2018, andwe expect to complete the remaining 
research and development efforts in the first half of 2019. The nature of the 
research and development efforts consists principally of planning, designing and
testing the technology for viability in manufacturing solar cells and modules. 
If commercial feasibility is not achieved for the remaining IPR& D, we would 
likely look to other alternative technologies.

The costs associated with one of the trade names acquired by us has been fully 
amortized as of December 31, 2018 as we phased out the use of such trade name in
our sales and marketing efforts.

Total future amortization expense for intangible assets was estimated as follows
