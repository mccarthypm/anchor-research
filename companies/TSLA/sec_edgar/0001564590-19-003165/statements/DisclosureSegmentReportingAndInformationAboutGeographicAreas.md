We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy 
generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development,
manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of 
automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also 
comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle
services, sales of used vehicles, sales of electric vehicle components and 
systems to other manufacturers, retail merchandise, and sales by our acquired 
subsidiaries to third party customers. The energy generation and storage segment
includes the design, manufacture, installation, sales, and leasing of solar 
energy generation and energy storage products. Our CODM does not evaluate 
operating segments using asset or liability information. The following table 
presents revenues and gross margins by reportable segment (in thousands):
