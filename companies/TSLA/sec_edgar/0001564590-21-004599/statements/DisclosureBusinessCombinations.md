For the year ended December 31, 2020, we completed various acquisitions for 
which consideration was immaterial on an individual basis and in aggregate.

Maxwell Acquisition

On May 16, 2019 (the “Acquisition Date”), we completed our strategic acquisition
of Maxwell Technologies, Inc. (“Maxwell”), an energy storage and power delivery 
products company, for its complementary technology and workforce. Pursuant to 
the related Agreement and Plan of Merger, each issued and outstanding share of 
Maxwell common stock was converted into 0.0965 (the “Exchange Ratio”) shares of 
our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. In addition, 
Maxwell’s stock option awards and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by 
us and converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of our common stock
based on the Exchange Ratio, with the awards retaining the same vesting and 
other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition.

Fair Value of Purchase Consideration

The Acquisition Date fair value of the purchase consideration was $207 million (
as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split,4,514,840 shares issued at $45.90 
per share, the opening price of our common stock on the Acquisition Date).

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for 
business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase 
price was allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
and liabilities based on their estimated fair values as of the Acquisition Date.

Fair value estimates are based on a complex series of judgments about future 
events and uncertainties and rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The 
judgments used to determine the estimated fair value assigned to each class of 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected
future cash flows and related discount rates, can materially impact our 
consolidated financial statements. Significant inputs used for the model 
included the amount of cash flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the
discount rates.

The allocation of the purchase price was based on management’s estimate of the 
Acquisition Date fair values of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed, as 
follows (in millions):

  Assets acquired:                                                      
  Cash and cash equivalents                                         32  
  Accounts receivable                                               24  
  Inventory                                                         32  
  Property, plant and equipment, net                                27  
  Operating lease right-of-use assets                               10  
  Intangible assets                                                105  
  Prepaid expenses and other assets, current and non-current         3  
  Total assets acquired                                            233  
  Liabilities and equity assumed:                                       
  Accounts payable                                                 (10  
  Accrued liabilities and other                                    (28  
  Debt and finance leases, current and non-current                 (44  
  Deferred revenue, current                                         (1  
  Other long-term liabilities                                      (14  
  Additional paid-in capital                                        (8  
  Total liabilities and equity assumed                            (105  
  Net assets acquired                                              128  
  Goodwill                                                          79  
  Total purchase price                                             207  

Goodwill represented the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the
net assets acquired and was primarily attributable to the expected synergies 
from integrating Maxwell’s technology into our automotive segment as well as the
acquired talent. Goodwill is not deductible for U. S. income tax purposes and is
not amortized.

Identifiable Intangible Assets Acquired

The determination of the fair value of identified intangible assets and their 
respective useful lives were as follows (in millions, except for estimated 
useful life):

                               Fair Value               Useful Life          
  Developed technology         $               102                        9  
  Customer relations                             2                        9  
  Trade name                                     1                       10  
  Total intangible assets      $               105                           

Maxwell’s results of operations since the Acquisition Date have been included 
within the automotive segment. Standalone and pro forma results of operations 
have not been presented because they were not material to the consolidated 
financial statements.

Other 2019 Acquisitions

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we completed various other acquisitions
generally for the related technology and workforce. Total consideration for 
these acquisitions was $96 million, of which $80 million was paid in cash. In 
aggregate, $36 million was attributed to intangible assets, $51 million was 
attributed to goodwill within the automotive segment, and $9 million was 
attributed to net assets assumed. Goodwill is not deductible for U. S. income 
tax purposes. The identifiable intangible assets were related to purchased 
technology, with estimated useful lives of one to nine years.

Standalone and pro forma results of operations have not been presented because 
they were not material to the consolidated financial statements, either 
individually or in aggregate.
