Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State 
University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”) with respect to Gigafactory New 
York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are 
continuing to designate further buildouts at the facility. The SUNY Foundation 
covered (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing facility up to $350 
million, (ii) the acquisition and commissioning of the manufacturing equipment 
in an amount up to $275 million and (iii) $125 million for additional specified 
scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) only, subject to the maximum funding 
allocation from the State of New York; and we were responsible for any 
construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts. The SUNY Foundation 
owns the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment purchased by the
SUNY Foundation. Following completion of the manufacturing facility, we have 
commenced leasing of the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment 
owned by the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10 years, with an option 
to renew, for $2.00 per year plus utilities.

Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment 
targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New 
York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined 
capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State 
of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual 
basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such 
date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation 
requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million “program payment” 
to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. 
Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, 
then additional amounts may become payable by us.

As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory 
New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were granted a one-yeardeferral of our 
obligation to be compliant with our applicable targets under such agreement on 
April 30, 2020, which was memorialized in an amendment to our agreement with the
SUNY Foundation in July 2020. Moreover, we had exceeded our investment and 
employment obligations under this agreement prior to such mandated reduction of 
operations. We do not currently expect any issues meeting all applicable future 
obligations under this agreement. However, if our expectations as to the costs 
and timelines of our investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp
of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or 
substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation.

Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China

We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the 
local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing 
Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to 
spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures, and to generate RMB 2.23 
billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are unwilling 
or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in 
accordance with the Chinese government’s standard terms for such arrangements, 
we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive 
compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. 
We believe the capital expenditure requirement and the tax revenue target will 
be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the 
volumes we are forecasting.

Legal Proceedings

Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the 
Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our 
acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”). Following consolidation, the
lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then 
constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their 
fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both 
derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, 
among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. 
OnJanuary27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint.
Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended 
complaint. On March17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended 
complaint. On December13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. On 
March28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed 
a request for interlocutory appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court denied that 
request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this 
early stage of the case. Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018, and 
mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed 
respective motions for summary judgment on August 25, 2019, and further 
mediations were held on October 3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions
for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January 22, 2020, all of the 
director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit
against them for an amount that would be paid entirely under the applicable 
insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any 
wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla 
received payment of approximately $43 million on September 16, 2020, which has 
been recognized in our consolidated statement of operations as a reduction to 
selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously 
incurred in the securities litigation related to the acquisition of SolarCity. 
On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ 
previously-filed motion and granted in part and denied in part defendants’ 
previously-filed motion. Fact and expert discovery is complete, and the case was
set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the Court due to safety 
precautions concerning COVID-19. The current tentative dates for the trial are 
from July 12 to July 23, 2021, subject to change based on any further safety 
measures implemented by the Court.

These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U. S. District Court 
for the District of Delaware on or about April21, 2017. They include claims for 
violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by 
Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed 
pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.

We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit 
and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the 
possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.

Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles

OnOctober10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U. S. 
District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its
current officers, and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of 
federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other 
relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from 
May4, 2016 to October6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made 
materially false and misleading statements regarding Tesla’s preparedness to 
produce Model 3 vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March23, 
2018, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May25, 2018. The court granted
defendants’ motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed their 
amended complaint on September 28, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to 
dismiss the amended complaint on February 15, 2019. The hearing on the motion to
dismiss was held on March 22, 2019, and on March 25, 2019, the Court ruled in 
favor of defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On April 8, 
2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and on July 17, 2019 filed their 
opening brief. We filed our opposition on September 16, 2019. A hearing on the 
appeal before the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit (“Ninth Circuit”)
was held on April 30, 2020. On January 26, 2021, the Ninth Circuit affirmed the 
District Court’s dismissal of the stockholder claims. We continue to believe 
that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit 
vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if 
any, associated with this lawsuit.

On October 26, 2018, in a similar action, a purported stockholder class action 
was filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against 
Tesla, Elon Musk, and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities
by Tesla in August 2017. The complaint alleges misrepresentations made by Tesla 
regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of
2017 in connection with such offering and seeks unspecified compensatory damages
and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla 
securities in such offering. Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court.
On January 22, 2019, plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court, 
instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial 
purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the U. S. District 
Court for the Northern District of California who is hearing the 
above-referenced earlier filed federal case. On February 5, 2019, the Court 
stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss the complaint in 
such earlier filed federal case. After such earlier filed federal case was 
dismissed, defendants filed a motion on July 2, 2019 to dismiss this case as 
well. This case is now stayed pending a ruling from the Ninth Circuit on the 
earlier filed federal case with an agreement that if defendants prevail on 
appeal in such case, this case will be dismissed. We believe that the claims are
without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are 
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with 
this lawsuit.

Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award

On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and 
derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the 
members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate 
waste, unjust enrichment, and that such board members breached their fiduciary 
duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan. The complaint seeks, 
among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the 
stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to 
dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018 
and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the 
motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court 
granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the 
motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Our 
answer was filed on December 3, 2019, and trial is set for April 2022. Fact 
discovery is ongoing. We believe the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without
merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate 
the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation

On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of 
Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to 
Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts
claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory 
and injunctive relief, unspecified damages, and other relief. Defendants filed 
their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is set for September 2022, and fact 
discovery is ongoing. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to
defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible 
loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

Securities LitigationRelating to Potential Going Private Transaction

Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class 
actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s 
August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of
the suits are now pending in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District 
of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each 
purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to 
Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief 
on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs 
filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants 
the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The now-consolidated purported 
stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel
was briefed and argued before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled 
regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on 
November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April
15, 2020, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated
to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November
25, 2020. Trial is set for May 2022. We believe that the claims have no merit 
and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the 
potential loss, or range of loss, associated with these claims.

Between October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were 
filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the members of 
Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made 
and actions connected to a potential going private transaction. In addition to 
these cases, on October 25, 2018, another derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.
S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Mr. Musk and the members 
of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. The Courts in both the 
Delaware federal court and Delaware Court of Chancery actions have consolidated 
their respective actions and stayed each consolidated action pending resolution 
of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. We 
believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them 
vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if 
any, associated with these lawsuits.

Beginning on March 7, 2019, various stockholders filed derivative suits in the 
Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, naming Mr. Musk and 
Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, also related to Mr. Musk’s 
August 7, 2018 Twitter post that is the basis of the above-referenced 
consolidated purported stockholder class action, as well as to Mr. Musk’s 
February 19, 2019 Twitter post regarding Tesla’s vehicle production. The suit 
asserts claims for breach of fiduciary duty and seeks declaratory and injunctive
relief, unspecified damages, and other relief. Plaintiffs agreed to a 
stipulation that these derivative cases would be stayed pending the outcome of 
the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In March 
2019, plaintiffs in one of these derivative suits moved to lift the stay and for
an expedited trial. Briefs were filed on March 13, 2019, and the hearing was 
held on March 18, 2019. Defendants prevailed, with the Court denying the 
plaintiffs’ request for an expedited trial and granting defendants’ request to 
continue to stay this suit pending the outcome of the above-referenced 
consolidated purported stockholder class action. On May 4, 2020, the same 
plaintiffs again filed a motion requesting to lift the stay and for an expedited
trial. Briefs were filed on May 13, 2020 and May 15, 2020 and a hearing was held
on May 19, 2020. Defendants again prevailed, with the Court denying plaintiffs’ 
request to lift the stay and for an expedited trial. The plaintiffs also sought 
leave to file an amended complaint, which was granted. The Court entered an 
order implementing its ruling on May 21, 2020. The amended complaint asserts 
additional allegations of breach of fiduciary duty related to two additional 
Twitter posts by Mr. Musk, dated July 29, 2019 and May 1, 2020, and seeks 
unspecified damages and declaratory and injunctive relief. We believe that the 
claims have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable
to estimate the potential loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these 
lawsuits.

Certain Investigations and Other Matters

We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental 
authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”)
and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate 
with such regulatory and governmental requests.

In particular, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Elon
Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private and (b) 
certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and 
other public statements relating to Model 3 production. The take-private 
investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered into with the 
SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an amendment. On
December 4, 2019, the SEC (i) closed the investigation into the projections and 
other public statements regarding Model 3 production rates and (ii) issued a 
subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and contracts 
including Tesla’s regular financing arrangements. Separately, the DOJ had also 
asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above matters 
related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates.

Aside from the settlement, as amended, with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s 
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any 
developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge 
no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any 
wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been cooperating and 
will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the 
outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue
an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact
on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial 
position.

We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise 
from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or 
development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse 
impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial 
position, and brand.

Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns

We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any 
losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from 
reductions in investment tax credits claimed under U. S. federal laws for the 
installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are 
charged from a co-sited solar power facility (“ITC”s). Generally, such 
obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying
solar energy systems as assessed by the U. S. Internal Revenue Service (the 
“IRS”) for purposes of claiming ITCs. For each balance sheet date, we assess and
recognize, when applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure 
from this obligation based on all the information available at that time, 
including any audits undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the 
fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this 
obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the filing 
date.

The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this 
obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar 
energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the 
values that the IRS would determine as the fair value for the systems for 
purposes of claiming ITCs. We claim ITCs based on guidelines provided by the U. 
S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the IRS. We use fair 
values determined with the assistance of independent third-party appraisals 
commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs that are passed-through
to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot determine exactly how the 
IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs, we are unable to reliably
estimate the maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under 
this obligation as of each balance sheet date.

We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are 
associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can 
be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or 
the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one 
state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the 
tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives 
received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the 
contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to 
indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in 
the amount of state or local incentives actually received.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2020, we had $233 million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
