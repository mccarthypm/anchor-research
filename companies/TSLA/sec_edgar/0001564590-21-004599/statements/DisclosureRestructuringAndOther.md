During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring 
actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. As a result, we 
recognized $50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination 
expenses and losses from closing certain stores impacting both segments. We 
recognized $47 million in impairment related to the IPR& D intangible asset as 
we abandoned further development efforts and $15 million for the related 
equipment within the energy generation and storage segment. We also incurred a 
loss of $37 million for closing operations in certain facilities. On the 
statement of cash flows, the amounts were presented in the captions in which 
such amounts would have been recorded absent the impairment charges. The 
employee termination expenses were substantially paid by December 31, 2019, 
while the remaining amounts were non-cash.

During the year ended December 31, 2018, we carried-out certain restructuring 
actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency and recognized $37 
million of employee termination expenses and estimated losses from sub-leasing a
certain facility. The employee termination cash expenses of $27 million were 
substantially paid by the end of 2018, while the remaining amounts were 
non-cash. Also included within restructuring and other activities was $55 
million of expenses (materially all of which were non-cash) from restructuring 
the energy generation and storage segment, which comprised of disposals of 
certain tangible assets, the shortening of the useful life of a trade name 
intangible asset and a contract termination penalty. In addition, we concluded 
that a small portion of the IPR& D asset is not commercially feasible. 
Consequently, we recognized an impairment loss of $13 million. We recognized 
settlement and legal expenses of $30 million in the year ended December 31, 2018
for the settlement with the SEC relating to a take-private proposal for Tesla. 
These expenses were substantially paid by the end of 2018.
