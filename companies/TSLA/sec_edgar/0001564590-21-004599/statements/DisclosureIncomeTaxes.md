A provision for income taxes of $292 million, $110 million and $58 million has

As of December 31, 2020, we recorded a valuation allowance of $2.93 billion for 
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $974 million, 
increased by $150 million, and decreased by $38 million during the years ended 
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The changes in valuation 
allowance are primarily due to additional U. S. deferred tax assets and 
liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have net $260 million of 
deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are 
more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future 
earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have material release of valuation 
allowance for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018. We continue to 
monitor the realizability of the U. S. deferred tax assets taking into account 
multiple factors, including the results of operations and magnitude of excess 
tax deductions for stock-based compensation. We intend to continue maintaining a
full valuation allowance on our U. S. deferred tax assets until there is 
sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of these 
allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending on the 
amount of stock-based compensation tax deduction available in the future, we may
release the valuation allowance associated with the U. S. deferred tax assets in
the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance 
would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to
income tax expense for the period the release is recorded.

As of December 31, 2020, we had $9.65 billion of federal and $6.60 billion of 
state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable 
income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 
2031 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity 
and some of the companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of 
control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can 
be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control 
limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.

As of December 31, 2020, we had research and development tax credits of $417 
million and $373 million for federal and state income tax purposes, 
respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits 
will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state of 
California research and development tax credits can be carried forward 
indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $167 
million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly 
expire until 2033.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have 
determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of 
our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership 
changes.

The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate 
of 15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25% statutory corporate 
income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this 
beneficial income tax rate of 15% for 2019 through 2023.

No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded 
relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred 
tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in 
millions):

  Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions      (39  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax               59

  Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions       66  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax               41  
  December 31, 2020                                              380  

As of December 31, 2020, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial. 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $353 million, if recognized, would not affect our 
effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset 
that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance.

We file income tax returns in the U. S., California and various state and 
foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 
years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2014 and 2019
remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes, and tax years 
2004 to 2019 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes. 
All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to 
adjustment for U. S. federal and California income tax purposes. Tax years 2008 
to 2019 remain subject to examination in other U. S. state and foreign 
jurisdictions.

The potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to 
unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. However, we cannot 
reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time.

The U. S. Tax Court issued a decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner related to 
the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing arrangement.
On June 7, 2019, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals (Ninth Circuit) reversed the
Tax Court decision and upheld the validity of Treas. Reg. Section 
1.482-7A(d)(2), requiring stock-based compensation costs be included in the 
costs shared under a cost sharing agreement. On June 22, 2020, the U. S. Supreme
Court denied to review the Ninth Circuit decision. Prior to the U. S. Supreme 
Court’s denial, Tesla has already included stock-based compensation in cost 
sharing allocation agreement and hence retains its position.
