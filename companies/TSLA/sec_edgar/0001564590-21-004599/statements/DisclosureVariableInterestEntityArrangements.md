| **  Variable Interest Entity Arrangements** | Note 17 - Variable Interest Entity Arrangements

We have entered into various arrangements with investors to facilitate the 
funding and monetization of our solar energy systems and vehicles. In 
particular, our wholly owned subsidiaries and fund investors have formed and 
contributed cash and assets into various financing funds and entered into 
related agreements. We have determined that the funds are variable interest 
entities (“VIEs”) and we are the primary beneficiary of these VIEs by reference 
to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, Consolidation. We have 
considered the provisions within the agreements, which grant us the power to 
manage and make decisions that affect the operation of these VIEs, including 
determining the solar energy systems or vehicles and the associated customer 
contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs, redeploying solar energy 
systems or vehicles and managing customer receivables. We consider that the 
rights granted to the fund investors under the agreements are more protective in
nature rather than participating.

As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in the financial 
statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these
VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs 
are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of 
income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated 
expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are 
allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in the 
agreements.

Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest
in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula 
specified in the agreements.

Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order 
and priority specified in the agreements.

Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have 
been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and 
maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In 
some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the fund investors as specified 
in the agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general credit or 
to that of other funds. None of the assets of the funds had been pledged as 
collateral for their obligations.

The aggregate carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after 
elimination of any intercompany transactions and balances, in the consolidated 
balance sheets were as follows (in millions):
