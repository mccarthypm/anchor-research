Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla”, the “Company”, “we”, “us” or “our”) was incorporated in 
the State of Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell 
high-performance fully electric vehicles and design, manufacture, install and 
sell solar energy generation and energy storage products. Our Chief Executive 
Officer, as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”), organizes our company, 
manages resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and 
reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage.

As of and following December 31, 2020, there has continued to be widespread 
impact from the coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic. In 2020, we 
temporarily suspended operations at each of our manufacturing facilities 
worldwide for a part of the first half of the year. Some of our suppliers and 
partners also experienced temporary suspensions before resuming, including 
Panasonic, which manufactures battery cells for our products at our Gigafactory 
Nevada. We also instituted temporary employee furloughs and compensation 
reductions while our U. S. operations were scaled back. Finally, reduced 
operations or closures at motor vehicle departments, vehicle auction houses and 
municipal and utility company inspectors resulted in challenges in or 
postponements for our new vehicle deliveries, used vehicle sales, and energy 
product deployments. By the second half of 2020, however, we resumed operations 
at all of our manufacturing facilities and have continued to increase our output
and add additional capacity and work with each of our suppliers and government 
agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our production. On the other hand, 
certain government regulations and shifting social behaviors have continued to 
limit or close non-essential transportation, government functions, business 
activities and person-to-person interactions. In some cases, the relaxation of 
such trends has recently been followed by actual or contemplated returns to 
stringent restrictions on gatherings or commerce. We cannot predict the duration
or direction of such trends, which have also adversely affected and may in the 
future affect our operations.

On February 19, 2020, we completed a public offering of our common stock and 
issued a total of 15.2 million shares ( as adjusted to give effect to theStock 
Split, as described in the paragraph below), for total cash proceeds of $2.31 
billion, net of underwriting discounts and offering costs of $28 million.

On August 10, 2020, our Board of Directors declared a five-for-one split of the 
Company’s common stock effected in the form of a stock dividend (the “Stock 
Split”). Each stockholder of record on August 21, 2020 received a dividend of 
four additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, distributed 
after close of trading on August 28, 2020. All share and per share amounts 
presented herein have been retroactively adjusted to reflect the impact of the 
Stock Split.

On September 1, 2020, we entered into an Equity Distribution Agreement with 
certain sales agents to sell $5.00 billion in shares of our common stock from 
time to time through an “at-the-market” offering program. Such sales were 
completed by September 4, 2020 and settled by September 9, 2020, with the sale 
of 11,141,562 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $5.00 
billion and net proceeds of $4.97 billion, net of sales agents’ commissions of 
$25 million and other offering costs of $1 million.

On December 8, 2020, we entered into a separate Equity Distribution Agreement 
with certain sales agents to sell $5.00 billion in shares of our common stock 
from time to time through an “at-the-market” offering program. Such sales were 
completed by December 9, 2020 and settled by December 11, 2020, with the sale of
7,915,589 shares of common stock resulting in gross proceeds of $5.00 billion 
and net proceeds of $4.99 billion, net of sales agents’ commissions of $13 
million and other offering costs of $1 million.
