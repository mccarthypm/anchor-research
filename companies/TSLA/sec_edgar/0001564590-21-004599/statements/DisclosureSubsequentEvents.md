Early Conversions of Convertible Senior Notes

Between January 1, 2021 and February 5, 2021, we have received additional 
conversion notices on our 2022 Notes and 2024 Notes for $62 million and $623 
million in aggregate principal amounts, respectively, for which we intend to 
settle the principal amounts in cash during the three months ended March 31, 
2021.

Investments

In January 2021, we updated our investment policy to provide us with more 
flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not 
required to maintain adequate operating liquidity. As part of the policy, we may
invest a portion of such cash in certain specified alternative reserve assets. 
Thereafter, we invested an aggregate$1.50billion in bitcoin under this policy. 
Moreover, we expect to begin accepting bitcoin as a form of payment for our 
products in the near future, subject to applicable laws and initially on a 
limited basis, which we may or may not liquidate upon receipt.

We will account for digital assets as indefinite-lived intangible assets in 
accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. The digital assets 
are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on the 
consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred since 
acquisition. We will perform an analysis each quarter to identify impairment. If
the carrying value of the digital asset exceeds the fair value based on the 
lowest price quoted in the active exchanges during the period, we will recognize
an impairment loss equal to the difference in the consolidated statement of 
operations.

The cost basis of the digital assets will not be adjusted upward for any 
subsequent increases in their quoted prices on the active exchanges. Gains (if 
any) will not be recorded until realized upon sale.
