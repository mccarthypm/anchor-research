Construction in progress is primarily comprised of construction of Gigafactory 
Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and equipment 
and tooling related to the manufacturing of our products. We are currently 
constructing Gigafactory Berlin under conditional permits. Completed assets are 
transferred to their respective asset classes, and depreciation begins when an 
asset is ready for its intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized
during periods of significant capital asset construction and amortized over the 
useful lives of the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2020 and
2019, we capitalized $48 million and $31 million, respectively, of interest.

Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was
$1.57 billion, $1.37 billion and $1.11 billion, respectively. Gross property, 
plant and equipment under finance leases as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was 
$2.28 billion and $2.08 billion, respectively, with accumulated depreciation of 
$816 million and $483 million, respectively.

Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the 
production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery 
cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output
from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the 
arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, Leases, we account for their 
production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for 
each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single 
lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes 
embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their 
production equipment within property, plant and equipment, net, on the 
consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and 
finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed using
the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the 
total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 
2020 and 2019, we had cumulatively capitalized costs of $1.77 billion and $1.73 
billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the 
production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.

In 2019, the Shanghai government agreed to provide $85 million of certain 
incentives in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment 
investments at Gigafactory Shanghai, of which $46 million was received in cash 
and the remaining $39 million was in the form of assets and services contributed
by the government. In 2020, the Shanghai government agreed to provide an 
additional $122 million of such incentives. Of the total incentives provided 
between both years, $123 million was received in cash in 2020. Proceeds from the
grant must be spent on qualified capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai as 
stipulated in the agreement. These incentives were taken as a reduction to 
property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets and cash 
receipts are reflected as investing cash inflows on the consolidated statements 
of cash flows.
