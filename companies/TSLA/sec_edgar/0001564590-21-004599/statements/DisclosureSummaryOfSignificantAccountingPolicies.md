Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and 
reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we 
have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any
variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We 
form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in 
order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes 
associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing
programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership 
is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a 
controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through
arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires 
a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to 
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s 
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the 
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a 
VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered 
the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
of all the VIEs (see Note 17, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We 
evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that 
we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and 
balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U. S. generally 
accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the accompanying notes.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the 
global economy and financial markets. The estimates used for, but not limited 
to, determining significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee 
arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability of accounts receivable, 
inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair value of 
financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease vehicles
and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have assessed 
the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances that 
required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected the 
carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of this 
Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur and 
additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially from 
these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current 
period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the 
accompanying notes. Restricted cash and MyPower customer notes receivable have 
been reclassified to other assets and resale value guarantees has been 
reclassified to other liabilities.

Revenue Recognition

Adoption of ASC 606 revenue standard

On January 1, 2018, we adopted ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts with Customers, 
using the modified retrospective method.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales Revenue

Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles
and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the 
definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our 
Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Full Self-Driving (“FSD”) features 
and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon
delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. 
Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance 
with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such 
as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air 
software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and 
recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready 
obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue 
related to these other features and services over the performance period, which 
is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle or the eight-year life 
of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD features is recognized when functionality
is delivered to the customer. For our obligations related to automotive sales, 
we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used to develop and 
deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and other 
information that may be available.

At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a
sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration 
related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on 
historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, 
any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange 
the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.

Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales 
personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other 
obligations suchas access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, 
FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to
automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a 
contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to 
shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have 
elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over 
vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense 
in cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected 
from a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option

We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain 
international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles 
through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale 
value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing 
partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales 
price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling 
their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is 
generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, 
for a pre-determined resale value.

With the exception of the Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value 
Guarantee and a Buyback Optionprogram discussed within the Automotive Leasing 
section below, we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to 
customersin accordance with ASC 606as a sale with a right of return as we do not
believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale
value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine
whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a 
vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the 
guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to 
exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive 
sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without 
resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return 
reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees
are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected 
future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market 
values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there 
have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate 
more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions 
change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Due to price 
adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2020, we estimated that 
there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options
that were provided prior to such adjustments. As a result, along with the 
estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for 
vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales return 
reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting 
in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of$72 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2020. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect 
to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a 
corresponding reduction in cost of automotive sales of $42 million for the year 
ended December 31, 2020. The net impact was$30 million reduction in gross profit
for the year ended December 31, 2020. The total sales return reserve on vehicles
previously sold under our buyback options program was $703 million and $639 
million as of December 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, respectively, of which 
$202 million and$93 million was short term, respectively.

Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, 
internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates on 
automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the 
following (in millions):

Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the 
performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of 
December 31, 2020. From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2019, 
revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2020 was $283 million. 
From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018, revenue recognized 
during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $220 million. Of the total deferred 
revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees as of 
December 31, 2020, we expect to recognize $1.13 billion of revenue in the next 
12 months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period 
as discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee.

Automotive Regulatory Credits

We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under 
various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles, greenhouse gas, fuel 
economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who 
can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory 
requirements.

Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point 
control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory 
credits at the time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the 
purchasing party as automotive sales revenue in the consolidated statements of 
operations. Revenue from the sale of automotive regulatory credits totaled $1.58
billion, $594 million and $419 million for the years ended December 31, 2020, 
2019 and 2018, respectively. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive 
regulatory credits was $21 million and $140 million as ofDecember 31, 2020and 
2019, respectively. We expect to recognize the majority of the deferred revenue 
as of December 31, 2020 in the next 12 months.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program

We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs 
in the U. S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers 
are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the
end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or 
for Model S and Model X leases in certain regions, may opt to purchase the 
vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing 
transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues toautomotive 
leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we 
record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue.
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $752 
million, $532 million and $393 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, 
respectively. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had deferred $293 million and
$218 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual
leases.

Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction 
price of automotive contracts.

Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback 
Option

We offered buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value
guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the U. S. and where we expected
the customer had a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value 
guarantee provided to them at contract inception, we continued to recognize 
these transactions as operating leases. These transactions entailed a transfer 
of leases, which we had originated with an end-customer, to our leasing partner.
As control of the vehicles had not been transferred in accordance with ASC 606, 
these transactions were accounted for as interest-bearing collateralized 
borrowings in accordance with ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under 
this program, cash was received for the full price of the vehicle and the 
collateralized borrowing value was generally recorded within resale value 
guarantees and the customer upfront down payment was recorded within deferred 
revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue amount to automotive leasing revenue 
on a straight-line basis over the option period and accrue interest expense 
based on our borrowing rate. The option period expires at the earlier of the end
of the contractual option period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We 
capitalized vehicles under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the
consolidated balance sheets, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a 
lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized 
during the period, is classified as collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings
within cash flows from financing activities in the consolidated statements of 
cash flows. Following the adoption of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new 
agreements under this program are accounted for as operating leases and there 
was no material change in the timing and amount of revenue recognized over the 
term. Consequently, any cash flows for new agreements are classified as 
operating cash activities on the consolidated statements of cash flows.

At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either 
purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or
paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the 
sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale 
value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customer 
can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing 
partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we 
expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing 
revenue. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, 
should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was $42 million and $214 million as
of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively, including $23 millionwithin a 
12-month period from December 31, 2020. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had
$42million and $238 million, respectively, of such borrowings recorded in 
accrued liabilities and other and other long-term liabilities and $11 millionand
$29 million, respectively, recorded in deferred revenue liability. For the years
ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $77 million, $186 million 
and $332 million, respectively, of leasing revenue related to this program. The 
net carrying amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was $43 
million and $190 million, respectively, as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program

We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan 
arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842 in certain 
countries in Asia and Europe, which we introduced in volume during the third 
quarter of 2020. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not 
have a right to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term.
If the customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to
the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. 
Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is 
reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the 
customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making 
all contractual payments. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle 
directly under these programs for up to 48 months. Our loan arrangements under 
these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We recognize all revenue and 
costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and 
automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle 
to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is 
recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a 
monthly basis. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we recognized $120 million 
of sales-type leasing revenue and $87 million of sales-type leasing cost of 
revenue.

Services and Other Revenue

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle 
services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired 
subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue.

Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as 
services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the 
performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a 
stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service
plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone 
selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these 
items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for 
used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point 
when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable 
upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within 
customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related 
to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2020 and 2019.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage Sales

Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy
systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large 
commercial and utility grade customers. Energy generation and storage sales 
revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and power
purchase agreements (“PPAs”) that commence after January 1, 2019, which is 
recognized as earned, based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy 
systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Under the 
practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize revenue based
on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount. Sales 
of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers 
consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the system. Post 
installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a 
proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy 
generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full 
purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and 
installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we 
install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or
the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue for the monitoring service is 
recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation over the warranty period of the 
solar energy system. Sales of energy storage systems to residential and small 
scale commercial customers consist of the installation of the energy storage 
system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, which is when the 
product has been delivered or, if we are performing installation, when installed
and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems is made upon invoice or in 
accordance with payment terms customary to the business.

For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage 
system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the 
system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with 
contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized
over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a 
percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and
as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. 
Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy 
storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are 
negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to
be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain 
large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage 
systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is 
recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered 
to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project
has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. 
Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the 
respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the 
service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are
usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.

In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single 
contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the 
contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone 
selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using 
market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential 
installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work
in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. A ny fees that 
are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an 
offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions 
paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and 
energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and
energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs 
to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.

As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may 
provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the 
underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy 
performance requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may
receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. 
Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the 
performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated 
damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial 
and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts 
include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market 
participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments 
represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract 
inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting 
period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are 
included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a 
significant reversal of revenue will not occur.

We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from
customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service 
and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably 
over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, 
deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $187 million and 
$156 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance
as of December 31, 2019 was $34 million for the year ended December 31, 2020. 
Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018 was
$41 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. We have elected the practical 
expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to
remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with 
an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we 
have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value 
of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2020, total transaction price 
allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially 
unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year
was $100 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $6 million in the next 
12 months and the remaining over a period up to 27 years.

Energy Generation and Storage Leasing

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue 
from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned 
from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference 
between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred
revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs
prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be 
accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized 
based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the 
contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and 
maintenance service fees, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the 
respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred 
revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $206 million and $226 
million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and
incentives received from utility companies and various local and state 
government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives 
amounted to $29 million and $36 million, respectively.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar 
energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, 
as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these 
costs over the term of the related agreements.

Cost of Revenues

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales

Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor 
costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and 
machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations 
of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and
reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also
includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying 
value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to
provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

Automotive Leasing

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the amortization of operating lease 
vehicles over the lease term, cost of goods sold associated with direct 
sales-type leases, as well as warranty expenses related to leased vehicles. Cost
of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle connectivity costs and 
allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger 
network for vehicles under our leasing programs.

Services and Other

Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing 
non-warranty after-sales services, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, 
costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of 
services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs,
manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to
third party customers.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect 
material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other 
overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of 
energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the 
carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable 
value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted 
demand. In agreements for solar energy system and PPAs where we are the lessor, 
the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased
solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and 
amortization of any initial direct costs.

Leases

We adopted ASC 842, Leases, as of January 1, 2019 using the cumulative effect 
adjustment approach (“adoption of the new lease standard”). In addition, we 
elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the transition 
guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward the 
historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and not 
reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. Accordingly, 
previously reported financial statements, including footnote disclosures, have 
not been recast to reflect the application of the new standard to all 
comparative periods presented. The finance lease classification under ASC 842 
includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs

Marketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are 
included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the 
consolidated statement of operations. Marketing, promotional and advertising 
costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") subjects a U. S. shareholder to tax on global
intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. 
Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due 
on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into 
our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which 
we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our 
consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other 
comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income(loss) consists of 
foreign currency translation adjustments that have been excluded from the 
determination of net income (loss).

Stock-Based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and our employee stock 
purchase plan (the “ESPP”). The fair value of stock option awards with only 
service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of RSUs is measured
on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. 
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the period.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on
the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based 
compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer 
of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such 
tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market 
capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in
time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being 
achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the 
grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date 
to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is 
achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the
related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be
recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, 
which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair 
value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo 
simulations (see Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans).

As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we
incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate 
significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially 
impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation 
expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation 
expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and 
selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of 
operations.

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and 
vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual 
provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We 
have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling 
interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the 
substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the 
hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine
the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the 
HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as 
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests
in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling 
interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance 
sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at 
each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming 
the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined
in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date 
and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the 
results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the 
noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the 
consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, 
after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the 
third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at 
least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest 
balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the 
consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem 
their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there 
may be significant fluctuations in the ending balance of redeemable 
noncontrolling interest in subsidiaries and net income (loss) attributable to 
noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries
due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are 
reached.

Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common 
stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the 
period. During the year ended December 31, 2020, we decreased net income 
attributable to common stockholders by $31 million to arrive at the numerator 
used to calculate net income per share. During the yearended December 31, 2019, 
we increased net loss attributable to common stockholders by $8 million to 
arrive at the numerator used to calculate net loss per share. These adjustments 
represent the difference between the cash we paid to the financing fund 
investors for their noncontrolling interest in our subsidiaries and the carrying
amount of the noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheets, in 
accordance with ASC 260, Earnings per Share. Potentially dilutive shares, which 
are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding 
stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury 
stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when 
calculating diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to 
common stockholders when their effect is dilutive. Since we intend to settle or 
have settled in cash the principal outstanding under our 0.25% Convertible 
Senior Notes due in 2019 (“2019 Notes”), 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 
2021 (“2021 Notes”), 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 (“2022 Notes”),
2024 Notes and our subsidiary’s 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, we 
use the treasury stock method applied using our average share price during the 
period when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if any. Furthermore, in
connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, we entered into 
convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 12, Debt). However, our 
convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive 
shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. Warrants which have a strike 
price above our average share price during the period were out of the money and 
were not included in the tables below. Warrants will be included in the 
weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income (loss) per share of 
common stock in the period(s) they are settled.

The following table presents the reconciliation of basic to diluted weighted 
average shares used in computing net income (loss) per share of common stock 
attributable to common stockholders, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock 
Split (in millions):

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents 
are primarily comprised of money market funds.

Restricted Cash

We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our 
restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to 
lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate 
leases, insurance policies, credit card borrowing facilities and certain 
operating leases. In addition, restricted cash includes cash received from 
certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held 
to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities. We record 
restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine
current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the 
restriction.

Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the 
consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of 
regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, government rebates already
passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by 
leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the 
amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against 
the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.

Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our
accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer
payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from
our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on 
the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable 
balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically 
transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is 
dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can 
take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing 
timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may 
have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to 
period.

MyPower Customer Notes Receivable

We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower
was offered by one of our subsidiaries to provide residential customers with the
option to finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. 
The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for credit losses, are presented 
on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of prepaid expenses and other 
current assets for the current portion and as other non-current assets for the 
long-term portion. We adoptedASC 326, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses, on 
January 1, 2020 on a modified retrospective basis. Under ASC 326, expected 
credit loss for customer notes receivable are measured on a collective basis and
are determined as the difference between the amortized cost basis and the 
present value of cash flows expected to be collected. In determining expected 
credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit losses, current 
economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that affect the 
collectability of the future cash flows. We write-off customer notes receivable 
when they are deemed uncollectible and the amount of potentially uncollectible 
amounts has been insignificant. Using a modified retrospective approach for the 
impact upon adoption, we recorded an increase to the allowance for credit losses
of $37 million on January 1, 2020, with an offset to accumulated deficit. As of 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer 
notes receivable, net of allowance for credit losses, was $334 million and $402 
million, respectively, of which $9 million was due in the next 12 months as of 
December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively. As of December 31, 2020, the allowance
for credit losses was $45 million. In addition, there were no material 
non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31, 2020.

Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, 
convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are 
primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality 
financial institutions in the U. S. These deposits are typically in excess of 
insured limits. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, no entity represented 10% or 
more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our
convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with
several highly-rated multinational banks.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source 
suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components 
of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes 
acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from 
these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Although all of our manufacturing facilities are operational, and we continue to
increase our output and add additional capacity and are working with each of our
suppliers and government agencies on meeting, ramping and sustaining our 
production, our ability to sustain this trajectory depends, among other things, 
on the readiness and solvency of our suppliers and vendors through any 
macroeconomic factors resulting from the COVID-19 pandemic.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is 
computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which 
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for 
solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory 
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about 
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of 
our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the
net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us 
to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost
to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A
small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported 
financial results.

Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program and 
vehicles delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a 
buyback option where there is significant economic incentive to exercise at 
contract inception are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related 
revenue transactions are treated as operating leases under ASC 842 ( refer to 
the Automotive Leasing Revenue section above for details). Operating lease 
vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally 
depreciate their value, less salvage value, using the straight-line-method to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The gross cost 
of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was $3.54 billion 
and $2.85 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles on the consolidated 
balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation of $446 million and
$406 million as of December 31, 2020 and 2019, respectively.

Solar Energy Systems, Net

We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Prior to January 1, 2019, these 
leases were accounted for as operating leases in accordance with ASC 840. Under 
ASC 840, to determine lease classification, we evaluated the lease terms to 
determine whether there was a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option 
at the end of the lease, whether the lease term was greater than 75% of the 
useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 
90% of the fair value at lease inception. Agreements for solar energy system 
leases and PPAs that commence after January 1, 2019 no longer meet the 
definition of a lease upon the adoption of ASC 842 and are instead accounted for
in accordance with ASC 606. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful 
lives and fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease 
termination. Solar energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated 
depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems in service               30 to 35 years               
  Initial direct costs related to customer      Lease term (up to 25 years)  

Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy
systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. 
Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under 
installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when 
they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs 
related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are 
capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.

Property, Plant and Equipment, net

Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are 
recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally 
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
respective assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and      2 to 12 years   
  Building and building improvements      15 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software         3 to 10 years   

Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance 
sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement
of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified 
useful life.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on 
construction-in-progress is included within property, plant and equipment, net 
and is amortized over the life of the related assets.

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term 
prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may
not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount 
to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If
the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its 
fair value. For the year ended December 31, 2020, we have recognized no material
impairments of our long-lived assets. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 
2018, we have recognized certain impairments of our long-lived assets (refer to 
Note 22, Restructuring and Other, for further details).

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to thirty years.

Goodwill

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. 
For the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, we had not recognized any
impairment of goodwill.

Capitalization of Software Costs

For costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs 
incurred during the application development stage to property, plant and 
equipment, net on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary 
project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. 
Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful life of three years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an 
annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U. S. 
dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the 
different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet.
For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to 
its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to 
translate the balance sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other 
(expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the 
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we recorded net foreign currency 
transaction losses of $114 million, gains of $48 million and gains of $2 
million, respectively.

Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty
on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems 
we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty 
reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the 
projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls when 
identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an 
estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates 
are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and 
changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material 
changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not 
include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to 
operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or
PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The
portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 
months is included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining 
balance is included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated 
balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues 
in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our 
automotive business, accrued warranty balance was primarily related to our 
automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in 
millions):

Solar Renewable Energy Credits

We account for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (“SRECs”) when they are 
purchased by us or sold to third parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy 
systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any 
specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs 
incurred to generate the SRECs. We recognize revenue within the energy 
generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is 
transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to 
energy generation and storage cost of revenue.

Nevada Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into 
agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide 
abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and 
transferable tax credits of up to $195.0 million in consideration of capital 
investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. These 
incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034, depending on the 
incentive. As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had earned the maximum of $195 
million of transferable tax credits under these agreements.

Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 
20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive
grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and 
a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in 
Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be 
capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain 
minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at 
Gigafactory Texas. As of December 31, 2020, we had not yet received any grant 
funding related to property taxes paid to Travis County.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting 
for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting 
standards. The amendments in the ASU include removing exceptions to incremental 
intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial 
statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on 
interim period losses, and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition 
related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, the ASU requires that 
entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an 
entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as 
inside or outside of a business combination. The amendments in the ASU are 
effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2020, including interim 
periods therein. Early adoption of the standard is permitted, including adoption
in interim or annual periods for which financial statements have not yet been 
issued. We have not early adopted this ASU as of December 31, 2020. The ASU is 
currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of 
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848). The ASU provides 
optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by
reference rate (e. g., LIBOR) reform if certain criteria are met, for a limited 
period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing 
the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU is 
effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We will evaluate 
transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate 
reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis.
The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements.

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible 
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the 
accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in 
ASC 470- 20, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible 
instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion 
features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 
815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums 
accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer 
required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt 
instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized 
cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible 
debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when 
applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments 
to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible instruments, the most 
significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for 
diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method.
The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an 
entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from 
derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of 
contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early 
adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of 
the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.

We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2021 on a modified retrospective basis. The 
adoption is expected to reduce additional paid in capital and convertible senior
notes (mezzanine equity) by approximately $475 million and $50 million, 
respectively for the recombination of the equity conversion component of our 
convertible debt remaining outstanding, which was initially separated and 
recorded in equity, remove the remaining debt discounts recorded for this 
previous separation for approximately $269 million and reduce property, plant 
and equipment for previously capitalized interest by approximately $45 million, 
as a result. The net effect of these adjustments will be recorded as a reduction
in the balance of our opening accumulated deficit as of January 1, 2021.

We currently expect the adoption of the ASU will result in the reduction of 
non-cash interest expense for the year ending December 31, 2021 and until the 
affected notes have been settled, before the impact of reduction of our interest
capitalization, which is not expected to be material. The reduction of 
depreciation expense through cost of goods sold is not expected to be material 
for the year ending December 31, 2021. These reduced expenses will increase the 
income attributable to common stockholders for both basic and diluted earnings 
per share. The required use of the if converted method is not expected to have a
significant impact on the calculation of common share equivalents included in 
the measure of our diluted earnings per share for our 2021 Notes, 2022 Notes, 
2024 Notes and our subsidiary’s 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022. The 
amendments to the derivative accounting guidance are not expected to have a 
material impact on our consolidated financial statements. The adoption will have
no impact on the consolidated statement of cash flows.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on 
Financial Instruments, to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to 
be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical 
experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU 
No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables
arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting 
standards. Further, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU 
2019-10, ASU 2019-11, ASU 2020-02 and ASU 2020-03 to provide additional guidance
on the credit losses standard. Adoption of the ASUs is on a modified 
retrospective basis. We adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2020. The ASUs did not 
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements. ASU No. 2016-13
applies to all financial assets including loans, trade receivables and any other
financial assets not excluded from the scope that have the contractual right to 
receive cash. The adoption of this ASU did not have any impact except on MyPower
customer notes receivable. Refer to MyPower Customer Notes Receivable above for 
further details.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for 
Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing 
Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by 
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and 
recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount 
exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to 
the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative 
assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. We 
adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020. The ASU did not have a 
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for 
Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Service
Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs 
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the 
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain
internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use 
software license). We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020. The ASU 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
