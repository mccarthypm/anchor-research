| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 14 - Equity Incentive Plans

In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 
2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock
appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, 
directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be 
either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock 
options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be 
granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock 
options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over
a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically 
terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends.

As of December 31, 2020, 49.0 million shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2019 Plan, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity:

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 
31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $300.51, $56.55 and $63.29, respectively, as 
adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The aggregate release date fair 
value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 was $3.25 
billion, $502 million and $546 million, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 
31, 2020, 2019, and 2018 was $1.55 billion, $237 million and $293 million, 
respectively.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we issued 1.8 million, 
2.5 million and 2.0 million shares under the ESPP, as adjusted to give effect to
the Stock Split. There were 34.3 million shares available for issuance under the
ESPP as of December 31, 2020.

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the 
grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The 
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options 
are as follows:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is 
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common 
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield for 
zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s 
expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our
employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied 
volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical 
volatility of our common stock.

2018 CEO Performance Award

In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 101.3 
million stock option awards to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”), as 
adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The 2018 CEO Performance Award 
consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and market 
conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both Executive
Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting date. Each 
of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest upon 
certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market capitalization 
milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100.0 billion for the first tranche
and increases by increments of $50.0 billion thereafter (based on both a six 
calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average, counting
only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any one of the following eight 
operational milestones focused on total revenue or any one of the eight 
operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been achieved for the 
previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis. Adjusted 
EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders 
before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and 
amortization and stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including 
the payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share as adjusted to give effect
to the Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years 
post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously 
sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.

The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2020 was
as follows:

  Total Annualized Revenue                                  Annualized Adjusted

Stock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a 
non-cash expense and is recorded as a selling, general, and administrative 
operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations. In each quarter 
since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we have recognized expense, 
generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the 
maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponds to the number of operational milestones
that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in 
the future, in accordance with the following principles.

On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each 
tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time 
when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be 
achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.” 
Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial 
performance, each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will 
achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or 
deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to 
achieve that operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone 
achievement time.” When we first determine that an operational milestone has 
become probable of being achieved, we allocate the entire expense for the 
related tranche over the number of quarters between the grant date and the 
then-applicable “expected vesting time.” The “expected vesting time” at any 
given time is the later of (i) the expected operational milestone achievement 
time (if the related operational milestone has not yet been achieved) and (ii) 
the expected market capitalization milestone achievement time (if the related 
market capitalization milestone has not yet been achieved). We immediately 
recognize a catch-up expense for all accumulated expense for the quarters from 
the grant date through the quarter in which the operational milestone was first 
deemed probable of being achieved. Each quarter thereafter, we recognize the 
prorated portion of the then-remaining expense for the tranche based on the 
number of quarters between such quarter and the then-applicable expected vesting
time, except that upon vesting of a tranche, all remaining expense for that 
tranche is immediately recognized.

As a result, we have experienced, and may experience in the future, significant 
catch-up expenses in quarters when one or more operational milestones are first 
determined to be probable of being achieved. Additionally, the expected market 
capitalization achievement times are generally later than the related expected 
operational milestone achievement times. Therefore, if market capitalization 
milestones are achieved earlier than originally forecasted, for example due to 
periods of rapid stock price appreciation, this has resulted, and may result in 
the future, in higher catch-up expenses and the remaining expenses being 
recognized over shorter periods of time at a higher per-quarter rate.

During the three months ended June 30, 2020, the first tranche of the 2018 CEO 
Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that the 
market capitalization milestone of $100.0 billion and the operational milestone 
of $20.0 billion annualized revenue had been achieved. Therefore, the remaining 
unamortized expense of $22 million for that tranche, which was previously 
expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as determined on the grant 
date, was accelerated into the second quarter of 2020. Additionally, the 
operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 billion became 
probable of being achieved during the second quarter of 2020 and consequently, 
we recognized a catch-up expense of $79 million in that quarter.

During the three months ended September 30, 2020, the second and third tranches 
of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of 
Directors that the market capitalization milestones of $150.0 billion and $200.0
billion and the operational milestones of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $1.5 
billion and annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion had been achieved. 
Therefore, the remaining unamortized expense of $95 million and $118 million 
associated with the second and third tranches, respectively, which were 
previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters as determined on
the grant date were accelerated into the third quarter of 2020. Additionally, 
the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $6.0 billion became 
probable of being achieved during the third quarter of 2020 and consequently, we
recognized a catch-up expense of $77 million in that quarter.

During the three months ended December 31, 2020, the fourth tranche of the 2018 
CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that 
the market capitalization milestone of $250.0 billion and the operational 
milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $4.5 billion had been achieved. 
Therefore, the remaining unamortized expense of $122 million for that tranche, 
which was previously expected to be recognized ratably in future quarters 
through the third quarter of 2023 as determined on the grant date, was 
accelerated into the fourth quarter of 2020. Additionally, during the fourth 
quarter of 2020, the operational milestone of annualized Adjusted EBITDA of $8.0
billion became probable of being achieved and consequently, we recognized a 
catch-up expense of $75 million in that quarter.

As of December 31, 2020, we had $264 million of total unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense for the operational milestones that were considered either 
probable of achievement or achieved but not yet certified, which will be 
recognized over a weighted-average period of 0.6 years. As of December 31, 2020,
we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $712 million for the 
operational milestones that were considered not probable of achievement. For the
years ended December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018 we recorded stock-based 
compensation expense of $838 million, $296 million and $175 million related to 
the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in 
the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of 
our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees 
(excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 5.4 million shares of our common
stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Each award consisted of 
the following four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on 
the attainment of the future performance milestones, assuming continued 
employment and service through each vesting date:

  1/4 th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production 
vehicle;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 
vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production 
vehicle; and  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater
than 30% for any three-year period.  

As of December 31, 2020, the following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period.  

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance 
milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2020, we had 
unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $4 million for the performance 
milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended 
December 31, 2020, 2019 and 2018, we did not record any additional stock-based 
compensation related to the 2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards.

2012 CEO Performance Award

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 26.4 million stock option awards 
to our CEO (the “2012 CEO Performance Award”), as adjusted to give effect to the
Stock Split. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 vesting tranches with
a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance 
conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service 
through each vesting date. Each vesting tranche requires a combination of a 
pre-determined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our market 
capitalization of $4.00 billion, as compared to our initial market 
capitalization of $3.20 billion at the time of grant. As of December 31, 2020, 
the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the 
following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle;  

  Aggregate production of 200,000 vehicles; and  

  Aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles.  

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2020, we had unrecognized 
stock-based compensation expense of $6 million for the performance milestone 
that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended December 
31, 2020 and 2019, we did not record any additional stock-based compensation 
expense related to the 2012 CEO Performance Award. For the year ended December 
31, 2018, the stock-based compensation we recorded related to this award was 
immaterial.

Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements in
each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative losses and 
valuation allowances. During the years ended December 31, 2020, 2019, and 2018, 
stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance sheets 
was $89 million, $52 million and $18 million, respectively. As of December 31, 
2020, we had $3.51 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation 
expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a 
weighted-average period of 2.7 years.
