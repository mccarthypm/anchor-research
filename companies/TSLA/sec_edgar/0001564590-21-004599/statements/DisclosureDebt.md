Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our 
subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net 
carrying values are due to convertible senior note conversion features, debt 
discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2020, we were in 
material compliance with all financial debt covenants, which include minimum 
liquidity and expense-coverage balances and ratios.

2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In March 2014, we issued $1.20 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2021
Notes in a public offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $180 million 
in aggregate principal amount of the notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of 
the overallotment options by the underwriters. The total net proceeds from the 
issuances, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.36 billion.

As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of these
notes is now convertible into 13.8940 shares of our common stock, which is 
equivalent to a conversion price of $71.97 per share, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes have been able to 
elect to convert on or after December 1, 2020. The settlement of such an 
election to convert the outstanding notes would be in cash for the principal 
amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common stock for any 
conversion premium at our election. As of December 1, 2020, holders of these 
notes have the option to convert. Such holders also had the option to convert 
prior to December 1, 2020 under the circumstances further described below. Upon 
the early conversion of the 2021 Notes, we will pay cash for the principal 
amount and deliver shares of our common stock based on a daily conversion value.
If a fundamental change occurs prior to the applicable maturity date, holders of
these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for 
cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any 
accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur 
prior to the applicable maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for
a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection with such an event in 
certain circumstances.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion features associated with these notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $369 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of 5.96%.

In connection with the offering of these notes in March and April 2014, we 
entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to 
purchase 19.2 million shares of our common stock at a price of $71.97 per share,
as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The total cost of the convertible
note hedge transactions was $398 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby 
the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 19.2 million shares of 
our common stock at a price of $112.13 per share, as adjusted to give effect to 
the Stock Split. We received $257 million in total cash proceeds from the sales 
of these warrants. Taken together, the purchases of the convertible note hedges 
and the sales of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or 
cash payments from the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the
overall conversion from $71.97 to $112.13 per share, as adjusted to give effect 
to the Stock Split. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 
convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and 
are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction 
to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

During each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock 
exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2021 Notes on at least 
20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2021 
Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth 
quarters of 2020. As the settlement of conversion of the 2021 Notes is in cash 
for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares of our common 
stock for any conversion premium at our election, we reclassified $3 million, 
representing the difference between the aggregate principal of our 2021 Notes 
and the carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from 
permanent equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. The 
debt discounts recorded on the 2021 Notes are recognized as interest expense 
through March 2021 and early conversions have resulted in the acceleration of 
such recognition through December 31, 2020, including the losses on 
extinguishment of debt appearing in the Interest Expense table below.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $958 million in aggregate principal 
amount of the 2021 Notes were converted for $958 million in cash and 11.1 
million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock 
Split. As a result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $6 
million. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 
2021 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 
notes, resulting in the receipt of 11.1 million shares of our common stock, as 
adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle 
under their terms after the maturity or settlement of the related convertible 
debt. The remaining notes outstanding are expected to convert in the first 
quarter of fiscal year 2021. As of December 31, 2020, the if-converted value of 
the 2021 Notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $3.71 billion.

2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 
Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting 
transaction costs, were $966 million.

As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 
2022 Notes is convertible into 15.2670 shares of our common stock, which is 
equivalent to a conversion price of $65.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at 
their option, on or after December 15, 2021. Further, holders of the 2022 Notes 
may convert, at their option, prior to December 15, 2021 only under the 
following circumstances: (1) during any quarter beginning after June 30, 2017, 
if the closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether 
or not consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately 
preceding the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; 
(2) during the five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading 
day period in which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less than 98% of the 
product of the closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion 
rate for each day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3) if we 
make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified 
corporate transactions occur. Upon a conversion, the 2022 Notes will be settled 
in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. 
If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 
Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash
at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and
unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the 
maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to 
convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain 
circumstances.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of 6.00%.

In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 14.9 million 
shares of our common stock at a price of $65.50 per share as adjusted to give 
effect to the Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions 
was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the 
warrants have the option to purchase 14.9 million shares of our common stock at 
a price of $131.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from the 
sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note 
hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution 
from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall 
conversion price from $65.50 to $131.00 per share, as adjusted to give effect to
the Stock Split. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the 
convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and 
are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with 
the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction 
to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

During each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock 
exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2022 Notes on at least 
20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2022 
Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth 
quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. As we now expect to settle a 
portion of the 2022 Notes in the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified $115 
million of the carrying value of the 2022 Notes from debt and finance leases, 
net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our 
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we 
reclassified $5 million, representing the difference between the current portion
of aggregate principal of our 2022 Notes and the current portion of the carrying
value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent equity on our 
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As the settlement of 
conversion of the remainder of the 2022 Notes would be in cash, shares of our 
common stock or a combination thereof is at our election, the remaining 
liability is classified as non-current. The debt discounts recorded on the 2022 
Notes are recognized as interest expense through March 2022 and early 
conversions have resulted in the acceleration of such recognition through 
December 31, 2020, including the losses on extinguishment of debt appearing in 
the Interest Expense table below.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $474 million in aggregate principal 
amount of the 2022 Notes were converted for $474 million in cash and 6.2 million
shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a 
result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $5 million. The 
note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes 
were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2022 Notes, 
resulting in the receipt of 6.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted 
to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle under their 
terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2022 Notes. As of December 31, 
2020, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal 
amount by $4.92 billion.

2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of 
our2024Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after 
deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.

As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of the 
2024 Notes is convertible into 16.1380 shares of our common stock, which is 
equivalent to a conversion price of $61.97 per share, subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at 
their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes 
may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the 
following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing after 
September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last reported
sale price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not 
consecutive) during a period of 30 consecutive trading days ending on the last 
trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or equal 
to 130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the 
five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which 
the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading
day of such period is less than 98% of the product of the last reported sale 
price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or 
(3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be
settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our 
election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of 
the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes
for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any 
accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur 
prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder 
who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain
circumstances.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2024 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $491 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of 8.68%.

In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase 29.7 million 
shares of our common stock at a price of $61.97 per share as adjusted to give 
effect to the Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge transactions 
was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the 
warrants have the option to purchase 29.7 million shares of our common stock at 
a price of $121.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. We 
received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken 
together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of the 
warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution from the conversion of the 
2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $61.97 
to $121.50 per share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, 
the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity 
and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection 
with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a 
reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

During each of the quarters of 2020, the closing price of our common stock 
exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of the 2024 Notes on at least 
20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter, causing the 2024 
Notes to be convertible by their holders during the second, third and fourth 
quarters of 2020 and the first quarter of 2021. As we now expect to settle a 
portion of the 2024 Notes in the first quarter of 2021, we reclassified$171 
million, of the carrying value of the 2024 Notes from debt and finance leases, 
net of current portion to current portion of debt and finance leases on our 
consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. Additionally, we 
reclassified $43 million, representing the difference between the current 
portion of aggregate principal of our 2024 Notes and the current portion of the 
carrying value as of December 31, 2020, as mezzanine equity from permanent 
equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2020. As the 
settlement of conversion of the remainder of the 2024 Notes would be in cash, 
shares of our common stock or a combination thereof is at our election, the 
remaining liability is classified as non-current. The debt discounts recorded on
the 2024 Notes are recognized as interest expense through May 2024 and early 
conversions have resulted in the acceleration of such recognition through 
December 31, 2020, including the losses on extinguishment of debt appearing in 
the Interest Expense table below.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $558 million in aggregate principal 
amount of the 2024 Notes were converted for $558 million in cash and 8.0 million
shares of our common stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a 
result, we recorded a decrease to additional paid-in capital of $31 million. The
note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes 
were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, 
resulting in the receipt of 8.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted 
to give effect to the Stock Split. The related warrants will settle under their 
terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2024 Notes. As of December 31, 
2020, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal 
amount by $13.32 billion.

2025 Notes

In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 
2025 Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 
net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.77 
billion.

Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement 
(as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of 
banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% 
plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the
lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 
0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts 
receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is 
based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.

In March 2020, we upsized the Credit Agreement by $100 million, which matures 
July 2023, to $2.525 billion. In June 2020, $197 million of commitment under the
Credit Agreement expired in accordance with its terms and the total commitment 
decreased to $2.328 billion.

Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020

In December 2015, SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”) issued $113 million in 
aggregate principal amount of Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due on 
December 1, 2020 in a private placement. $13 million of these notes were issued 
to related parties.

As adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of these
notes was convertible into 16.6665 shares of our common stock, which is 
equivalent to a conversion price of $60.00 per share (subject to adjustment upon
the occurrence of specified events related to dividends, tender offers or 
exchange offers). The maximum conversion rate is capped at 21.1538 shares for 
each $1,000 of principal of these notes, which is equivalent to a minimum 
conversion price of $47.27 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a
cash conversion option. The holders of these notes were able to require us to 
repurchase their notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes. 
On or after June 30, 2017, these notes are redeemable by us in the event that 
the closing price of our common stock exceeds 200% of the conversion price for 
45 consecutive trading days ending within three trading days of such redemption 
notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any 
accrued and unpaid interest.

During the year ended December 31, 2020, $103million in aggregate principal 
amount of these notes were converted for1.7million shares of our common stock, 
as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. As a result, we recorded an 
increase to additional paid-in capital of $101 million.

Solar Bonds and other Loans

Solar Bonds are senior unsecured obligations that are structurally subordinate 
to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Solar Bonds were 
issued under multiple series with various terms and interest rates. 
Additionally, we have assumed the 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 
issued by Maxwell (the “Maxwell Notes”), which are convertible into shares of 
our common stock as a result of our acquisition of Maxwell. As of December 31, 
2020, the if-converted value of the Maxwell Notes exceeds the outstanding 
principal amount by $447 million.

Automotive Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to 
certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue 
Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. 
The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated 
by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest 
payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, 
and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize 
revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with 
our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not 
available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the 
Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. A 
third party contracted with us to provide administrative and collection services
for these automotive assets.

In August 2020, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased 
vehicles into an SPE and issued $709 million in aggregate principal amount of 
Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our other Automotive 
Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of discounts and fees, 
were $706 million.

Solar Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, our subsidiaries pool and transfer either qualifying solar 
energy systems and the associated customer contracts or our interests in certain
financing funds into SPEs and issue Solar Asset-backed Notes backed by these 
solar assets or interests to investors. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are 
consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these 
solar assets or distributed by the underlying financing funds to certain SPEs 
are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar 
Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is 
distributed to us. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer 
contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets 
and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of 
the SPEs, including the Solar Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our
other assets. We contracted with the SPEs to provide operations & maintenance 
and administrative services for the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 
2020, solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset-backed Notes had a 
carrying value of $660 million and are included within solar energy systems, 
net, on the consolidated balance sheet.

China Loan Agreements

In September 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a 
lender in China for an unsecured 12-month revolving facility of up to RMB 5.0 
billion (or the equivalent drawn in U. S. dollars), to finance vehicles 
in-transit to China (the “In-transit Finance Facility”). Borrowed funds incurred
interest at an annual rate no greater than 90% of the one-year rate published by
the People’s Bank of China. The loan facility is non-recourse to our assets. In 
September 2020, the In-transit Finance Facility matured.

In December 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into loan agreements with a 
syndicate of lenders in China for: (i) a secured term loan facility of up to RMB
9.0 billion or the equivalent amount drawn in U. S. dollars (the “Fixed Asset 
Facility”) and (ii) an unsecured revolving loan facility of up to RMB 2.25 
billion or the equivalent amount drawn in U. S. dollars (the “Working Capital 
Facility”), in each case to be used in connection with our construction of and 
production at our Gigafactory Shanghai. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the 
Fixed Asset Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to: (i) for RMB-denominated
loans, the market quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China 
minus 0.7625%, and (ii) for U. S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year 
LIBOR plus 1.3%. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Working Capital Facility
incurred interest at a rate equal to the market quoted interest rate published 
by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.4525%. The Fixed Asset Facility is secured
by certain real property relating to Gigafactory Shanghai and both facilities 
are non-recourse to our other assets. In December 2020, the Working Capital 
Facility matured.

In May 2020, one of our subsidiaries entered into an additional Working Capital 
Loan Contract (the “2020 China Working Capital Facility”) with a lender in China
for an unsecured revolving facility of up to RMB 4.00 billion (or the equivalent
amount drawn in U. S. dollars), to be used for expenditures related to 
production at our Gigafactory Shanghai. Borrowed funds bear interest at an 
annual rate of: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the market quoted interest rate 
published by an authority designated by the People’s Bank of China minus 
0.35%,(ii) for U. S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year LIBOR plus 
0.8%. The 2020 China Working Capital Facility is non-recourse to our assets and 
is scheduled to mature in June 2021, the first anniversary of the first 
borrowing under the loan.

Cash Equity Debt

In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our 
subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that 
bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our 
interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

Solar Loan-backed Notes

In January 2016 and January 2017, our subsidiaries pooled and transferred 
certain MyPower customer notes receivable into two SPEs and issued $330 million 
in aggregate principal amount of Solar Loan-backed Notes, backed by these notes 
receivable to investors. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the
transfer of these notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are 
consolidated in the financial statements. The payments received by the SPEs from
these notes receivable are used to service the semi-annual principal and 
interest payments on the Solar Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses,
and any remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are
not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including 
the Solar Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.

Warehouse Agreements

In August 2016, our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement (as 
amended from time to time, the “2016 Warehouse Agreement”) for borrowings 
secured by the future cash flows arising from certain leases and the associated 
leased vehicles. On August 17, 2017, the 2016 Warehouse Agreement was amended to
modify the interest rates and extend the availability period and the maturity 
date, and our subsidiaries entered into another loan and security agreement (the
“2017 Warehouse Agreement”) with substantially the same terms as and that shared
the same committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement. On August 16, 2018,
the 2016 Warehouse Agreement and 2017 Warehouse Agreement were amended to extend
the availability periods thereunder from August 17, 2018 to August 16, 2019 and 
extend the maturity dates fromSeptember 2019toSeptember 2020. On December 28, 
2018, our subsidiaries terminated the 2017 Warehouse Agreement after having 
fully repaid all obligations thereunder, and entered into a third loan and 
security agreement with substantially the same terms as and that shared the same
committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement (the “2018 Warehouse 
Agreement”). We refer to these agreements together as the “Warehouse 
Agreements”. Amounts drawn under the Warehouse Agreements generally bear or bore
interest at a fixed margin above (i) LIBOR or (ii) the commercial paper rate. 
The Warehouse Agreements are or were non-recourse to our other assets.

In August 2020, one of our subsidiaries terminated the 2018 Warehouse Agreement 
after having fully repaid all obligations thereunder, leaving the 2016 Warehouse
Agreement as the only remaining Warehouse Agreement. In August 2020, we further 
amended and restated the 2016 Warehouse Agreement to extend the maturity date to
September 2022. The 2016 Warehouse Agreement currently has an aggregate lender 
commitment of $1.10 billion, the same amount as the aggregate lender commitment 
previously shared with the 2018 Warehouse Agreement prior to the termination of 
the latter.

Pursuant to the Warehouse Agreements, an undivided beneficial interest in the 
future cash flows arising from certain leases and the related leased vehicles 
has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in the 
consolidated financial statements. The interest in the future cash flows arising
from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims of
our creditors other than pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the 
Warehouse Agreements. Any excess cash flows not required to pay obligations 
under the Warehouse Agreements are or were available for distributions.

Solar Term Loans

Our subsidiaries have entered into agreements for term loans with various 
financial institutions. The term loans are secured by substantially all of the 
assets of the subsidiaries, including its interests in certain financing funds, 
and are non-recourse to our other assets.

Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities

In December 2016, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the 
“Canada Credit Facility”) with a bank for borrowings secured by our interests in
certain vehicle leases. In December 2017 and December 2018, the Canada Credit 
Facility was amended to add our interests in additional vehicle leases as 
collateral, allowing us to draw additional funds. Amounts drawn under the Canada
Credit Facility bear interest at fixed rates. The Canada Credit Facility is 
non-recourse to our other assets.

In September 2020, an SPE entered into a revolving credit facility with a bank 
for borrowings secured by the beneficial interests related to certain leased 
vehicles that we transferred to the SPE. Amounts drawn under this facility bear 
interest at1.85% plus LIBOR and are non-recourse to our other assets.

Solar Revolving Credit Facility and other Loans

We have entered into various solar revolving credit facility and other loan 
agreements with various financial institutions. The solar revolving credit 
facility is secured by certain assets of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to 
our other assets.

As of December 31, 2020 and 2019, we had pledged or restricted$6.04billion and 
$5.72 billion of our assets (consisting principally of restricted cash, 
receivables, inventory, SRECs, solar energy systems, operating lease vehicles, 
land use rights, property and equipment, and equity interests in certain SPEs) 
as collateral for our outstanding debt.
