  Out of the $350.0 million authorized to be issued, $17.9 million remained 
available to be issued. See below and Note 21, Related Party Transactions, for 
Solar Bonds issued to related parties.  

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only specified assets or 
our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the 
net carrying values are due to debt discounts and deferred financing costs. As 
of December 31, 2016, we were in compliance with all financial debt covenants. 
Our debt is described further below.

0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019 and 2021 and Bond Hedge and
Warrant Transactions

In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible 
senior notes due in 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 
1.25% convertible senior notes due in 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In
April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of
2019 Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant
to the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our 
March 2014 public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after 
deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes 
and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million 
of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, and
are amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the 
contractual terms of these notes. In April 2015, the FASB issued new 
authoritative accounting guidance on simplifying the presentation of debt 
issuance costs, which we retrospectively adopted as of March 31, 2016 and 
reclassified debt issuance costs in connection with the notes to related debt 
liability. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are 
payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, 
commencing on September 1, 2014.

Each $1,000 of principal of these notes is initially convertible into 2.7788 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events. Holders of these notes may convert their notes at their option
on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after December 1, 2020
for the 2021 Notes. Further, holders of these notes may convert their notes at 
their option prior to the respective dates above, only under the following 
circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the fiscal quarter 
ending June 30, 2014, if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at
least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 30 
consecutive trading days of immediately preceding fiscal quarter is greater than
or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the applicable notes on each 
applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any 
five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 
applicable notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of 
our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we 
make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified 
corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or
deliver as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash
and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon conversion of the 2021 
Notes, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount and, if 
applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in 
lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily 
conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, 
holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 
notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 
the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific 
corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we will increase 
the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection
with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. During the fourth quarter 
of 2016, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of 
the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 
of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other 
conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of 
December 31, 2016. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible 
during the first quarter of 2017 and are classified as long-term debt. Should 
the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future 
quarter, the 2019 and/or the 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ 
option during the immediately following quarter. As of December 31, 2016, the 
if-converted value of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes did not exceed the principal
value of those notes.

As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value and the outstanding principal of our
2019 Notes are $788.0 million and $920.0 million, respectively. As of December 
31, 2015, the carrying value and the outstanding principal of our 2021 Notes are
$1.08 billion and $1.38 billion, respectively.

In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the 
respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option of 
$188.1 million for the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in 
stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2019 Notes and 2021 
Notes are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 
4.89% and 5.96%, respectively, over the contractual terms of the notes.

In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into 
convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase 
initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of 
approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately
$359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was
$524.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the 
warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for 
certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $512.66 for the 2019 Notes and a total of 
approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per 
share for 2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale 
of these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional 
notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and 
paid an aggregate $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 
0.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the 
warrants relating to 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5 million shares
of our common stock at a strike price of $560.64 per share for the warrants 
relating to 2021 Notes. We received aggregate proceeds of approximately $50.8 
million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the 
convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to reduce 
potential dilution and/or offset potential cash payments upon the conversion of 
these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion price from 
$359.87 to $512.66 per share in the case of warrants relating to 2019 Notes and 
from $359.87 to $560.64 in the case of warrants relating to 2021 Notes. As these
transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and 
warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as 
derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge
and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in 
capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 2016.

1.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018 and Bond Hedge and Warrant 
Transactions

In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes 
in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting 
transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million 
of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes and are
amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the 
contractual term of the 2018 Notes. The interest under the 2018 Notes is fixed 
at 1.50% per annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and 
December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes is initially convertible into 8.0306 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of
specified events. Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their 2018 Notes at 
their option on or after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 Notes may 
convert their 2018 Notes at their option prior to March 1, 2018, only under the 
following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the 
fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2013, if the last reported sale price of our
common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during 
the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal quarter
is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each applicable 
trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any five 
consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2018 Notes is 
less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for 
each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make specified 
distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate 
transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay the holders in cash for the 
principal amount of the 2018 Notes and, if applicable, shares of our common 
stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such 
shares of our common stock) based on a calculated daily conversion value. If a 
fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2018 Notes 
may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a 
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes, plus 
any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur
prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder 
who elects to convert its 2018 Notes in connection with such a corporate event 
in certain circumstances.

As of December 31, 2015, the carrying value and the outstanding principal of our
2018 Notes are $612.5 million and $659.8 million, respectively.

In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the 2018 Notes from 
the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $82.8 million in 
stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discount on the 2018 Notes is being 
amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.29% over the 
contractual term of the 2018 Notes.

In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase initially (subject
to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the 
convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold 
warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase 
initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 
million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received 
$120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together,
the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are 
intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and
to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per
share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible 
note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not 
accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the 
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to 
additional paid-in capital on the Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 31, 
2016.

During the fourth quarter of fiscal2016, the closing price of our common stock 
exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 
20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of such quarter; therefore, holders 
of 2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of fiscal 2017. 
As such, we classified the $196.2 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as 
current liabilities and classified $8.8 million, representing the difference 
between the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $205.0 million and the 
carrying value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our Consolidated Balance 
Sheet as of December 31, 2016. Should the closing price conditions be met in a 
future quarter, 2018 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during 
the immediately following quarter.

During fiscal 2016, we repaid $454.7 million in aggregate principal amount of 
our 2018 Notes pursuant to conversions by their holders. As of December 31, 
2016, we had remaining outstanding $205.0 million in aggregate principal amount 
of the 2018 Notes. As of December 31, 2016, there were also outstanding a 
corresponding amount of convertible note hedge transactions, as well as warrants
to issue up to 2.2 million shares at $184.48 per share as of December 31, 2016, 
in each case issued in connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes.

Asset-Based Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit 
agreement (the “ Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The Credit 
Agreement provides for a senior secured asset-based revolving credit facility 
(the “ Credit Facility”), which we may draw upon as needed. In October 2015, 
lenders increased their total funding commitments to us under the Credit 
Facility by up to an additional $250.0 million, subject to certain conditions, 
for total commitments up to $750 million. In addition, the Credit Agreement 
provides for a $200.0 million letter of credit sub-facility and a $40.0 million 
swing-line loan sub-facility. The Credit Agreement is collateralized by a pledge
of certain of our accounts receivable, inventory, and equipment, and 
availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as
reduced by certain reserves. During fiscal 2016, we amended the Credit Agreement
and increased the availability and the commitments under the Credit Agreement 
from $750.0 million to $1.2 billion.

Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus 
LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the 
lenders “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 
0.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly. The Credit Agreement terminates,
and all outstanding loans become due and payable, in June 2020. As of December 
31, 2016, we had $969.0million borrowings under the Credit Facility and zero 
borrowings under the swing-line loan sub-facility.

As of December 31, 2015, we had $135.0 million in borrowings under the Credit 
Facility.

We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting 
requirements, such as the completion and presentation of audited Consolidated 
Financial Statements for our borrowings. As of December 31, 2016 we were in 
compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.

funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 3.25% plus LIBOR or
(b) 2.25% plus the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank 
of America’s published “prime rate” or (iii) LIBOR plus 1.00%. The fee for 
undrawn commitments is 0.375% per annum. The secured revolving credit facility 
is secured by certain of SolarCity’s accounts receivable, inventory, machinery, 
equipment and other assets.

2.75% Convertible Senior Notes Due In 2018

In October 2013, SolarCity issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal of 2.75%
convertible senior notes due on November 1, 2018 through a public offering.

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into
1.7838 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$560.64 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events
related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers. Holders of the 
convertible senior notes may convert their convertible senior notes at their 
option at any time up to and including the second scheduled trading day prior to
maturity. If certain events that would constitute a make-whole fundamental 
change, such as significant changes in ownership, corporate structure or 
tradability of our common stock, occur prior to the maturity date, we would 
increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its convertible 
senior notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. The 
maximum conversion rate is capped at 2.3635 shares for each $1,000 of principal 
of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion 
price of $423.10 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash 
conversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to 
repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined 
fundamental changes.

1.625% Convertible Senior Notes Due in 2019

In September 2014, SolarCity issued $500.0 million and in October 2014, 
SolarCity issued an additional $66.0 million in aggregate principal of 1.625% 
convertible senior notes due on November 1, 2019 through a private placement

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into
1.3169 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$759.36 per share, subject to the same adjustment mechanism as discussed above. 
The maximum conversion rate is capped at 1.7449 shares for each $1,000 of 
principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum 
conversion price of $573.10 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have 
a cash conversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to 
repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined 
fundamental changes.

In connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in September 
2014 and in October 2014, SolarCity entered into capped call option agreements 
to reduce the potential equity dilution upon conversion of the convertible 
senior notes. Specifically, upon the exercise of the capped call options, we 
would now receive shares of our common stock equal to 745,377 shares multiplied 
by (a) (i) the lower of $1,146.18 or the then market price of our common stock 
less (ii) $759.36 and divided by (b) the then market price of our common stock. 
The results of this formula are that we would receive more shares as the market 
price of our common stock exceeds $759.36 and approaches $1,146.18, but we would
receive fewer shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds $1,146.18. 
Consequently, if the convertible senior notes are converted, then the number of 
shares to be issued by us would be effectively partially offset by the shares 
received by us under the capped call options as they are exercised. We can also 
elect to receive the equivalent value of cash in lieu of shares. The capped call
options expire on various dates ranging from September 4, 2019 to October 29, 
2019, and the formula above would be adjusted in the event of a merger; a tender
offer; nationalization; insolvency; delisting of our common stock; changes in 
law; failure to deliver; insolvency filing; stock splits, combinations, 
dividends, repurchases or similar events; or an announcement of certain of the 
preceding actions. Although intended to reduce the net number of shares issued 
after a conversion of the convertible senior notes, the capped call options were
separately negotiated transactions, are not a part of the terms of the 
convertible senior notes, do not affect the rights of the convertible senior 
note holders and will take effect regardless of whether the convertible senior 
notes are actually converted. The capped call options meet the criteria for 
equity classification because they are indexed to our common stock and we always
control whether settlement will be in shares or cash.

Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes Due in 2020

In December 2015, SolarCity issued $113.0 million in aggregate principal of 
zero-coupon convertible senior notes due on December 1, 2020 through a private 
placement. $13.0 million of the convertible senior notes were issued to related 
parties and are separately presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see 
Note 21, Related Party Transactions).

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into
3.3333 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$300.00 per share, subject to the same adjustment mechanism as discussed above. 
The maximum conversion rate is capped at 4.2308 shares for each $1,000 of 
principal of the convertible senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum 
conversion price of $236.36 per share. The convertible senior notes do not have 
a cash conversion option. The convertible senior note holders may require us to 
repurchase their convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined 
fundamental changes. On or after June 30, 2017, the convertible senior notes 
will be redeemable by us in the event that the closing price of our common stock
exceeds 200% of the conversion price for 45 consecutive trading days ending 
within three trading days of such redemption notice at a redemption price of par
plus accrued and unpaid interest to, but excluding, the redemption date

Solar Bonds

In October 2014, SolarCity commenced issuing Solar Bonds, which are senior 
unsecured obligations of SolarCity that are structurally subordinate to the 
indebtedness and other liabilities of SolarCity’s subsidiaries. Solar Bonds have
been issued under multiple series that have various fixed terms and interest 
rates. In September 2015, SolarCity commenced issuing Solar Bonds with variable 
interest rates that reset quarterly and that can be redeemed quarterly at the 
option of the bondholder or us, with 30-day advance notice.

In March 2016, Space Exploration Technologies Corporation, or SpaceX, purchased 
$90.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 4.40% Solar Bonds due in March 
2017. In June 2016, SpaceX purchased an additional $75.0 million in aggregate 
principal amount of 4.40% Solar Bonds due in June 2017.

In August 2016, our Chief Executive Officer, SolarCity’s Chief Executive Officer
and SolarCity’s Chief Technology Officer purchased $100.0 million in aggregate 
principal amount of 6.50% Solar Bonds due in February 2018

SpaceX, our Chief Executive Officer, SolarCity’s Chief Executive Officer and 
SolarCity’s Chief Technology Officer were considered related parties; SolarCity 
has also issued Solar Bonds to other related parties; and such Solar Bonds are 
separately presented on the Consolidated Balance Sheets (see Note 21, Related 
Party Transactions).

Non-Recourse Debt Facilities

Canada Credit Agreement

In December 2016, we entered into a Credit Agreement with Royal Bank of Canada 
(the “ Canada Credit Agreement”). Under the Credit Agreement, we borrowed $67.3 
million which is secured by an interest in certain vehicle leases. Amount drawn 
under the Canada Credit agreement has a rate range of 3.6% to 4.5% and are 
subject to variouscustomary events of default, covenants and limitations, 
including an advance rate limit and a required reserve account. The term of the 
loan is reflective of the term of the underlying vehicle leases, up to 48 
months.

Warehouse Agreement

In August 2016, we entered into a Loan and Security Agreement (the “ Warehouse 
Agreement”) with Deutsche Bank as administrative agent and a committed lender. 
Under the Warehouse Agreement, which supports the Tesla Finance direct vehicle 
leasing program, and is secured by an interest in certain leases and vehicles 
under such program, we were initially entitled to borrow up to $300.0 million in
total principal amount. In December 2016, we amended the Warehouse Agreement and
increased the total facility limit to $600.0 million. Subject to extension in 
accordance with the terms of the Warehouse Agreement, the ability to draw under 
the Warehouse Agreement expires on August 31, 2017, and the full amount 
outstanding under the Warehouse Agreement is due September 20, 2018. As of 
December 31, 2016, we had $390.0million in borrowings outstanding under the 
Warehouse Agreement.

Amounts drawn under the Warehouse Agreement generally bear interest at a rate 
based on LIBOR plus a fixed margin. We are subject to various customary events 
of default and financial, lease portfolio performance and other covenants and 
limitations, including an advance rate limit, a required reserve account, and 
various performance triggers and excess concentration limits.

Pursuant to the Warehouse Agreement, an undivided beneficial interest in the 
future cash flows arising from certain leases and the related leased vehicles 
has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in our 
consolidated financial statements. The interest in the future cash flows arising
from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims of
our creditors other than pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the 
Warehouse Agreement. We retain the right to receive the excess cash flows not 
needed to pay obligations under the Warehouse Agreement.

Solar Asset-backed Notes, Series 2013-1

In November 2013, SolarCity pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy 
systems and the associated customer contracts into a Special Purpose Entity 
(SPE) and issued $54.4 million in aggregate principal of Solar Asset-backed 
Notes, Series 2013-1, backed by these solar assets to investors. The SPE is 
wholly owned by SolarCity and is consolidated in our financial statements. As of
December 31, 2016, these solar assets had a carrying value of $93.0 million and 
are included under solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Solar Asset-backed Notes were issued at a 
discount of 0.05%. The cash flows generated by these solar assets are used to 
service the monthly principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed 
Notes and satisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to a
wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We recognize revenue earned from the associated
customer contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPE’s 
assets and cash flows are not available to the other creditors of ours, and the 
creditors of the SPE, including the Solar Asset-backed Note holders, have no 
recourse to our other assets. SolarCity contracted with the SPE to provide 
operations and maintenance and administrative services for the qualifying solar 
energy systems.

In connection with the pooling of the assets that were transferred to the SPE in
November 2013, SolarCity terminated a lease pass-through arrangement with an 
investor. The lease pass-through arrangement had been accounted for as a 
borrowing and any amounts outstanding from the lease pass-through arrangement 
were recorded as a lease pass-through financing obligation. The balance that was
then outstanding from the lease pass-through arrangement was $56.4 million. 
SolarCity paid the investor an aggregate of $40.2 million, and the remaining 
balance is to be paid over time. The remaining balance is paid using the net 
cash flows generated by the same assets previously leased under the lease 
pass-through arrangement, after payment of the principal and interest on the 
Solar Asset-backed Notes and expenses related to the assets and the Notes, 
including asset management fees, custodial fees and trustee fees, and was 
contractually documented as a right to participate in future cash flows of the 
SPE. This right to participate in future residual cash flows generated by the 
assets of the SPE (Participating interest) has been recorded as a component of 
other long-term liabilities for the noncurrent portion and as a component of 
accrued liabilities for the current portion. We account for the participation 
interest as a liability because the investor has no voting or management rights 
in the SPE, the participation interest would terminate upon the investor 
achieving a specified return and the investor has the option to put the 
participation interest to us on August 3, 2021 for the amount necessary for the 
investor to achieve the specified return, which would require us to settle the 
participation interest in cash. In addition, under the terms of the 
participation interest, we have the option to purchase the participation 
interest from the investor for the amount necessary for the investor to achieve 
the specified return.

Solar Asset-backed Notes, 2014-1

assets had a carrying value of $113.6 million and are included under solar 
energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, in the Consolidated Balance 
Sheets. The Solar Asset-backed Notes were issued at a discount of 0.01%. The 
cash flows generated by these solar assets are used to service the monthly 
principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the 
SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to a wholly owned 
subsidiary of ours. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer 
contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPE’s assets 
and cash flows are not available to the other creditors of ours, and the 
creditors of the SPE, including the Solar Asset-backed Note holders, have no 
recourse to our other assets. SolarCity contracted with the SPE to provide

2016, these solar assets had a carrying value of $265.6 million and are included
under solar energy systems, leased and to be leased - net, in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets. The Solar Asset-backed Notes were issued at a discount of 0.01%.
These solar assets and the associated customer contracts are leased to an 
investor under a lease pass-through arrangement that we have accounted for as a 
borrowing. The rent paid by the investor under the lease pass-through 
arrangement is used (and, following the expiration of the lease pass-through 
arrangement, the cash generated by these solar assets will be used) to service 
the semi-annual principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes 
and satisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to a 
wholly owned subsidiary of ours. We recognize revenue earned from the associated
customer contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPE’s 
assets and cash flows are not available to the other creditors of ours, and the 
creditors of the SPE, including the Solar Asset-backed Note holders, have no 
recourse to our other assets. SolarCity contracted with the SPE to provide 
operations and maintenance and administrative services for certain of the 
qualifying solar energy systems.

distributed by the underlying financing funds to the SPE are used to service the
semi-annual principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and 
satisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to a wholly 
owned subsidiary of ours. The SPE’s assets and cash flows are not available to

our financial statements. As of December 31, 2016, these solar assets had a 
carrying value of $87.7 million and are included under solar energy systems, 
leased and to be leased, net, in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Solar 
Asset-backed Notes were issued at a discount of 6.71%. These solar assets and 
the associated customer contracts are leased to an investor under a lease 
pass-through arrangement that we have accounted for as a borrowing. The rent 
paid by the investor under the lease pass-through arrangement is used (and, 
following the expiration of the lease pass-through arrangement, the cash 
generated by these solar assets will be used) to service the semi-annual 
principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the 
SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to a wholly owned 
subsidiary of ours. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer 
contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPE’s assets 
and cash flows are not available to the other creditors of ours, and the
