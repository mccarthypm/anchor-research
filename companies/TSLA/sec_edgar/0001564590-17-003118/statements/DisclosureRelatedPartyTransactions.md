The related party transactions were primarily issuances and maturities of Solar 
Bonds held by SpaceX, our Chief Executive Officer, SolarCity’s Chief Executive 
Officer, and SolarCity’s Chief Technology Officer and issuances of convertible 
senior notes to an entity affiliated with our Chief Executive Officer and 
SolarCity’s Chief Executive Officer. SpaceX is considered a related party 
because our Chief Executive Officer is the Chief Executive Officer, Chief 
Technology Officer, Chairman, and a significant stockholder of SpaceX.

As of December 31, 2016, SpaceX held $90.0 million in aggregate principal amount
of 4.40% Solar Bonds due in March 2017 and $75.0 million in aggregate principal 
amount of 4.40% Solar Bonds due in June 2017. In addition, our Chief Executive 
Officer, SolarCity’s Chief Executive Officer, and SolarCity’s Chief Technology 
Officer collectively held $100.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 6.50% 
Solar Bonds due in February 2018.

From the Acquisition Date through December 31, 2016, the interest expense 
recognized for debt held by related parties was not material.
