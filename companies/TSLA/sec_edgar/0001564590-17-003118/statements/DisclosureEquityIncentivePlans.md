| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 15 - Equity Incentive Plans

In 2010, we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”). The 2010 
Plan provides for the granting of stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights 
to our employees, directors and consultants. Options granted under the 2010 Plan
may be either incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock 
options may be granted only to our employees including officers and directors. 
Nonqualified stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our 
employees and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four 
years and are exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of 
ten years from the date the stock options are granted. Continued vesting 
typically terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends. In 
addition, as a result of our acquisition of SolarCity, we have assumed its 
equity award plans, and its outstanding equity awards as of the Acquisition 
Date. The equity awards of SolarCity were converted into equity awards to 
acquire Tesla common stock in share amounts and prices based on the Exchange 
Ratio, with the equity awards retaining the same vesting and other terms and 
conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition. The vesting and 
other terms and conditions of the assumed equity awards are substantially the 
same as those of the 2010 Plan.

As of December 31, 2016, 4,698,501 of common shares were reserved and available 
for future issuance under the 2010 Plan.

The following table summarizes stock option and RSU activity under the 2010 
Plan:

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i. 
e., the difference between our common stock price and the exercise price, 
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received 
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options. The total 
intrinsic value of options exercised was $1.68 billion, $395.6 million and 
$446.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Fair Value Assumptions

We utilize the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation 
expense. Under the fair value method, we estimated the fair value of each option
award and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model and the weighted-average assumptions noted in the following table.

The risk-free interest rate that we use is based on the United States Treasury 
yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon United States Treasury 
notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Given our 
limited history with employee grants, we use the “simplified” method in 
estimating the expected term for our employee grants. The “simplified” method, 
as permitted by the SEC Staff, is calculated as the average of the 
time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the options.

Beginning in 2015, our expected volatility is derived from our implied 
volatility on publicly traded options of our common stock and the historical 
volatility of our common stock. Prior to 2015, our expected volatility was 
derived from our implied volatility on publicly traded options of our common 
stock and the historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies 
within industries related to our business, including the automotive OEM, 
automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology industries, because 
we had limited trading history on our common stock. When making the selections 
of our peer companies within industries related to our business to be used in 
the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size 
and financial leverage of potential comparable companies. Our historical 
volatility and implied volatility are weighted based on certain qualitative 
factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for option awards granted during the 
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $98.7, $108.28 and $94.01 per 
share. The weighted-average grant-date fair value for ESPP granted during the 
years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $51.31, $58.77 and $74.07 per 
share. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing
fair market value of our common stock.

2014 Performance-based Stock Options Grants

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in 
the achievement of significant milestones by our Company, the Compensation 
Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock options to certain employees 
to purchase an aggregate 1,073,000 shares of our common stock. Each such grant 
consists of four vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of future performance milestones, assuming continued employment and 
service to us through each vesting date.

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
achieving aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 
12-month period;  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle; and  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
achievement of annualized gross margin of greater than 30.0% in any three years 

As of December 31, 2016, the following performance milestone was achieved and 
approved by our Board of Directors.

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle  

As of December 31, 2016, the following performance milestone was considered 
probable of achievement.

  Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle; and  

  Achieving aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 
12-month period  

We begin recording stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable. As of December 31, 2016, we had unrecognized compensation expense of 
$17.5 million for those performance milestones that were not considered probable
of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we 
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $25.3 million, $10.4 million and 
$10.7 million related to this grant.

2012 CEO Grant

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock options to our 
CEO (the “2012 CEO Grant”). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of ten vesting tranches 
with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance 
conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service to 
us through each vesting date.

Each of the ten vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten 
pre-determined performance milestones and an incremental increase in our market 
capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial market capitalization
of $3.2 billion measured at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant.

As of December 31, 2016, the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and 
the following five performance milestones were achieved and approved by our 
Board of Directors:

  Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles; and  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype.  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

As of December 31, 2016, the following performance milestones were considered 
probable of achievement:

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle;  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 200,000 vehicles; and  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 300,000 vehicles.  

We expect that the next performance milestone to be achieved will be the 
successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype, which would be achieved 
upon the determination by our Board of Directors that an eligible prototype has 
been completed. Candidates for such prototype are among the vehicles that we are
currently building as part of our ongoing testing of our Model 3 vehicle design 
and manufacturing processes.

We begin recording stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable. As of December 31, 2016, we had $4.9 million of total unrecognized 
compensation expense for those performance milestones that were considered 
probable of achievement and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of
2.3 years. As of December 31, 2016, we had unrecognized compensation expense of 
$6.1 million for those performance milestones that were not considered probable 
of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014, we 
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $15.8 million, $10.6 million and 
$25.0 million.

requirements under California law, and he is subject to income taxes based on 
such base salary. However, he has never accepted and currently does not

$         197,999      $         156,496  

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the 
periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances.

As of December 31, 2016, we had $772.9 million of total unrecognized 
compensation expense, net, of estimated forfeitures, related to non-performance 
awards that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 2.8 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Employees are eligible to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up
to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The 
purchase price of the shares on each purchase date is equal to 85% of the lower 
of the fair market value of our common stock on the first and last trading days 
of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 
2015 and 2014, we issued 321,788, 220,571 and 163,600 shares under the ESPP for 
$51.7 million, $37.5 million and $28.6 million, respectively. A total of 
3,615,749 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP,
and there were 1,794,063 shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of 
December 31, 2016.
