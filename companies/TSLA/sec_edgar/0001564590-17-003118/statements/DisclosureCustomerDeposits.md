| **  Customer Deposits** | Note 12 - Customer Deposits

Customer deposits primarily consist of cash payments from customers at the time 
they place an order for a vehicle and additional payments up to the point of 
delivery including the fair value of customer trade-in vehicles that are 
applicable toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposit amounts and timing 
vary depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery. Customer deposits 
are fully refundable up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production 
cycle. Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded or 
until they are applied to a customer’s purchase balance at time of delivery.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, we held $663.9 million and $283.4 million in 
customer deposits. The increase is primarily due to Model 3 deposits.
