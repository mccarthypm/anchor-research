Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer 
orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale at our retail and service 
center locations, pre-owned Tesla vehicles, and energy storage products.

For solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, we commence transferring 
component parts from inventory to construction in progress, a component of solar
energy systems, leased and to be leased, once a lease contract with a customer 
has been executed and installation has been initiated. Additional costs incurred
on the leased systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within 
construction in progress.

We write down inventory as a result of excess and obsolete inventories, or when 
we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the 
carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we 
recorded write-downs of $52.8 million, $44.9 million and $15.6 million in cost 
of revenues.
