Operating Leases

We have entered into various non-cancelable operating lease agreements for 
certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and 
service locations, equipment, vehicles, solar energy systems and supercharger 
sites, throughout the world with various expiration dates throughDecember2030.

Included within Operating Leases commitments in the table below are payments due
under operating leases that have been accounted for as build-to-suit 
arrangements and are included in property, plant, and equipment in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 was $116.8 
million, $68.2 million and $46.3 million.

Capital Leases for Equipment

We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases 
up to 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease 
obligations and are included within property, plant and equipment, net on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets under the categories of computer equipment and 
software and office furniture and equipment.

Future minimum commitments for leases as of December 31, 2016 are as follows (in
thousands):

Build-to-Suit Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

As discussed in Note 8, Property, Plant and Equipment, as part of the SolarCity 
acquisition, we assumed a build-to-suit lease arrangement with the Research 
Foundation for the State University of New York, or the Foundation, where the 
Foundation will construct the manufacturing facility and install certain 
utilities and other improvements, with our participation in the design and 
construction of the manufacturing facility, and acquire certain manufacturing 
equipment designated by us to be used in the manufacturing facility. The 
Foundation will cover (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing 
facility in an amount up to $350.0 million, (ii) the acquisition and 
commissioning of the manufacturing equipment in an amount up to $348.1 million 
and (iii) $51.9 million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and 
(ii) only, subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of New York,
and we will be responsible for any construction and equipment costs in excess of
such amounts. We will own the manufacturing facility and manufacturing equipment
purchased by the Foundation. Following completion of the manufacturing facility,
we will lease the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing equipment owned 
by the Foundation from the Foundation for an initial period of 10 years, with an
option to renew, for $2 per year plus utilities.

Under the terms of the build-to-suit lease arrangement, we are required to 
achieve specific operational milestones during the initial term of the lease, 
which include employing a certain number of employees at the facility, within 
western New York and within the State of New York within specified time periods 
following the completion of the facility. We are also required to spend or incur
approximately $5.0 billion in combined capital, operational expenses and other 
costs in the State of New York over the 10 years following the achievement of 
full production. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured 
on each anniversary of the commissioning of the facility, if we fail to meet its
specified investment and job creation obligations, then we would be obligated to
pay a $41.2 million “program payment” to the Foundation for each year that we 
fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the agreement is terminated due
to a material breach by us, then additional amounts might be payable by us.

Due to our involvement with the construction of the facility, our exposure to 
any potential cost overruns and its other commitments under the agreement, we 
are deemed to be the owner of the facility and the manufacturing equipment owned
by the Foundation for accounting purposes during the construction phase. 
Accordingly, as of December 31, 2016, we recorded a non-cash build-to-suit lease
asset under construction of $783.9 million, and a corresponding build-to-suit 
lease liability on our consolidated balance sheets. The non-cash investing and 
financing activities related to the arrangement from the Acquisition Date 
through December 31, 2016 amounted to $5.6 million.

Environmental Liabilities

In connection with our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California, we are 
obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions 
existing at the time we purchased the property from New United Motor 
Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Tesla is responsible for the first $15 million of 
remediation costs and any costs in excess of $30 million or costs incurred after
the ten-year anniversary of closing. NUMMI is responsible for remediation costs 
between $15 million and $30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from 
the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third 
parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the 
form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were 
to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our 
results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.

In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against 
Tesla in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging 
violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint made claims 
against Tesla and our CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney’s fees on the 
basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false 
and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the 
safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class 
consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla’s securities between August 
19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the
motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and 
thereafter issued a formal written order to that effect. The plaintiffs appealed
from the trial court’s order, and on December 21, 2016, the Court of Appeals 
affirmed the trial court’s decision dismissing the complaint with prejudice.

On March 28, 2014, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity 
and two of its officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities 
laws, and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a
purported class of purchasers of SolarCity’s securities from March 6, 2013 to 
March 18, 2014. After a series of amendments to the original complaint, the 
District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in 
SolarCity’s favor on August 9, 2016. The plaintiffs have filed a notice of 
appeal. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend 
against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss, if
any, associated with this lawsuit.

On August 15, 2016, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in 
the United States District Court for the Northern District of California against
SolarCity, two of its officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges that 
SolarCity made projections of future sales and installations that it failed to 
achieve and that these projections were fraudulent when made. The plaintiffs 
claim violations of federal securities laws and seek unspecified compensatory 
damages and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of 
SolarCity’s securities from May 5, 2015 to February 16, 2016. We believe that 
the claims are without merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We 
are unable to estimate the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the 
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla 
challenging Tesla’s acquisition of SolarCity. On October 10, the Court entered 
orders consolidating these lawsuits and appointing lead plaintiffs and lead 
counsel. The consolidated lawsuit is captioned as In re Tesla Motors, Inc., 
Stockholders Litigation, C. A. No. 12711-VCS. It names as defendants the members
of Tesla’s board of directors and alleges, among other things, that the members 
of Tesla’s board of directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with
the SolarCity acquisition. It asserts claims derivatively on behalf of Tesla and
directly on behalf of a putative class of Tesla stockholders. It seeks, among 
other relief, damages in an unspecified amount and attorneys’ fees and costs. On
January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. 
After receiving the motion, plaintiffs indicated that they intend to file an 
amended complaint rather than respond to the defendants’ motion to dismiss. 
Tesla believes that the lawsuit is without merit.

In July 2012, SolarCity, along with other companies in the solar energy 
industry, received a subpoena from the U. S. Treasury Department’s Office of the
Inspector General to deliver certain documents in SolarCity’s possession that 
were dated, created, revised or referred to after January 1, 2007 and that 
relate to SolarCity’s applications for U. S. Treasury grants or communications 
with certain other solar energy development companies or with certain firms that
appraise solar energy property for U. S Treasury grant application purposes. The
Inspector General and the Civil Division of the U. S. Department of Justice are 
investigating the administration and implementation of the U. S Treasury grant 
program relating to the fair market value of the solar energy systems that 
SolarCity submitted in U. S. Treasury grant applications. SolarCity has accrued 
a reserve for its potential liability associated with this ongoing investigation
as of December 31, 2016.

In February 2013, two of SolarCity’s financing funds filed a lawsuit in the 
United States Court of Federal Claims against the United States government, 
seeking to recover approximately $14.0 million that the United States Treasury 
was obligated to pay, but failed to pay, under Section 1603 of the American 
Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In February 2016, the government filed a 
motion seeking leave to assert a counterclaim against the two plaintiff funds on
the grounds that the government, in fact, paid them more, not less, than they 
were entitled to as a matter of law. We believe that the government’s claims are
without merit and expect the plaintiff funds to litigate the case vigorously. 
Trial in the case is set for the latter half of 2017. We are unable to estimate 
the possible loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

From time to time, we have received requests for information from regulators and
governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings that
arise from the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to 
time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against
us in the form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable 
ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact 
on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and 
brand.

Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns

As disclosed in Note18, VIE Arrangements, and Note 19, Lease Pass-Through 
Financing Obligation, we are contractually committed to compensate certain fund 
investors for any losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances 
resulting from reductions in U. S. Treasury grants or ITCs. Generally, such 
obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying
solar energy systems as assessed by the U. S. Treasury Department for purposes 
of claiming U. S. Treasury grants or as assessed by the IRS for purposes of 
claiming ITCs or U. S. Treasury grants. For each balance sheet date, we assess 
and recognize, when applicable, the potential exposure from this obligation 
based on all the information available at that time, including any guidelines 
issued by the U. S. Treasury Department on solar energy system valuations for 
purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants and any audits undertaken by the IRS.
We believe that any payments to the fund investors in excess of the amount 
already recognized by us for this obligation are not probable based on the facts
known at the reporting date.

The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this 
obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar 
energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the 
values that the U. S. Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the 
systems for purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants or the values the IRS 
would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs 
or U. S. Treasury grants. We claim U. S. Treasury grants based on guidelines 
provided by the U. S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the
IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent 
third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs 
that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot 
determine future revisions to U. S. Treasury Department guidelines governing 
system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in claiming ITCs 
or U. S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably estimate the maximum 
potential future payments that it could have to make under this obligation as of
each balance sheet date.

We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are 
associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can 
be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or 
the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one 
state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the 
tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives 
received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the 
contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to 
indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in 
the amount of state or local incentives actually received.

As disclosed in Note 18, we are contractually required to make payments to one 
fund investor to ensure that the fund investor achieves a specified minimum 
internal rate of return. The fund investor has already received a significant 
portion of the projected economic benefits from U. S. Treasury grant 
distributions and tax depreciation benefits. The contractual provisions of the 
fund state that the fund has an indefinite term unless the members agree to 
dissolve the fund. Based on our current financial projections regarding the 
amount and timing of future distributions to the fund investor, we do not expect
to make any payments as a result of this guarantee and has not accrued any 
liabilities for this guarantee. The amount of potential future payments under 
this guarantee is dependent on the amount and timing of future distributions to 
the fund investor and future tax benefits that accrue to the fund investor. Due 
to the uncertainties surrounding estimating the amounts of these factors, we are
unable to estimate the maximum potential payments under this guarantee. To date,
the fund investor has achieved the specified minimum internal rate of return as 
determined in accordance with the contractual provisions of the fund.

As disclosed in Note 19, the lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time 
lease payment reset mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar 
energy systems in a fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to 
refund master lease prepayments previously received from investors. Any refunds 
of master lease prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing 
obligation.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2016, we had $105.1 million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
