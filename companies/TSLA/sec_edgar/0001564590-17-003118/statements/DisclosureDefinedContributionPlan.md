| **  Defined Contribution Plan** | Note 20 - Defined Contribution Plan

We have a 401(k) savings plan (“the 401(k) plan”) which qualifies as a deferred 
salary arrangement under section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 
401(k) plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their
eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. We assumed the SolarCity 
401(k) plan, or the Retirement Plan, available to employees who meet the 
Retirement Plan’s eligibility requirements. Participants may elect to contribute
a percentage of their compensation to the Retirement Plan, up to a statutory 
limit. Participants are fully vested in their contributions. We did not make any
contributions to the Retirement Plan during the years ended December 31, 2016, 
2015 and 2014.
