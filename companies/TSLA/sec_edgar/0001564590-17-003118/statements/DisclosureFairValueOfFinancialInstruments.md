| **  Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, clarifies that fair value is an exit price, 
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As 
such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based 
on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a 
liability.

As a basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and 
liabilities, we follow a three-tier fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the 
inputs used in measuring fair value as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such
as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted 
prices in active markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and 
(Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no market data which
requires us to develop our own assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use 
observable market data, when available, and to minimize the use of unobservable 
inputs when determining fair value. Our financial assets and financial 
liabilities that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash
equivalents, marketable securities and interest rate swaps.

As of December 31, 2016 and 2015, the fair value hierarchy for our financial 
assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows, 
and unrealized gains (losses) on financial assets and liabilities presented in 
the table below for all periods presented were less than $1.0 million (in 
thousands):

All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised 
primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value
hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices 
for identical securities. Our restricted short-term marketable securities are 
classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy.

We have classified the interest rate swaps within Level II because their fair 
values are determined using alternative pricing sources or models that utilized 
market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates.

During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, there were no transfers 
between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

Derivative Financial Instruments

Cash Flow Hedges

In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency 
exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in 
Japanese yen. The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward 
contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 
months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or 
speculative purposes.

The bank counterparties in all contracts expose Tesla to credit-related losses 
in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, Tesla only
contracts with counterparties who meet the Company’s minimum requirements under 
its counterparty risk assessment process. Tesla monitors ratings, credit 
spreads, and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our 
on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Company will adjust its exposure 
to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, 
which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the 
same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in 
place with collateral features.

We document each hedge relationship and assess its initial effectiveness at the 
inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a 
quarterly basis using regression analysis. During the term of an effective hedge
contract, we record gains and losses within accumulated other comprehensive 
income (loss). We reclassify these gains or losses to costs of automotive 
revenues in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold or as cost 
of automotive leasing revenue over the depreciation period for those sales 
accounted for as leases. Although our contracts are considered effective hedges,
we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness due to timing differences 
between our actual inventory purchases and the settlement date of the related 
foreign currency forward contracts. We have recorded no amounts related to hedge
ineffectiveness within other income (expense), net in our Consolidated 
Statements of Operations, during the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015.

There were no outstanding hedging contracts as of December 31, 2016. The net 
notional amount of these contracts was $322.6 million at December 31, 2015. 
Outstanding contracts are recognized as either assets or liabilities on the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value within prepaid expenses and other 
current assets or within accrued liabilities and other, depending on our net 
position. The net gain of $5.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss) as of December 31, 2016, is expected to be recognized to costs of 
automotive sales in the period the related finished goods inventory is sold or 
over the depreciation period for those sales accounted for as leases in the next
twelve months. The total fair values of foreign currency contracts designated as
cash flow hedges as of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 was zero and $7.3
million and was determined using Level II inputs and recorded in prepaid 
expenses and other current assets on our Consolidated Balance Sheets. During the
year ended December 31, 2016, we reclassified $44.9 million of gains from 
accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) into cost of automotive revenue. 
No amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
into earnings for the year ended December 31, 2015.

Interest Rate Swaps

SolarCity enters into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap 
variable interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments, as 
required by its lenders. These interest rate swaps are not designated as hedging
instruments. Accordingly, all interest rate swaps are recognized at fair value 
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets within other assets or other long-term 
liabilities, with any changes in fair value recognized as other income 
(expense), net in our Consolidated Statements of Operations and with any cash 
flows recognized as investing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash 
flows. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate notional amount of these interest 
rate swaps, the gross asset at fair value, and the gross liability at fair value
was $789.6 million, $10.6 million, and $12.1 million, respectively. During the 
year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $7.0 million of gains related to 
these interest rate swaps.

Fair Value Disclosure

Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include 
accounts receivable, customer notes receivable, rebates receivable, accounts 
payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits, convertible senior notes, 
participation interest, solar asset-backed notes, solar loan-backed notes, Solar
Bonds and long-term debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments 
other than customer notes receivable, convertible senior notes, the 
participation interest, solar asset-backed notes, Solar Bonds, and long-term 
debt approximated their fair value.

We estimate the fair value of convertible senior notes based on acommonly 
accepted valuation methodology and market-based risk measurements that are 
indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate 
the fair value of customer notes receivable, the participation interest, solar 
asset-backed notes, solar loan-backed notes and Solar Bonds based on rates 
currently offered for instruments with similar maturities and terms (Level III).
The following table presents their estimated fair values and their carrying 
values (in thousands):
