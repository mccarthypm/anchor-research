| **  Acquisition of SolarCity** | Note 3 - Acquisition of SolarCity

Transaction Overview

On November 21, 2016 (the “ Acquisition Date”), we completed our acquisition of 
SolarCity. As of the acquisition date, our CEO was the chair of SolarCity’s 
Board of Directors. Pursuant to the Agreement and Plan of Merger (the “ Merger 
Agreement”), each issued and outstanding share of SolarCity common stock was 
converted into 0.110 (the “ Exchange Ratio”) shares of Tesla common stock. 
SolarCity options and restricted stock unit awards were assumed by Tesla and 
converted into corresponding equity awards in respect of Tesla common stock 
based on the Exchange Ratio, with the awards retaining the same vesting and 
other terms and conditions as in effect immediately prior to the acquisition.

Fair Value of Consideration Transferred

The acquisition date fair value of the consideration transferred totaled $2.1 
billion, which consisted of the following (in thousands, except for share and 
per share amounts):

  Total fair value of Tesla common stock                              $2,058,477
  Fair value of replacement Tesla stock                                   87,500
  Total purchase price                                                $2,145,977

In addition, we also assumed unvested SolarCity awards of $95.9 million which 
will be recognized as stock-based compensation expense over the remaining 
requisite service period. Per ASC 805, Business Combinations, the replacement of
stock options or other share-based payment awards in conjunction with a business
combination represents a modification of share-based payment awards that must be
accounted for in accordance with ASC 718, Compensation - Stock Compensation. As 
a result of our obligation to issue replacement awards, a portion of the 
fair-value-based measure of replacement awards is included in measuring the 
purchase consideration transferred in the business combination. To determine the
portion of the replacement awards that is part of the purchase consideration, we
measured the fair value of both the replacement awards and the historical awards
as of the Acquisition Date, in accordance with ASC 718. The fair value of the 
replacement awards, whether vested or unvested, was included in the purchase 
consideration to the extent that pre-acquisition services had been rendered.

Transaction costs of $21.7 million were expensed as incurred in selling, general
and administrative expense of our Consolidated Statements of Operations.

Fair Value of Assets Acquired and Liabilities Assumed

We accounted for the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting for 
business combinations under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The total purchase 
price is allocated to the tangible and identifiable intangible assets acquired 
and liabilities and noncontrolling interests assumed based on their estimated 
fair values as of the Acquisition Date.

As we finalize the fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed, 
additional purchase price adjustments may be recorded during the measurement 
period (a period not to exceed 12 months) in 2017. Fair value estimates are 
based on a complex series of judgments about future events and uncertainties and
rely heavily on estimates and assumptions. The judgments used to determine the 
estimated fair value assigned to each class of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed, as well as asset lives and the expected future cash flows and related 
discount rates, can materiality impact our results of operations. Specifically, 
we used discounted cash flows model to value the acquired solar energy systems, 
leased and to be leased, as well as the noncontrolling interests in 
subsidiaries. Significant inputs used for the model included the amount of cash 
flows, the expected period of the cash flows and the discount rates. The 
finalization of the purchase accounting assessment may result in a change in the
valuation of asset acquired, liabilities assumed and taxes may have a material 
impact on our results of operations and financial position.

The preliminary allocation of the purchase price is based on management’s 
estimate of the acquisition-date fair values of the assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed, as follows (in thousands):

The total preliminary purchase allocation reflects our preliminary estimates and
is subject to revision as additional information in relation to the fair value 
of the inventories, solar energy systems, leased to be leased, identifiable 
intangible assets, deferred revenue, deferred taxes, and noncontrolling 
interests assumed becomes available.

Gain on acquisition

The accounting guidance requires that a gain resulting from the fair value of 
acquired net assets being greater than the consideration paid to acquire the net
assets be recorded as a gain included in the results of operations on the 
acquisition date. We recognized a gain on acquisition of $88.7 million in the 
fourth quarter of 2016, which is recorded in other income (expense), net on our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

We reassessed the recognition and measurement of identifiable assets and 
liabilities acquired and concluded that all acquired assets and liabilities were
recognized and that the valuation procedures and resulting estimates of fair 
values were appropriate. The primary factor contributing to the gain relates to 
the change in the overall price of our common stock from the time that the 
Merger Agreement was executed on July 31, 2016 to the acquisition date. During 
this time, our stock price decreased from $230.01 to $185.04, which in turn 
reduced the fair value of the consideration.

Identifiable intangible assets

A preliminary assessment of the fair value of identified intangible assets and 
their respective useful lives are as follows (in thousands, except for estimated
useful life):

                                           As of December 31, 2016

Acquired in-process research and development (IPR& D) is an intangible asset 
accounted for as an indefinite-lived asset until the completion or abandonment 
of the associated research and development effort. If the research and 
development effort associated with the IPR& D is successfully completed and 
commercial feasibility is reached, then the IPR& D intangible asset will be 
amortized over its estimated useful life to be determined at the date the effort
is completed. The research and development efforts associated with these IPR& D 
intangible assets are expected to be completed in the second half of 2017. The 
fair value of the IPR& D is determined using the replacement cost method under 
the cost approach. The replacement cost is estimated based on the historical 
acquisition cost of the technology and historical R& D expenses incurred, 
adjusted for an estimated developer’s profit, opportunity cost and obsolescence 
factor in accordance with accepted valuation methodologies. At the time of 
acquisition, we expect that all acquired IPR& D will reach technological 
feasibility, but there can be no assurance that the commercial viability of 
these products will actually be achieved. The nature of the efforts to develop 
the acquired technologies into commercially viable products consists principally
of planning, designing, and testing the technology for viability in 
manufacturing. If commercial viability were not achieved, we would likely look 
to other alternative technologies. If the related R& D project is not completed 
in a timely manner or the R& D project is terminated or abandoned, we may have 
an impairment related to the IPR& D, calculated as the excess of the asset’s 
carrying value over its fair value.

Unaudited Pro Forma Financial Information

Our consolidated financial statements for 2016 include SolarCity’s results of 
operations from the Acquisition Date through December 31, 2016. Net revenues and
operating loss attributable to SolarCity during this period and included in our 
consolidated financial statements were $84.1 million and $68.2 million, 
respectively.

The following unaudited pro forma information gives effect to the acquisition of
SolarCity as if the acquisition had occurred on January 1, 2015 and had been 
included in our Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2015 and 2016.

The unaudited pro forma financial information includes adjustments to give

The pro forma financial information includes adjustments to amortization and 
depreciation for solar energy systems, leased to be leased, intangible assets 
acquired, the effect of acquisition on deferred revenue and noncontrolling 
interests, and transaction costs related to the acquisition. The unaudited pro 
forma financial information is presented for illustrative purposes only and is
