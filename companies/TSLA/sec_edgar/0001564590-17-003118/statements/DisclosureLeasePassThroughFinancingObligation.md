| **  Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation** | Note 19 - Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation

Through December 31, 2016, SolarCity had entered into eight transactions 
referred to as “lease pass-through fund arrangements.” Under these arrangements,
our wholly owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with 
investors through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an 
initial term ranging between 10 and 25 years. These solar energy systems are 
subject to lease or power purchase agreements with customers with an initial 
term not exceeding 20 years. These solar energy systems are included under solar
energy systems, leased and to be leased - net in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.

The cost of the solar energy systems under the lease pass-through fund 
arrangements as of December 31, 2016 was $785.3 million. The accumulated 
depreciation related to these assets as of December 31, 2016 was $2.1 million. 
The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of December 31, 2016 was 
$122.3 million, of which $51.5 million was classified as current liabilities.

Under lease pass-through fund arrangements, the investors make a large upfront 
payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in some cases, 
subsequent periodic payments. We allocate a portion of the aggregate payments 
received from the investors to the estimated fair value of the assigned ITCs, 
and the balance to the future customer lease payments that are also assigned to 
the investors. The estimated fair value of the ITCs are determined by 
discounting the estimated cash flows impact of the ITCs using an appropriate 
discount rate that reflects a market interest rate. We have an obligation to 
ensure the solar energy system is in service and operational for a term of five 
years to avoid any recapture of the ITCs. The amounts allocated to ITCs are 
initially recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and 
subsequently, one-fifth of the amounts allocated to ITCs is recognized as 
revenue from operating leases and solar energy systems incentives on our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations on each anniversary of the solar energy 
system’s placed in service date over the next five years.

We account for the residual of the payments received from the investors as a 
borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease pass-through financing 
obligation, which is repaid from customer payments and incentive rebates that 
are expected to be received by the investors. Under this approach, we continue 
to account for the arrangement with the customers in its consolidated financial 
statements, whether the cash generated from the customer arrangements is 
received by us or paid directly to the investors. A portion of the amounts 
received by the investors from customer payments and incentive rebates is 
applied to reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation, and the balance 
is allocated to interest expense. The incentive rebates and customer payments 
are recognized into revenue consistent with our revenue recognition accounting 
policy. Interest is calculated on the lease pass-through financing obligation 
using the effective interest rate method. The effective interest rate is the 
interest rate that equates the present value of the cash amounts to be received 
by an investor over the master lease term with the present value of the cash 
amounts paid by the investor to us, adjusted for any payments made by us. The 
lease pass-through financing obligation is non-recourse once the associated 
assets have been placed in service and all the customer arrangements have been 
assigned to the investors.

As of December 31, 2016, the future minimum lease payments to be received from 
the investors based on the solar energy systems currently under the lease 
pass-through fund arrangements, for each of the next five years and thereafter, 
were as follows (in thousands):

  2017             37,208  
  2018             37,653  
  2019             36,371  
  2020             35,622  
  2021             35,413  
  Thereafter      381,289  
  Total           563,556  

For two of the lease pass-through fund arrangements, our subsidiaries have 
pledged its assets to the investors as security for their obligations under the 
contractual agreements.

For each of the lease pass-through fund arrangements, we are required to comply 
with certain financial covenants specified in the contractual agreements, which 
we had met as of December 31, 2016.

Under the lease pass-through fund arrangements, we are responsible for any 
warranties, performance guarantees, accounting and performance reporting.

Under the lease pass-through fund arrangements, there is a one-time future lease
payment reset mechanism that is set to occur after all of the solar energy 
systems are delivered and placed in service in a fund. This reset date occurs 
when the installed capacity of the solar energy systems and placed in-service 
dates are known or on an agreed upon date. As part of this reset process, the 
lease prepayment is updated to reflect certain specified conditions as they 
exist at such date, including the final installed capacity, cost and in-service 
dates of the solar energy systems. As a result of this reset process, we may be 
obligated to refund a portion of an investor’s master lease prepayments or may 
be entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment from an investor. 
Any additional master lease prepayments by an investor would be recorded as an 
additional lease pass-through financing obligation, while any refunds of master 
lease prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.
