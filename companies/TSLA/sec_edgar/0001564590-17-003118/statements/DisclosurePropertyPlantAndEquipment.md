Construction in progress is comprised primarily of tooling and equipment related
to the manufacturing of our vehicles, a portion ofGigafactory 1 construction, 
and related capitalized interest. In addition, construction in progress also 
included certain build-to-suit lease arrangement for the Buffalo manufacturing 
facilities acquired through our SolarCity acquisition during the fourth quarter 
of 2016. Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset class and 
depreciation begins when the asset is ready for its intended use. Interest 
expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of significant 
capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in progress is 
included in property, plant and equipment, net, and is amortized over the life 
of the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2016 and 2015, we 
capitalized $46.7 million and $41.5 million of interest expense, respectively.

We are sometimes involved in construction at our leased facilities primarily 
related to retail stores, service centers, and certain manufacturing facilities.
In accordance with ASC 840, Leases, for build-to-suit lease arrangements where 
we are involved in the construction of structural improvements prior to the 
commencement of the lease or take some level of construction risk, we are 
considered the owner of the assets and land during the construction period. 
Accordingly, upon commencement of our construction activities, we record a 
construction in progress asset and a corresponding financing liability. Once the
construction is completed, if the lease meets certain “sale-leaseback” criteria,
we will remove the asset and related financial obligation from the balance sheet
and treat the building lease as an operating lease. If upon completion of 
construction, the project does not meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria, the 
leased property will be treated as a capital lease and included in building and 
building improvements in the table above.

In addition, as part of the SolarCity acquisition, we assumed a build-to-suit 
lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the State University of New 
York, or the Foundation, for the construction located in Buffalo, New York. See 
Note 17, Commitment and contingencies, for Build-to-Suit lease arrangement with 
the Foundation.

As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, the table above includes $1.32 
billion and $206.1 million of build-to-suit assets. As of December 31, 2016 and 
December 31, 2015, corresponding financing obligations of $3.8 million and $1.3 
million are recorded in accrued liabilities and $1.3 billion and $201.3 million 
are recorded in other long-term liabilities.

Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2016, 
2015 and 2014 were $477.3 million, $278.7 million and $155.9 million. Total 
property and equipment assets under capital lease as of December 31, 2016 and 
2015 were $112.6 million and $58.1 million. Accumulated depreciation related to 
assets under capital lease as of these dates were $40.2 million and $22.7 
million.

We have incurred $825.3 million and $317.5 million of costs for our Gigafactory 
1 as of December 31, 2016 and 2015.
