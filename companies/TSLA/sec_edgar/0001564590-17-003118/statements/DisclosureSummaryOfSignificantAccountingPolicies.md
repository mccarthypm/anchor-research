Basis of Presentation and Preparation

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles, or GAAP, and 
reflect the accounts and operations of Company and those of our subsidiaries in 
which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the 
provisions of Financial Accounting Standards Board, or FASB, Accounting 
Standards Codification, or ASC, 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any variable 
interest entity, or VIE, of which we are the primary beneficiary. SolarCity 
forms VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in 
order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes 
associated with solar energy systems. The typical condition for a controlling 
financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an
entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, 
such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting 
interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if 
that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb
losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right 
to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the 
VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest 
when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we 
are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs (see Note3, Acquisitions, and 
Note18, VIE Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an
ongoing basis to reassess if we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All 
intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current 
period presentation in our consolidated financial statements and the 
accompanying notes. Such reclassifications had no effect on previously reported 
results of operations or accumulated deficit. Starting in Q4, we have 
reclassified the revenue and cost of revenue of our energy storage products from
‘services and other’ into ‘energy generation and storage’ for all periods 
presented.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities and accompanying
notes. Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price
of products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and 
determining the amortization period of these elements, the collectability of 
accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, fair 
value of financial instruments, residual value of operating lease vehicles, 
depreciable lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems, the fair 
value and residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases, warranty 
liabilities, income taxes, contingencies, the accrued liability for solar energy
system performance guarantees, the determination of lease pass-through financing
obligations, the discount rates used to determine the fair value of investment 
tax credits, income taxes, the valuation of build-to-suit lease assets and the 
fair value of interest rate swaps, and inputs used to value stock-based 
compensation. In addition, estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting
for business combinations, including the fair value and useful lives of acquired
tangible and intangible assets, including solar energy systems, leased and to be
leased, the fair value of assumed debt, and the fair value of noncontrolling 
interests. Management bases its estimates on historical experience and on 
various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the results of which form 
the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and 
liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue for products and services when: (i) a persuasive evidence 
of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no 
uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) pricing or fees are fixed or 
determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.

Automotive Revenue

Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, 
sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, and specific 
other elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element 
accounting guidance including free access to our Supercharger network, free 
internet connectivity, and future free over-the-air software updates. These 
deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their revenue 
over our performance period, which is generally the eight-year life of the 
vehicle, except for internet connectivity which is over the free four year 
period. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine 
its fair value; otherwise, we use third party pricing of similar options, our 
best estimated selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver 
the service, and other information which may be available.

As of December 31, 2016, and 2015 we had deferred $291.2 million and $138.2 
million related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and service plans, access
to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, autopilot and over-the-air 
software updates.

At the time of revenue recognition, we record a reserve against revenue for 
estimated future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical 
experience and are immaterial in all periods presented.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting 
guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value 
guarantees. See “ Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs” and “ 
Direct Vehicle Leasing Program” for further details.

Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs

Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee

We offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers 
who purchase vehicles and who financed their vehicle through one of our 
specified commercial banking partners. Subsequent to June 30, 2016, this program
is available only in certain international markets. Under this program, 
customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the 
guarantee period for a determined resale value. Guarantee periods generally 
range from 36 to 39 months. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle 
sales price at the time of delivery, we are required to account for these 
transactions as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the 
resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. 
The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis
over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee 
period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off 
of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these vehicles on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciate 
their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the 
same period.

In cases when a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the 
guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining 
deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive 
leasing revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to 
costs of automotive leasing revenue. In cases when customers return the vehicle 
back to us during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the 
customer in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any 
remaining deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue and we reclassify the 
net book value of the vehicle on our balance sheet to pre-owned vehicle 
inventory. As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015,$179.5 million and 
$136.8 million of the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next 
twelve months.

Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee

We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to 
certain leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and 
as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions 
as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required underASC 840 - Leases.
Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is 
recorded within resale value guarantees for the long-term portion and deferred 
revenue for the current portion. We accrete the deferred revenue amount to 
automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period 
and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles 
under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on our Consolidated Balance
Sheets and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive 
leasing revenues during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. 
Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, 
is classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from 
financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either 
purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee 
amount, or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may 
realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred 
revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing 
revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle 
after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased 
vehicle to costs of automotive leasing revenue. The maximum cash we could be 
required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles 
is $855.9million at December 31, 2016.

As of December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had $1.18 billionand 
$527.5million of such borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and 
$289.1million and $120.5million recorded in deferred revenue liability, 
respectively. As ofDecember 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had a total of 
$57.0 million and $33.6 million in account receivables from our leasing 
partners.

On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under 
our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on 
any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values 
of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to
their estimated values.

Account activity related to our resale value guarantee and similar programs 
consisted of the following for the periods presented (in thousands):

Direct Vehicle Leasing Program

We offer a leasing program in the United States, Canada, the UK and Germany. 
Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla 
generally for 36 or 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the 
option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a determined 
residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases 
and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and record the 
depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenues. As of 
December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015, we had deferred $67.2 million and $25.8
million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease 
revenues are recorded in automotive leasing revenue and for the years ended 
December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, we recognized $112.7 million and $41.2 million
and $4.4 million.

Regulatory Credits

California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle 
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in 
that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. These laws and 
regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn 
regulatory credits (ZEV credits) and may sell excess credits to other 
manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory 
requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require 
compliance related to greenhouse gas emissions and also allow for the sale of 
excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a manufacturer 
solely of zero emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV 
and GHG credits on vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in 
the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third parties to purchase 
our regulatory credits.

We recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the
credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive revenue in our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Revenue from the sale of regulatory 
credits totaled $302.3 million, $168.7 million, and $216.3 million for the years
ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014.

Additionally, we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and 
Storey County in Nevada that will provide abatements for sales and use taxes, 
real and personal property taxes, and employer excise taxes, discounts to the 
base tariff energy rates, and transferable tax credits. These incentives are 
available for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on
June 30, 2034, subject to capital investments by Tesla and its partners for 
Gigafactory 1 of at least $3.5 billion in the aggregate on or before June 30, 
2024, and certain other conditions specified in the agreements. If we do not 
satisfy one or more conditions under the agreement, Tesla will be required to 
repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives 
incurred, plus interest. As of December 31, 2016, we have earned $45 million of 
transferable tax credits under these agreements. We record these credits as 
earned when we have evidence there is a market for their sale. Credits are 
applied as a cost offset to either employee expense or to capital assets, 
depending on the source of the credits. Credits earned from employee hires or 
capital spending by our partners at Gigafactory 1 are recorded as a reduction to
operating expenses.

Energy Generation and Storage Revenue

For solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full 
purchase price, either directly or through the Solar Loan program, revenue is 
recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system 
passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction, provided 
all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In instances where there 
are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement, we allocate the arrangement 
consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative 
selling price method. Costs incurred on residential installations before the 
solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as work in 
progress in our consolidated balance sheets. However, any fees that are paid or 
payable by us to a Solar Loan lender would be recognized as an offset against 
solar energy systems and components sales revenue, in accordance with ASC 
605-50, Customer Payments and Incentives.

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements for solar energy systems, we record lease revenue from minimum lease 
payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned from such systems, on 
a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, assuming all other 
revenue recognition criteria are met. For incentives that are earned based on 
the amount of electricity generated by the system, we record revenue as the 
amounts are earned. The difference between the payments received and the revenue
recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under 
power purchase agreements, we have determined that these agreements should be 
accounted for, in substance, as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is
recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under
the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized. Deferred revenue 
also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility 
companies and various local and state government agencies, which are recognized 
as revenue over the lease term, as well as the fees charged for remote 
monitoring service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective 
customer contract term. As of December 31, 2016, deferred revenue related to 
such customer payments amounted to $268.2 million. As of December 31, 2016, 
deferred revenue from rebates and incentives was not material.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system 
leases or power purchase agreements (the incremental cost of contract 
administration, referral fees and sales commissions) as an element of solar 
energy systems, leased and to be leased - net, and subsequently amortize these 
costs over the term of the related lease or power purchase agreement.

Service and Other Revenue

Services and other revenue consists of vehicle repair and maintenance services, 
vehicle service plans and merchandise, sales of pre-owned Tesla vehicles, sales 
of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, 
and sales of non-Tesla vehicle trade-ins.

Cost of Revenue

Automotive

Cost of automotive revenues includes direct parts, material and labor costs, 
manufacturing overhead, including amortized tooling costs, shipping and logistic
costs, vehicle internet connectivity costs, allocations of electricity and 
infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and reserves for 
estimated warranty expenses. Cost of revenues also includes adjustments to 
warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of our inventory 
when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide for on-hand 
inventory that is either obsolete or is in excess of forecasted demand.

Automotive Leasing

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of 
operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses 
recognized as incurred.

Energy Generation and Storage

Energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and direct 
material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other 
overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In 
addition, where the arrangement is accounted for as operating leases, the cost 
of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar 
energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems, and 
amortization of any initial direct costs.

Services and Other

Cost of services and other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor 
costs, manufacturing overhead associated with the sales of electric vehicle 
powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, costs associated with 
providing maintenance and development
services, and cost associated with sales of pre-owned vehicles.

Sales and other Use Taxes

Taxes assessed by various government entities, such as sales, use and 
value-added taxes, collected at the time of sale are excluded from Automotive 
net sales and revenue.

Transportation Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as 
automotive revenue, and related transportation costs are included in total cost 
of automotive revenues.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs

Marketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are 
included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in our 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. We incurred marketing, promotional and 
advertising costs of $48.0 million, $58.3 million and $48.9 million for the year
ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive Income (loss) is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive 
income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized gains 
and losses on derivatives, our available-for-sale marketable securities, and 
foreign currency translation adjustment that have been excluded from the 
determination of net loss.

Stock-based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and our employee stock 
purchase plan (the ESPP). The fair value of stock options and the ESPP are 
estimated on the grant date and offering date using an option pricing model, 
respectively. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the 
closing fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of
estimated forfeitures. Stock-based compensation associated with assumed awards 
as a result of the SolarCity acquisition is measured as of the acquisition date 
using the relevant assumptions and recognized on a straight-line basis over the 
remaining requisition service period, net of estimated forfeitures.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable.

For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of both performance and market conditions, the stock-based 
compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market 
conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance
and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant 
performance condition is considered probable of being met (see Note15 - Equity 
Incentive Plans).

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that SolarCity enters into to finance the costs of solar energy systems 
under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual provisions of 
the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We have further 
determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the noncontrolling 
interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the 
substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the 
Hypothetical Liquidation Book Value (HLBV) method. Under the HLBV method, the 
amounts reported as noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in our Consolidated Balance Sheets represent the amounts the 
third-parties would hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the 
liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were 
liquidated at their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and 
distributed to the third-parties. The third-parties’ interests in the results of
operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the noncontrolling 
interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in our Consolidated 
Balance Sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, after taking 
into account any capital transactions between the funds and the third-parties. 
However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the
redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented 
as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of our Consolidated Balance Sheets 
since these third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds 
for cash or other assets.

Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Our basic and diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable 
to common stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable 
to common stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock 
outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the 
number of shares underlying outstanding stock options and warrants as well as 
our Convertible Senior Notes, including the assumed awards and convertible notes
from the SolarCity acquisition, using the treasury stock method or the 
if-converted method, as applicable, are not included when their effect is 
antidilutive.

The following table presents the potential weighted common shares outstanding 
that were excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share 
of common stock attributable to common stockholders for the periods, related to 
the following securities:

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
cost of an acquisition is measured at the fair value of the assets given, equity
instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the acquisition date. Costs that 
are directly attributable to the acquisition are expensed as incurred. 
Identifiable assets, including intangible assets, liabilities assumed, including
contingent liabilities, in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date. Any noncontrolling interests in the acquired 
business are also initially measured at fair value. We recognize goodwill if the
aggregate fair value of the total purchase consideration and the noncontrolling 
interests is in excess of the aggregate fair value of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed. We recognize a bargain purchase gain in 
other income and expense, net, in our Consolidated Statement of Operations, if 
the aggregate fair value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities
assumed is in excess of the fair value of the total purchase consideration. We 
include the results of operations of the business that we acquire as of the 
respective date of acquisition.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. We currently 
invest our cash equivalents primarily in money market funds.

Restricted Cash and Deposits

We maintain certain cash amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. Current and
noncurrent restricted cash as of December 31, 2016, and 2015 was comprised 
primarily of cash as collateral related to our sales to lease partners with a 
resale value guarantee and for letters of credit including for our real estate 
leases, and insurance policies. In addition, restricted cash as of December 31, 
2016, includes cash received from certain fund investors that had not been 
released for use by us, cash held to service certain payments under various 
secured debt facilities, including management fees, principal and interest 
payments, and balances collateralizing outstanding letters of credit, 
outstanding credit card borrowing facilities and obligations under certain 
operating leases.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for DoubtfulAccounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain 
systems, sale of energy generation and storage products, receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, and from
maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an 
allowance against amounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be
collected. We write off accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible.

We typically do not carry accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related
sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery, except for the 
amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing 
arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions.

Customer Notes Receivable

As part of the SolarCity acquisition, we acquired certain customer notes 
receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. The outstanding balances, net 
of any allowance for potentially uncollectible amounts, are presented on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets as a component of prepaid expenses and other current
assets for the current portion and as MyPower customer notes receivable, net of 
current portion, for the long-term portion. In determining the allowance and 
credit quality for customer notes receivable, we identify significant customers 
with known disputes or collection issues and also consider our historical level 
of credit losses and current economic trends that might impact the level of 
future credit losses. Customer notes receivable that are individually impaired 
are charged-off as a write-off of allowance for losses. As of December 31, 2016,
there were no significant customers with known disputes or collection issues, 
and the amount of potentially uncollectible amounts was insignificant. 
Accordingly, we did not establish an allowance for losses against customer notes
receivable. In addition, there were no material non-accrual or past due customer
notes receivable as of December 31, 2016.

Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, 
customer notes receivable and interest rate swaps. Our cash equivalents are 
primarily invested in money market funds with high credit quality financial 
institutions in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may 
be in excess of insured limits.

As of December31, 2016, and2015, our accounts receivable were derived primarily 
from amounts to be received from financial institutions and leasing companies 
offering various financing products to our customers, sales of regulatory 
credits, as well asthe development and sales of powertrain components and 
systems toautomotive original equipment manufacturers(OEMs). In addition, our 
accounts receivable were also derived from the sale of our energy generation and
storage products, including any receivables from leasing solar energy systems as
well as power purchase agreements. The associated risk of concentration is 
mitigated by placing liens on the related solar energy systems. The associated 
risk of concentration for interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with 
several highly rated multinational banks. We maintain reserves for any amounts 
that we consider to be uncollectable.

At December 31, 2016, one customer represented approximately 10% of our total 
accounts receivable balance. At December 31, 2015, the same customer represented
approximately 15% of our total accounts receivable balance.

Supply Risk

The majority of our suppliers are currently single source suppliers, despite 
efforts to qualify and obtain components from multiple sources whenever 
feasible. The loss of any single or limited source supplier or the disruption in
the supply of components from these suppliers could lead to vehicle design 
changes, increased costs and delays in vehicle deliveries to our customers, 
which could hurt our relationships with our customers and result in negative 
publicity, damage to our brand and a material and adverse effect on our 
business, prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using 
standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which approximates 
actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for solar energy 
systems are recorded using actual cost. We record inventory write-downs for 
excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on current and 
future demand forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future 
demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off.

We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net
amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to 
determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to
convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A
small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported 
financial results.

Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles delivered under our resale value guarantee program, vehicles that are 
leased as part of our leasing programs as well as any vehicles that are sold 
with a significant buy-back guarantee are classified as operating lease vehicles
as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases. Operating 
lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation 
is computed using the straight-line method over the expected operating lease 
term. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2016 and 2015 was $3.53 billion and $2.00 
billion. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31, 
2016, and 2015 was $399.5 million and $216.5 million.

Solar Energy Systems, Leased and To Be Leased

We, through the acquisition of SolarCity, are the operating lessor of the solar 
energy systems under leases that qualify as operating leases. Our leases are 
accounted for in accordance with ASC 840, Leases. To determine lease 
classification, we evaluate lease terms to determine whether there is a transfer
of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, whether the 
lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life, or whether the present value 
of minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at lease inception. We 
utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful life and fair values at lease 
inception, and residual values at lease termination. Solar energy systems are 
stated at cost, less accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets as follows:

  Solar energy systems leased to customers            30 to 35 years         
  Initial direct costs related to customer solar      Lease term (20 years)  

Solar energy systems held for lease to customers are installed systems pending 
interconnection with the respective utility companies and will be depreciated as
solar energy systems leased to customers when the respective systems have been 
interconnected and placed in service. Solar energy systems under construction 
represents systems that are under installation, which will be depreciated as 
solar energy systems leased to customers when the respective systems are 
completed, interconnected and subsequently leased to customers. Initial direct 
costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition costs are 
capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer lease 
agreements.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recognized 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is 
generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful 
lives of the related assets as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture      2 to 12 years   
  Building and building improvements                       20 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software                          3 to 10 years   

Depreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method 
whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life
of the related assets. As of December 31, 2016, the estimated productive life 
for tooling was 250,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production.

Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
related accumulated depreciation are removed from our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in our Consolidated 
Statements of Operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as 
incurred, while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or 
expected life of the asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense 
over the identified useful life. Land is not depreciated.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in 
progress is included in property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized over
the life of the related assets.

Furthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the 
construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit lease 
arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to 
any potential cost overruns and our other commitments under the arrangements. In
these cases, we recognize a build-to-suit lease asset under construction and a 
corresponding build-to-suit lease liability on our Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review property and equipment, long-term prepayments and intangible assets, 
for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying
amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. We measure 
recoverability of these assets by comparing the carrying amounts to the future 
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property and 
equipment and intangible assets are considered to be impaired, the impairment to
be recognized equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets 
exceeds their fair value. We have made no material adjustments to our long-lived
assets in any of the years presented.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized over their estimated useful 
lives. We amortize our acquired intangible assets on a straight-line basis with 
definite lives over periods ranging from two to thirty years.

In-process research and development (IPR& D) is an intangible asset accounted as
an indefinite-lived asset until the completion or abandonment of the associated 
research and development effort. During the development period, we conduct an 
IPR& D impairment test annually and whenever events or changes in facts and 
circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the IPR& D is 
impaired. Events which might indicate impairment include, but are not limited 
to, adverse cost factors, deteriorating financial performance, strategic 
decisions made in response to economic, market, and competitive conditions, the 
impact of the economic environment on us and our customer base, and/or other 
relevant events such as changes in management, key personnel, litigations, or 
customers.

Capitalization of Software Costs

For costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs 
incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary 
project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. 
Internal-use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful life of three to ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets 
on an annual basis and tests for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the US dollar,
we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different rates 
we apply to accumulated deficits, including current period income or loss, and 
the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply daily functional currency rate 
to their income or loss and the month end functional currency rate to translate 
the balance sheet.

Beginning January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign 
subsidiaries changed to their local country’s currency. This change was based on
the culmination of facts and circumstances that have developed as we expanded 
our foreign operations over the past year. The adjustment of $10.0 million 
attributable to the current rate translation of non-monetary assets as of the 
date of the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income
(expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For the years 
ended December 31, 2016, 2015, and 2014 we recorded foreign currency transaction
gains (loss) of $26.1 million, ($45.6) million and $2.0 million.

Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and certified pre-owned 
vehicles, production powertrain components and systems, and energy products we 
sell. In addition, we also provide a warranty on the installation and components
of the solar energy systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 
years. We accrue a warranty reserve, which includes our best estimate of the 
projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates 
are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, 
frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain 
and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause 
material changes to our warranty reserve in the future. The portion of the 
warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as 
current within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining amount is 
classified as long-term within other long-term liabilities.

Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the periods presented 
(in thousands):

                                                                     Year Ended

Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with 
our vehicles subject to lease accounting and solar energy systems under lease 
contracts or power purchase agreements, as the costs to repair these warranty 
claims are expensed as incurred. The warranty reserve increased primarily due to
incremental vehicle deliveries, offset by actual claims and an overall decrease 
in accrual rates for vehicles, batteries, and drive units due to improved 
reliability. In addition, for the year ended December 31, 2016, we also assumed 
warranty liabilities of $31.4 million as a result of the SolarCity acquisition. 
For the year ended December 31, 2016 and December 31, 2015 warranty costs 
incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt 
arrangements were$19.0 million and$9.5 million. Warranty expense is recorded as 
a component cost of revenue.

Solar Energy Systems Performance Guarantees

SolarCity guarantees certain specified minimum solar energy production output 
for certain solar energy systems leased or sold to customers, generally for a 
term of up to 30 years. We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure that these
outputs are being achieved. We evaluate if any amounts are due to its customers 
and make any payments periodically as specified in the customer contracts. As of
December 31, 2016, we had recorded liabilities of $6.6 millionunder accrued 
liabilities and other in our Consolidated Balance Sheet, relating to these 
guarantees based on our assessment of the current exposure.

Solar Renewable Energy Credits

We account for solar renewable energy credits, or SRECs, when they are purchased
by us or sold to third parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy systems 
owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any 
specifically identifiable costs for those SRECs as there are no specific 
incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs. For SRECs purchased by us, we 
carry these SRECs at their cost, subject to impairment testing. We recognize 
revenue from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and 
the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded within cost of revenue.

Deferred ITCs Revenue

SolarCity has solar energy systems that are eligible for investment tax credits,
or ITCs, that accrue to eligible property under the IRC. Under Section 50(d)(5) 
of the IRC and the related regulations, a lessor of qualifying property may 
elect to treat the lessee as the owner of such property for the purposes of 
claiming the ITCs associated with such property. These regulations enable the 
ITCs to be separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer 
of the ITCs. Under the lease pass-through fund arrangements, SolarCity can make 
a tax election to pass-through the ITCs to the investor, who is the legal lessee
of the property. We are therefore able to monetize these ITCs to investors who 
can utilize them in return for cash payments. We consider the monetization of 
ITCs to constitute one of the key elements of realizing the value associated 
with solar energy systems. We therefore view the proceeds from the monetization 
of ITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy systems.

For lease pass-through fund arrangements, SolarCity allocates a portion of the 
aggregate payments received from the investors to the estimated fair value of 
the assigned ITCs and the balance to the future customer lease payments that are
also assigned to the investors. The estimated fair value of the ITCs is 
determined by discounting the estimated cash flows impacts of the ITCs using an 
appropriate discount rate that reflects a market interest rate.

We recognize the revenue associated with the monetization of ITCs in accordance 
with ASC 605-10-S99. The revenue associated with the monetization of the ITCs is
recognized when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) delivery 
has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is fixed or 
determinable and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
The ITCs are subject to recapture under the IRC if the underlying solar energy 
system either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in 
ownership within five years of its placed in service date. The recapture amount 
decreases on the anniversary of the placed in service date. As we have an 
obligation to ensure the solar energy system is in service and operational for a
term of five years to avoid any recapture of the ITCs, we recognize revenue as 
the recapture provisions lapse assuming the other aforementioned revenue 
recognition criteria have been met. The monetized ITCs are initially recorded as
deferred revenue on our Consolidated Balance Sheets, and subsequently, one-fifth
of the monetized ITCs is recognized as revenue from operating leases and solar 
energy systems incentives in our Consolidated Statements of Operations on each 
anniversary of the solar energy system’s “placed in service date” over the next 
five years.

SolarCity guarantees their financing fund investors that in the event of a 
subsequent recapture of ITCs by the taxing authority due to our noncompliance 
with the applicable ITC guidelines, we would compensate them for any recaptured 
ITCs. We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture event is remote and, 
consequently, have not recorded any liability in our Consolidated Balance Sheet 
for any potential recapture exposure.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) issued 
Accounting Standards Update (“ ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers (Topic 606), which amends the existing accounting standards for 
revenue recognition. The new guidance provides a new model to determine when and
over what period revenue is recognized. Under this new model, revenue is 
recognized as goods or services are delivered in an amount that reflects the 
consideration we expect to collect. In March 2016, the FASB issued an ASU, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Principal versus Agent Considerations 
(Reporting Revenue Gross versus Net), which clarifies the principal versus agent
guidance in the new revenue recognition standard. In April 2016, the FASB issued
another ASU, Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Identifying Performance 
Obligations and Licensing, which clarifies the guidance on accounting for 
licenses of intellectual property and identifying performance obligations in the
new revenue recognition standard. In May 2016, the FASB issued another ASU, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers: Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical 
Expedient, which clarifies the transition, collectability, noncash consideration
and the presentation of sales and other similar taxes in the new revenue 
recognition standard. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after
December 15, 2017; early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after 
December 15, 2016. The new standard is required to be applied retrospectively to
each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative 
effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. 
We have not yet selected a transition method and are evaluating the impact of 
adopting this guidance.

In August 2014, the FASB issued ASU No. 2014-15, Presentation of Financial 
Statements - Going Concern: Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s 
Ability to Continue as a Going Concern(“ ASU 2014-15”). ASU 2014-15 requires 
management to evaluate whether there is substantial doubt about the entity’s 
ability to continue as a going concern and, if so, provide certain footnote 
disclosures. ASU 2014-15 is effective for annual periods ending after December 
15, 2016, including interim reporting periods thereafter. We adopted ASU 2014-15
as of December 31, 2016, but it did not impact our consolidated financial 
statements.

In April 2015, the FASB issued an ASU on simplifying the presentation of debt 
issuance costs, which requires that debt issuance costs related to a recognized 
debt liability be presented in the balance sheet as a direct deduction from the 
carrying amount of that debt liability, consistent with debt discounts. We have 
retrospectively adopted the ASU as of March 31, 2016, and as a result, on our 
December 31, 2015 Consolidated Balance Sheet, we reclassified $9.6 million as a 
reduction in prepaid expenses and other current assets, along with $15.0 million
reduction in other assets, with a corresponding reduction in the aggregate 
carrying value of our long-term debt liabilities. Similarly, as a result of the 
change in carrying value of long term debt, $5.2 million was reclassified out of
additional paid in capital and into mezzanine equity on our December 31, 2015 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842). The ASU 
is effective for reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2018 and early 
adoption is permitted. The ASU will require lessees to report most leases as 
assets and liabilities on the balance sheet, while lessor accounting will remain
substantially unchanged. The ASU requires a modified retrospective transition 
approach for existing leases, whereby the new rules will be applied to the 
earliest year presented. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of 
adopting the ASU on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Compensation - Stock 
Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee Share-Based Payment 
Accounting(“ ASU 2016-09”). ASU 2016-09 simplifies several aspects of the 
accounting for share-based payment transactions, including the income tax 
consequences, classification of awards as either equity or liabilities, and 
classification on the statement of cash flows. ASU 2016-09 will become effective
for us beginning with the first quarter of 2017. Upon adoption of the ASU, we 
plan to account for forfeitures as incurred. The adoption of this guidance is 
not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.
See Note 16, Income taxes, for additional information regarding the impact of 
the adoption of this guidance.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Statement of Cash Flows: 
Classification of Certain Cash Receipts and Cash Payments (Topic 230). The ASU 
addresses the following eight specific cash flow issues: debt prepayment or debt
extinguishment costs; settlement of zero-coupon debt instruments or other debt 
instruments with coupon interest rates that are insignificant in relation to the
effective interest rate of the borrowing; contingent consideration payments made
after a business combination; proceeds from the settlement of insurance claims; 
proceeds from the settlement of corporate-owned life insurance policies 
(including bank-owned life insurance policies); distributions received from 
equity method investees; beneficial interests in securitization transactions; 
and separately identifiable cash flows and application of the predominance 
principle. The ASU is effective for fiscal years, and interim periods within 
those fiscal years, beginning after December 15, 2017, with early adoption 
permitted. We are currently evaluating the potential impact of adopting the ASU 
on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: 
Restricted Cash (Topic 230). The ASU requires that a statement of cash flows 
explain the change during the period in the total of cash, cash equivalents, and
amounts generally described as restricted cash or restricted cash equivalents. 
Therefore, amounts generally described as restricted cash and restricted cash 
equivalents should be included with cash and cash equivalents when reconciling 
the beginning-of-period and end-of-period total amounts shown on the statement
