As of December 31, 2016, we recorded a valuation allowance of $1.02 billion for 
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $354.3 million during
the year ended December 31, 2016. The valuation allowance increase is primarily 
due to additional U. S. deferred tax assets incurred in the current year that 
cannot be realized, inclusive of $169.3 million increase relating to the 
SolarCity acquisition, and offset by immaterial valuation allowance releases in 
foreign jurisdictions. Management believes that based on the available 
information, it is more likely than not that the U. S. deferred tax assets will 
not be realized, such that a full valuation allowance is required against all U.
S. deferred tax assets. We have net $33.1 million of deferred tax assets in 
foreign jurisdictions which we believe are more-likely-than-not to be fully 
realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2016, we had approximately $4.34 billion of federal and $3.01
billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future 
taxable income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for 
federal and 2017 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by
SolarCity prior to our acquisition and therefore are subject to change of 
control provisions which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be
utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control 
limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes. The
portion of net operating loss carryforwards related to stock options is 
approximately $2.39 billion and $1.42 billion for federal and state purposes, 
respectively, of which the tax benefits will be credited to additional paid-in 
capital when realized. Upon the adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, all tax effects 
related to share-based payments will be recognized through earnings, subject to 
normal valuation allowance considerations. We expect that any potential tax 
benefits, upon adoption of ASU No. 2016-09, would increase our deferred tax 
asset which would be offset with a full valuation allowance.

We have research and development tax credits of approximately $153.0 million and
$163.6 million for federal and state income tax purposes, respectively. If not 
utilized, the federal research and development tax credits will expire in 
various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state research and development 
tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we have other 
general business tax credits of approximately $105.5 million for federal income 
tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.

The Company has an immaterial amount of undistributed foreign earnings as of 
December 31, 2016. In addition, we have not recognized a deferred tax liability 
for the remittance of any undistributed foreign earnings to the United States as
such earnings are intended to be indefinitely reinvested in operations outside 
the United States.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We determined 
that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net 
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to any prior ownership changes.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits 
during the years ended December 31, 2016, 2015 and 2014 were as follows (in 
thousands):

  Increases in balances related to current year tax positions       62,805

Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are 
classified as income tax expense and was immaterial. As of December 31, 2016, 
unrecognized tax benefits of $198.3 million, if recognized, would not affect our
effective tax rate as the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which
is currently fully offset with a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate 
that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly 
increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We file income tax returns in 
the United States, California, various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax 
years 2003 to 2015 remain subject to examination for federal purposes, and tax 
years 2003 to 2015 remain subject to examination for California purposes. All 
net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment
for U. S. federal and California purposes. Tax years 2007 to 2015 remain open 
for examination in other U. S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

The United States Tax Court has issued a decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner
related to the treatment of share-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing 
arrangement. As this decision, can be overturned upon appeal, we have not 
recorded any impact as of December 31, 2016. In addition, any potential tax 
benefits would increase our deferred tax asset which would be offset with a full
valuation allowance.
