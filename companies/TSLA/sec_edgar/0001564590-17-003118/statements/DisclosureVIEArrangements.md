SolarCity enters into various arrangements with investors to facilitate funding 
and monetization ofsolar energy systems. These arrangements include those 
described in this Note, as well as those described in Note 19, Lease 
Pass-Through Financing Obligation.

Fund Arrangements

SolarCity has a number of financing funds that were formed by wholly owned 
subsidiaries of SolarCity and fund investors. These arrangements were created to
facilitate funding and monetization of solar energy systems. The following table
shows the number of funds by investor classification, carrying value of the 
solar energy systems in the funds, total investor contributions received and 
undrawn investor contributions as of December 31, 2016 (in thousands, except for
number of funds, and unaudited) for funds that have been determined to be VIEs:

We have determined that the funds are VIEs and we are the primary beneficiary of
these VIEs by reference to the power and benefits criterion under ASC 810, 
Consolidation. We have considered the provisions within the contractual 
agreements, which grant it power to manage and make decisions that affect the 
operation of these VIEs, including determining the solar energy systems and 
associated customer contracts to be sold or contributed to these VIEs and the 
redeployment of solar energy systems and management of customer receivables. We 
consider that the rights granted to the fund investors under the contractual 
agreements are more protective in nature rather than participating.

As the primary beneficiary of these VIEs, we consolidate in our financial 
statements the financial position, results of operations and cash flows of these
VIEs, and all intercompany balances and transactions between us and these VIEs 
are eliminated in the consolidated financial statements. Cash distributions of 
income and other receipts by a fund, net of agreed upon expenses, estimated 
expenses, tax benefits and detriments of income and loss and tax credits, are 
allocated to the fund investor and our subsidiary as specified in contractual 
agreements.

Generally, our subsidiary has the option to acquire the fund investor’s interest
in the fund for an amount based on the market value of the fund or the formula 
specified in the contractual agreements.

As of December 31, 2016, we were contractually required to make payments to a 
fund investor in order to ensure the investor is projected to achieve a 
specified minimum return annually. The amounts of any potential future payments 
under this guarantee are dependent on the amounts and timing of future 
Distributions to the investor from the fund, the tax benefits that accrue to the
investor from the fund’s activities and the amount and timing of our purchase of
the investor’s interest in the fund or the amount and timing of the 
distributions to the investor upon liquidation of the fund. Due to uncertainties
associated with estimating the amount and timing of distributions to the 
investor and the possibility and timing of the liquidation of the fund, we are 
unable to determine the potential maximum future payments that it would have to 
make under this guarantee.

Upon the sale or liquidation of a fund, distributions would occur in the order 
and priority specified in the contractual agreements.

Pursuant to management services, maintenance and warranty arrangements, we have 
been contracted to provide services to the funds, such as operations and 
maintenance support, accounting, lease servicing and performance reporting. In 
some instances, we have guaranteed payments to the investors as specified in the
contractual agreements. A fund’s creditors have no recourse to our general 
credit or to that of other funds. None of the assets of the funds had been 
pledged as collateral for their obligations.

We present the solar energy systems in the VIEs under solar energy systems, 
leased and to be leased - net in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. The aggregate 
carrying values of the VIEs’ assets and liabilities, after elimination of 
intercompany transactions and balances, in our Consolidated Balance Sheets were 
as follows (in thousands):

We are contractually obligated to make certain fund investors whole if they 
suffer certain losses resulting from the disallowance or recapture of ITCs or U.
S. Treasury grants. We account for distributions due to the fund investors 
arising from a reduction of anticipated ITCs or U. S. Treasury grants received 
under distributions payable to noncontrolling interests and redeemable 
noncontrolling interests in our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 
2016, we had accrued $0.3 million for this obligation.
