| **  Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments

ASC 820 states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based 
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market 
participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair
value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in 
active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets 
that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable 
inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy 
requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair 
value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value 
hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our U.
S. government securities, certificates of deposit, time deposits and corporate 
debt securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and 
the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. Our 
interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy 
because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that 
utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates.

Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as 
ofDecember 31, 2022 and 2021 consisted of the following (in millions):

We record gross realized gains, losses and credit losses as a component of Other
(expense) income, net in the consolidated statements of operations. For the 
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we did not recognize any material gross 
realized gains, losses or credit losses. The ending allowance balances for 
credit losses were immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021. We 
have determined that the gross unrealized losses on our investments as of 
December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021 were temporary in nature.

The following table summarizes the fair value of our investments by stated 
contractual maturities as ofDecember 31, 2022 (in millions):

  Due in 1 year or less                5,135  
  Due in 1 year through 5 years          636

Disclosure of Fair Values

Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include 
accounts receivable, financing receivables, accounts payable, accrued 
liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these financial 
instruments approximate their fair values, other than our2.375% Convertible 
Senior Notes due in2022(“2022 Notes”) and2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due 
in2024(“2024 Notes”) (collectively referred to as “Convertible Senior Notes” 
below).

We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes using commonly 
accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk measurements that are 
indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). The following table 
presents the estimated fair values and the carrying values (in millions):
