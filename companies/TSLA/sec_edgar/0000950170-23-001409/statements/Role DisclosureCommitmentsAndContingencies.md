Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY 
Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related 
research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop the 
facility.

Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment 
targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New 
York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined 
capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State 
of New York during the10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual 
basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such 
date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation 
requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million “program payment” 
to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. 
Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, 
then additional amounts may become payable by us.

In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or 
incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods 
sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. On 
February 1, 2022, we reported to the State of New York that we had met and 
exceeded our annual requirements for jobs and investment in Buffalo and New York
State. As of December 31, 2022, we are currently in excess of such targets 
relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and Buffalo and 
do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable obligations in the 
years beyond. However, if our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our 
investment and operations at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof 
prove incorrect, we may incur additional expenses or be required to make 
substantial payments to the SUNY Foundation.

Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China

We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of50 years with the 
local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing
Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to 
spend RMB14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023 and to 
generate RMB2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If 
we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project 
approvals, in accordance with the Chinese government’s standard terms for such 
arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government 
and receive compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings 
and fixtures. We expect to meet the capital expenditure and tax revenue 
requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.

Legal Proceedings

Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the 
Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our 
acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as 
defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and 
alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties 
in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims
and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, 
unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 22, 2020, 
all of the director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve 
the lawsuit against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable 
insurance policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any 
wrongdoing by any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla 
received payment of approximately $43 million on September 16, 2020, which has 
been recognized in our consolidated statements of operations as a reduction to 
Selling, general and administrative operating expenses for costs previously 
incurred related to the acquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court
issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion for summary 
judgment and granted in part and denied in part defendants’ previously-filed 
motion for summary judgment. The case was set for trial in March 2020 until it 
was postponed by the Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The 
trial was held from July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 
22, 2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that (a) the class 
is decertified and the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action 
under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1 and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk 
are dismissed with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument
was held on January 18, 2022.

On April 27, 2022, the Court entered judgment in favor of Mr. Musk on all 
counts. On May 26, 2022, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. The parties 
have completed briefing and argument will be held before the Supreme Court of 
Delaware on March 29, 2023.

These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U. S. District Court 
for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for
violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by 
Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed 
pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.

Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award

On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and 
derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the 
members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate 
waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary 
duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 
2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission 
or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its 
opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on 
December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019.
On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the 
corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty 
and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants’ answer was filed on December 3, 2019.

On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a 
class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff 
filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On 
October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary 
judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed 
to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. 
Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 
2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that, among other 
things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint 
are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall 
continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; 
and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with 
prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial 
summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff’s summary judgment motion and (c) 
opposed the plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint. In January 2022, the case
was assigned to a different judge. On February 24, 2022, the court (i) granted 
plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint, and (ii) canceled oral argument on 
the summary judgment motions, stating that the court is “skeptical that this 
litigation can be resolved based on the undisputed facts” and the “case is going
to trial,” but that the “parties may reassert their arguments made in support of
summary judgment in their pre-trial and post-trial briefs.” Trial was held 
November 14-18, 2022. Post-trial briefing is underway and post-trial argument is
scheduled for February 21, 2023.

Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation

On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of 
Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to 
Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts
claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory 
and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed 
their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is currently set for November 27, 
2023, to December 1, 2023.

Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction

Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class 
actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s 
August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of
the suits are now pending in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District 
of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each 
purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to 
Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief 
on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs 
filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants 
the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The now-consolidated purported 
stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel
was briefed and argued before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled 
regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on 
November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April
15, 2020, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated
to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November
25, 2020. On January 11, 2022, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary 
judgment. On April 1, 2022, the Court granted in part plaintiffs’ motion for 
partial summary judgment. The Company disagrees with the ruling and accordingly,
on April 22, 2022, asked the Court for reconsideration or, in the alternative, 
certification to file an interlocutory appeal. On June 16, 2022, in response to 
Tesla’s motions, the Court denied certification to appeal and declined to 
reconsider its opinion but clarified its summary judgment ruling to make clear 
that it had not ruled that any misstatements it identified met the required 
materiality element under the securities statute. The issue of materiality and 
reliance will both be questions for the jury to decide at trial, which started 
on January 17, 2023.

Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed
in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. 
Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant 
times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going
private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter
posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, 
and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the 
above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to
these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February
11, 2019 in the U. S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly 
on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of 
directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and 
stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported 
stockholder class action.

On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a 
purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members 
breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the 
Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the 
plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal 
procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The parties reached an 
agreement to stay the case until March 7, 2023.

Unless otherwise stated, the individual defendants named in the stockholder 
proceedings described above and the Company with respect to the stockholder 
class action proceedings described above believe that the claims in such 
proceedings have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are 
unable to reasonably estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, 
associated with these claims.

On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against 
Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant 
agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014.
In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based 
upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla
private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a violation of the parties’ 
agreement. In 2021, Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which
they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $162 
million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been 
delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 
24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the 
underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have 
terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to
the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially 
unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were 
neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant 
agreements. JP Morgan filed a motion for judgment on the pleadings, which Tesla 
opposed, and that motion is currently pending before the Court.

Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment

On October 4, 2021, in a case captionedDiaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern 
District of California returned a verdict of $136.9 million against Tesla on 
claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race 
discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla’s Fremont Factory from 2015-2016.
On November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a
request for a new trial or reduction of the jury’s damages. The Court held a 
hearing on Tesla’s motion on January 19, 2022. On April 13, 2022, the Court 
granted Tesla’s motion in part, reducing the total damages to $15 million and 
conditionally denied the motion for a new trial subject to the plaintiff’s 
acceptance of the reduced award. On June 21, 2022, the plaintiff rejected the 
reduced award and, as a result, on June 27, 2022, the Court ordered a new trial 
on damages only, to commence on March 27, 2023. Tesla continues to believe that 
the facts and law do not justify the damages awarded and is assessing its next 
steps.

On February 9, 2022, shortly after theDiaz jury verdict, the California Civil 
Rights Department (”CRD,” formerly “DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla
in Alameda County, California Superior Court, alleging systemic race 
discrimination, hostile work environment and pay equity claims, among others. 
CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary damages and injunctive relief. On 
September 22, 2022, Tesla filed a cross complaint against CRD, alleging that it 
violated the Administrative Procedures Act by failing to follow statutory 
pre-requisites prior to filing suit and that cross complaint was subject to a 
sustained demurrer. Tesla has until February 3, 2023 to amend its cross 
complaint. The case is now in discovery.

Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD’s 
allegations. Tesla is in the process of setting up a mandatory mediation with 
the EEOC.

On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in 
the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on 
behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both 
suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and 
violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and 
gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek
declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and 
attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on 
September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 
2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case. Plaintiffs filed a 
response of January 13, 2023, and the defendants’ reply is due February 17, 
2023.

Certain Investigations and Other Matters

We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental 
authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”)
and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate 
with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and 
informal requests and other investigations and inquiries.

For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon 
Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The 
take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered 
into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an
amendment. The SEC also has periodically issued subpoenas to us seeking 
information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC 
settlement, as amended.

Separately, the company has received requests from the DOJ for documents related
to Tesla’s Autopilot and FSD features. To our knowledge no government agency in 
any ongoing investigation has concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot 
predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government 
decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a 
material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash 
flows and financial position.

We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise 
from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or 
development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse 
impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial 
position and brand.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2022, we had $318 million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
