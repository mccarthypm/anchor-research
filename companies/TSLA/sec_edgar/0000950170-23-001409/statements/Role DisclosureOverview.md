COVID-19 pandemic, as well as an easing of restrictions on social, business, 
travel and government activities and functions. There are ongoing global impacts
resulting from the pandemic, and we have been affected by temporary 
manufacturing closures, employment and compensation adjustments and impediments 
to administrative activities supporting our product deliveries and deployments. 
In addition, we have experienced and are experiencing the impacts of varying 
levels of inflation caused by the COVID‐19 pandemic and general global economic 
conditions.

by4,000,000,000 shares and our Board of Directors declared the 2022 Stock Split.

additional shares of common stock for each then-held share, distributed after
