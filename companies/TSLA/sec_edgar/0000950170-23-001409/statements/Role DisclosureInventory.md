Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer 
orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles and energy products 
available for sale.

For solar energy systems, we commence transferring component parts from 
inventory to construction in progress, a component of solar energy systems, once
a lease or PPA contract with a customer has been executed and installation has 
been initiated. Additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, 
including labor and overhead, are recorded within solar energy systems under 
construction.

We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we 
believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying 
value. During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 we recorded 
write-downs of$144 million,$106 million and $145 million, respectively, in Cost 
of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
