(1)

Accrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services for which we
had not yet been invoiced. As we are invoiced for these goods and services, this
balance will reduce and accounts payable will increase. For the year ended 
December 31, 2022, accrued purchases increased as we continued construction and 
expansion of our facilities and operations.

(2)

Taxes payable includes value added tax, sales tax, property tax, use tax and 
income tax payables.
