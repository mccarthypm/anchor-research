Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of 
likelihood that customers would exercise their resale value guarantees, 
resulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with 
resale value guarantees. Actual return rates being lower than expected and 
increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of 
our reserve of $

365

million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented increases in 
automotive sales revenue. The net release or increase of reserves which impacted
automotive sales revenue were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 
and December 31, 2020. Further, $

324

million of the total revenue recognized as of December 31, 2022 is related to 
the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Under the modified retrospective method of adoption of ASU 2020-06, the dilutive
impact of convertible senior notes was calculated using the if-converted method 
for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. Certain convertible senior notes
were calculated using the treasury stock method for the year ended December 31, 
2020.

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other (expense) income, net, in the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.
