There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes 
with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, 
except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to 
our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased 
vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other assets and as may be
described below.

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our 
subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net 
carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. As of 
December 31, 2022, we were in material compliance with all financial debt 
covenants.

2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

During the first quarter of 2022, the remaining $29 million in aggregate 
principal amount of the 2022 Notes was converted and settled in cash for their 
par amount, and1.2 million shares of our common stock were issued for the 
applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock 
Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 
2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 
2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of1.2 million shares of our common stock 
during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. 
Additionally, during the year ended December 31, 2022, we fully settled the 
warrants entered into in connection with the issuance of the 2022 Notes, 
resulting in the issuance of37.0 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted
to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split.

2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 
Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting 
transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.

As adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split, each $1,000 of principal of 
the 2024 Notes is now convertible into48.4140 shares of our common stock, which 
is equivalent to a conversion price of approximately $20.66 per share, subject 
to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2024 Notes
may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further, holders of
the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 2024 only 
under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter commencing 
after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if the last 
reported sale price of our common stock for at least20 trading days (whether or 
not consecutive) during a period of30 consecutive trading days ending on the 
last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is greater than or 
equal to130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) during the 
five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day period in which 
the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading
day of such period is less than98% of the product of the last reported sale 
price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such trading day, or 
(3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be
settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our 
election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of 
the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes
for cash at a repurchase price equal to100% of the principal amount plus any 
accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur 
prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder 
who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain
circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to settle in the 
following quarter are classified as current in our consolidated balance sheets.

In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase89.1 million shares
of our common stock at a price of approximately $20.66 per share, as adjusted to
give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The cost of the convertible note hedge 
transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders
of the warrants had the option to purchase89.1 million shares of our common 
stock at a price of approximately $40.50 per share, as adjusted to give effect 
to the 2022 Stock Split. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from the sale
of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note hedges 
and the sale of the warrants were intended to effectively increase the overall 
conversion price from approximately $20.66 to approximately $40.50 per share. As
these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges
and warrants were recorded in stockholders’ equity and were not accounted for as
derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge
and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in 
capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

The closing price of our common stock exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion
price on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of each quarter in 
2022, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the 
subsequent quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2022, $54 million in 
aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was converted and settled in cash 
for their par amount, and2.4 million shares of our common stock were issued for 
the applicable conversion premium, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock 
Split. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 
2024 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 
2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of2.4 million shares of our common stock 
during the same period, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As 
of December 31, 2022, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the 
outstanding principal amount by $186 million.

Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement 
(as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of 
banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a)1% 
plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus0.50%, (ii) the 
lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts 
is0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts 
receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is 
based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.

In January 2023, we entered into a5-year senior unsecured revolving credit 
facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to replace the 
existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement 
contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to 
$5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain 
circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate 
purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for 
dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking 
secured overnight financing rate) plus0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; (ii)
for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight index 
average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an adjusted 
EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable margin. 
The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our senior, 
unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to time. The 
fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is 
currently0.15% per annum.

Automotive Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to 
certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue 
Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. 
The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated 
by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest 
payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, 
and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize 
revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with 
our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not 
available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the 
Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.

Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes

Our subsidiaries pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems and the 
associated customer contracts, our interests in certain financing funds or 
certain MyPower customer notes receivable into SPEs and issued Solar Asset and 
Loan-backed Notes backed by these solar assets, interests to investors or 
MyPower customer notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are 
consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these 
solar assets and notes receivable, or distributed by the underlying financing 
funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on
the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any 
remaining cash is distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not 
available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the 
Solar Asset and Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. 
We contracted with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and 
administrative services for the solar energy systems. As of December 31, 2022, 
solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes had a 
carrying value of $69 million and are included within Solar energy systems, net,
on the consolidated balance sheet.

During the year ended December 31, 2022, we early repaid $819 million in 
aggregate principal of the Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes and recorded an 
extinguishment of debt charge of $24 million related to the early repayments in 
Interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations.

Cash Equity Debt

In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our 
subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that 
bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our 
interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities

Our subsidiaries have entered into various credit agreements for borrowings 
secured by our interests in certain vehicle leases. These facilities are 
non-recourse to our other assets.

Pledged Assets

As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had pledged or restricted $2.02 billion and
$5.25 billion of our assets (consisting principally of restricted cash, 
receivables, inventory, solar energy systems, operating lease vehicles, property
and equipment and equity interests in certain SPEs) as collateral for our 
outstanding debt.
