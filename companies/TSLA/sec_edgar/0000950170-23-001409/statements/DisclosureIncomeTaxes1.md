As of December 31, 2022, we recorded a valuation allowance of $7.35 billion for 
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes decreased by $1.73 billion in the 
year ended December 31, 2022, and increased by $6.14 billion and $974 million 
during the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The changes in 
valuation allowance are primarily due to changes in U. S. deferred tax assets 
and liabilities incurred in the respective year. The decrease in the year ended 
December 31, 2022 included utilization of $13.57 billion net operating loss 
carry forwards to offset our 2022 U. S. taxable income. We have $532 million of 
deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are 
more-likely-than-not to be realized given the expectation of future earnings in 
these jurisdictions. We did not have any material releases of valuation 
allowance for the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020. We continue to 
monitor the realizability of the U. S. deferred tax assets taking into account 
multiple factors. In completing this assessment, we considered both objective 
and subjective factors. These factors included, but were not limited to, a 
history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits related to stock-based 
compensation, future reversal of existing temporary differences and tax planning
strategies. After evaluating all available evidence, we intend to continue 
maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U. S. deferred tax assets until 
there is sufficient evidence to support the reversal of all or some portion of 
these allowances. Given the improvement in our operating results and depending 
on the amount of stock-based compensation tax deductions available in the 
future, we may release the valuation allowance associated with the U. S. 
deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of all, or a portion, of the 
valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain deferred tax 
assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the release is 
recorded.

As of December 31, 2022, we had $18.0 billion of federal and $14.0 billion of 
state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable 
income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2023 for federal
and state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by our acquisition 
of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”) and some of the other companies we 
acquired, and therefore are subject to change of control provisions, which limit
the amount of acquired tax attributes that can be utilized in a given tax year. 
We do not expect the change of control limitations or expiration dates to 
significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.

As of December 31, 2022, we had research and development tax credits of $969 
million and $734 million for federal and state income tax purposes, 
respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits 
will expire in various amounts beginning in2024. However, the state of 
California research and development tax credits can be carried forward 
indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $197 
million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly 
expire until2033.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have 
determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of 
our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership 
changes.

The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate 
of15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the25% statutory corporate 
income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this 
beneficial income tax rate of15% for 2019 through 2023.

As of December 31, 2022, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings
and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs. We have 
recorded the taxes associated with the earnings we intend to repatriate in the 
future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred tax 
liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The 
estimated amount of such unrecognized deferred tax liability associated with the
indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $168 million.

As of December 31, 2022, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and amounted to $31 million. 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $572 million, if recognized, would not affect our 
effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset 
that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance.

We file income tax returns in the U. S. and various state and foreign 
jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue 
Service (“IRS”) for the years2015 to2018. Additional tax years within the 
periods2004 to2014 and2019 to2021 remain subject to examination for federal 
income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date 
are subject to adjustment for U. S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our 
returns for2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U. S. 
state and foreign jurisdictions.

Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate
of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax 
benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.
