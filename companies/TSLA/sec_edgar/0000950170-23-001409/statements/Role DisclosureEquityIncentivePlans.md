| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 13 - Equity Incentive Plans

In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 
2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock
appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, 
directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be 
either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock 
options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be 
granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock 
options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over
a maximum period of10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates
when the employment or consulting relationship ends.

As of December 31, 2022,148.0 million shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2019 Plan, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock 
Split.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year 
ended December 31, 2022:

Tranche 12 of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which represents

25.3

million stock options, was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 and will vest 
upon expected certification following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 
10-K.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended 
December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $239.85, $261.33 and $100.17, respectively,
as adjusted to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. The aggregate release date 
fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020 was $4.32
billion, $5.70 billion and $3.25 billion, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 
31, 2022, 2021, and 2020 was $1.90 billion, $26.88 billion and $1.55 billion, 
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO exercised all of 
the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, which amounted
to an intrinsic value of $23.45 billion.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, under the ESPP we 
issued1.4 million,1.5 million and5.5 million shares, respectively, as adjusted 
to give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. As of December 31, 2022, there were99.9 
million shares available for issuance under the ESPP, as adjusted to give effect
to the 2022 Stock Split.

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the 
grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The 
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options 
are as follows:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is 
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common 
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield for 
zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s 
expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our
employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied 
volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical 
volatility of our common stock.

2018 CEO Performance Award

In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of304.0 
million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split 
and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 
2018 CEO Performance Award consists of12 vesting tranches with a vesting 
schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones 
(performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment 
either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and 
service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 
CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors 
that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which began 
at $ 100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $ 50.0 
billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30
calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, 
and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total 
revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted 
EBITDA have been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an 
annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial 
statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as 
net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, 
provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and 
stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of 
the exercise price of $23.34 per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 
Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires 
for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are 
simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax 
withholding.

The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2022 is 
provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last
quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the 
financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 
10-Q and/or 10-K.

Achieved in the fourth quarter of 2022 and expected to be certified following 
the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Stock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a 
non-cash expense and is recorded as a Selling, general, and administrative 
operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter 
since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we have recognized expense, 
generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the 
maximum of12 tranches) that corresponds to the number of operational milestones 
that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in 
the future, in accordance with the following principles.

On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each 
tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time 
when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be 
achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.” 
Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial 
performance, each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will 
achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or 
deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to 
achieve that operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone 
achievement time.”

During the first quarter of 2022, three operational milestones were achieved and
consequently, we recognized an aggregate catch-up expense of $11 million.

As of December 31, 2022, all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation 
expense under the 2018 CEO Performance Award has been recognized. For the years 
ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded stock-based compensation 
expense of $66 million, $910 million and $838 million, respectively, related to 
the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

Other Performance-Based Grants

2021 Performance-Based Stock Option & RSU Awards

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of 
Directors granted to certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options 
to purchase an aggregate2.2 million shares of our common stock, as adjusted to 
give effect to the 2022 Stock Split. We begin recording stock-based compensation
expense when the performance milestones become probable of achievement. 
Following achievement, vesting occurs over a two-year period with continued 
employment. As ofDecember 31, 2022, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation
expense of$204 million, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period 
of3.2 years. For the year ended December 31, 2022, we recorded$159 million of 
stock-based compensation expense related to this grant, net of forfeitures.

expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a 
weighted-average period of2.26 years.
