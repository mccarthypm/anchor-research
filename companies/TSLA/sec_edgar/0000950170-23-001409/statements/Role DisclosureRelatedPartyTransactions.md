In February 2020, our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors purchased from 
us195,555 and18,750 shares, respectively, as adjusted to give effect to the 2022
Stock Split, of our common stock in a public offering at the public offering 
price for an aggregate $10 million and $1 million, respectively.

In June 2020, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us for an 
interim term of90 days. During the interim term, we resumed our annual 
evaluation of all available options for providing directors’ and officers’ 
indemnity coverage, which we had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place
requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, we 
obtained a binding market quote for a directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $100 million.

Pursuant to the indemnification agreement, our CEO provided, from his personal 
funds, directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage to us during the interim term
in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us, up to a total of $100 
million. In return, we paid our CEO a total of $3 million, which represents the 
market-based premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 
days and further discounted by50%. Following the lapse of the 90-day period, we 
did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and 
instead bound a customary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy 
with third-party carriers.

In relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from
the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. 
However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an 
indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for additional taxes owed, if
any.

Tesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and 
directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and Twitter, Inc., in accordance with 
our Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, 
and are not currently expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements.
