| **  Principles of Consolidation** | Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our 
subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance 
with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation(“ASC 810”), we consolidate any 
variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We 
have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of 
business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain 
attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct 
vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial 
interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; 
however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as 
VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC
810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has 
the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that 
could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not 
consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not
considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary 
beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity 
Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing 
basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

|   Use of Estimates | Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the
accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining 
significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales 
return reserves, the collectability of accounts and finance receivables, 
inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, goodwill, fair
value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of operating lease
vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be impacted. We have 
assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events or circumstances 
that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or materially affected 
the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the date of issuance of 
this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change as new events occur 
and additional information is obtained. Actual results could differ materially 
from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions.

(1)

Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of 
likelihood that customers would exercise their resale value guarantees, 
resulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with 
resale value guarantees. Actual return rates being lower than expected and 
increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of 
our reserve of $

365

million for the year ended December 31, 2021, which represented increases in 
automotive sales revenue. The net release or increase of reserves which impacted
automotive sales revenue were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2022 
and December 31, 2020. Further, $

324

million of the total revenue recognized as of December 31, 2022 is related to 
the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 2022.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing 
deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet 
the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to 
our FSD features, internet connectivity, Supercharger network and over-the-air 
software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the 
customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are 
typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance with payment 
terms customary to the business, except sales we finance for which payments are 
collected over the contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return 
reserve based on historical experience plus consideration for expected future 
market values, when we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. 
Other features and services such as access to our internet connectivity, legacy 
programs offering unlimited free Supercharging and over-the-air software updates
are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a
straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services
to the customer. Other limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized 
based on actual usage or expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue 
related to these other features and services over the performance period, which 
is generally the expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD 
is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and the portion 
related to software updates is recognized over time. For our obligations related
to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs 
used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options 
and other information that may be available.

Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange 
the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. 
Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales 
personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive 
sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract 
are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and 
handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to 
recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or
accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive
sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the
transaction price of automotive contracts.

We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain 
international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles 
through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Under these programs, 
we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery and 
our counterparty has the option of selling their vehicle back to us during the 
guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the 
applicable loan or financing program, for a pre-determined resale value. We 
account for such automotive sales as a sale with a right of return when we do 
not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the 
resale value guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to 
determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a 
comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is 
exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s 
economic incentive to exercise. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated 
market values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether
there have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we 
accumulate more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market 
conditions change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. The 
total sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees was$91 
million and$223 million as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively, of 
which$40 million and$91 million was short-term, respectively.

Deferred revenue related to the access to our FSD features, internet 
connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates 
primarily on automotive sales consisted of the following (in millions):

                                                           Year ended December

Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the 
performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of 
the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as 
of December 31, 2021 was$472 million as of December 31, 2022, primarily related 
to the general FSD feature release in North America in the fourth quarter of 
2022. We had recognized revenue of$312 million from the deferred revenue balance
as of December 31, 2020, for the year ended December 31, 2021. Of the total 
deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022, we expect to recognize$639 
million of revenue in the next 12 months. The remaining balance will be 
recognized at the time of transfer of control of the product or over the 
performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.

We have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries during the 
year ended December 31, 2022. We have recorded net financing receivables on the 
consolidated balance sheets, of which $128 million is recorded within Accounts 
receivable, net, for the current portion and $665 million is recorded within 
Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December 31, 2022.

Automotive Regulatory Credits

We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under 
various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean 
fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits 
to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.

Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point 
control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory 
credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the 
time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. 
Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was 
immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021. Revenue recognized from the 
deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 was immaterial for the
years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
we had also recognized $288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation 
which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program

We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs 
in the U. S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers 
are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to48 months. At the 
end of the lease term, customers are generally required to return the vehicles 
to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record 
leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the
contractual term, and we record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of 
automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 
2020, we recognized $1.75 billion, $1.25 billion and $752 million of direct 
vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, we had 
deferred $407 million and $392 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront 
payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual
terms of the individual leases.

Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction 
price of automotive contracts.

Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program

We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan 
arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases(“ASC 
842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific 
program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us 
during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to
return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term
after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a 
right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by 
the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at 
the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Our 
arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to72 months. We 
recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as 
automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively,
upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the 
implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time 
as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 
2022, 2021 and 2020, we recognized $683 million, $369 million and $120 million, 
respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $427 million, $234 million and 
$87 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.

Services and Other Revenue

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle services
and parts, sales of used vehicles, paid Supercharging, retail merchandise and 
vehicle insurance revenue.

Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as 
services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the 
performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a 
stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service
plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone 
selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these 
items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for 
used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point 
when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable 
upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within 
Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related 
to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2022 and 2021.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage Sales

Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy
systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large 
commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to 
residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, 
design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial 
customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. 
Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control 
transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes 
inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy 
storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of 
the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when 
control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are 
performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such 
storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business.

For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage 
system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the 
system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with 
contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized
over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a 
percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and
as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales.

In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single 
contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the 
contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone 
selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using 
market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential 
installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work
in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Any fees that 
are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an 
offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions 
paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and 
energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and
energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs 
to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.

As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may 
provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the 
underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy 
performance requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may
receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. 
Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the 
performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated 
damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial 
and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts 
include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market 
participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments 
represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract 
inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting 
period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are 
included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a 
significant reversal of revenue will not occur.

We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from
customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as 
revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 
2022 and 2021, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted 
to$863 million and$399 million, respectively, mainly due to milestone payments. 
Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2021 and
2020 was$171 million and$93 million for the years ended December 31, 2022 and 
2021, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit disclosure 
of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining performance 
obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original expected 
contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the right to 
invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the performance 
to date. As of December 31, 2022, total transaction price allocated to 
performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for 
contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was$210 
million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize$12 million in the next 12 months
and the remaining over a period up to25 years.

We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products during
the year ended December 31, 2022. We have recorded net financing receivables on 
the consolidated balance sheets, of which $24 million is recorded within 
Accounts receivable, net, for the current portion and $387 million is recorded 
within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion, as of December 31, 
2022.

Energy Generation and Storage Leasing

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue 
from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned 
from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference 
between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred
revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs
prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be 
accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is 
recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under
the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is 
recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of 
December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue related to such customer payments 
amounted to $191 million and $198 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also 
includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies 
and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue 
over the lease term. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, deferred revenue from 
rebates and incentives amounted to $25 million and $27 million, respectively.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar 
energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, 
as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these 
costs over the term of the related agreements.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales

Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor 
costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and 
machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations 
of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and 
reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also
includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying 
value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to
provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

Automotive Leasing

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease 
vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and 
warranty expense related to leased vehicles. Cost of automotive leasing revenue 
also includes vehicle connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and 
infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our 
leasing programs.

Services and Other

Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing 
non-warranty after-sales services and parts, costs of paid Supercharging, cost 
of used vehicles including refurbishment costs, costs for retail merchandise, 
and costs to provide vehicle insurance.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect 
material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other 
overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of 
energy generation and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the 
carrying value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable 
value and to provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted 
demand. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the lessor,
the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased
solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and 
amortization of any initial direct costs.
 |  |  |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“TCJA”) subjects a U. S. shareholder to tax on global
intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. 
Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due 
on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into 
our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which 
we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our 
consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.
 |  |  |
| **  Comprehensive Income** | Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive (loss) 
income. Other comprehensive (loss) income consists of foreign currency 
translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that 
have been excluded from the determination of net income.
 |  |  |
|   Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-Based Compensation

We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs 
granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee services 
received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option 
awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant
or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, 
expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally
require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant 
date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting 
cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to 
provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is
generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. 
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of 
actual forfeitures in the period.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable.

As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we
incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate 
significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially 
impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation 
expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation 
expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of 
operations.

| **  Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests** | Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems 
and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual 
provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We 
have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling 
interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the 
substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the 
hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine
the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the 
HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as 
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests
in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling 
interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance 
sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at 
each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming 
the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined
in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date 
and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the 
results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the 
noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the 
consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, 
after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the 
third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at 
least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest 
balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the 
consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem 
their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there 
may be significant fluctuations in net income attributable to noncontrolling 
interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries due to changes
in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are reached.

| **  Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders** | Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders 
is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the 
weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially 
dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock 
underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes
using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are 
included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock 
attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive.

Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, 
we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11, Debt). 
However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating 
potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The 
strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the 
period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the 
weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common 
stock in the period(s) they are settled.

The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to 
common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income
per share of common stock (in millions):

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other (expense) income, net, in the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.

| **  Cash and Cash Equivalents** | Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents 
are primarily comprised of money market funds and certificates of deposit.
 |  |  |
|   Restricted Cash | Restricted Cash

We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our 
restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain payments 
under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes 
cash held as collateral for certain permits as well as sales to lease partners 
with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases, deposits 
held for our insurance services and certain operating leases. We record 
restricted cash as other assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine
current or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the 
restriction.

| **  Investments** | Investments

Investments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, 
including U. S. government securities, corporate debt securities, time deposit, 
and certain certificates of deposit, which are all designated as 
available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains 
and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included 
within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with 
maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in 
short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest, dividends, 
amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on these 
investments are included within Interest income in our consolidated statements 
of operations.

The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific 
identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of 
available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other (expense) income, net.

We regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The 
review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the 
decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the 
creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of
our investments approximates its fair value.

| **  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts** | Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of 
regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates 
already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts 
receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts 
receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.

Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our
accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer
payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from
our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on 
the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable 
balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically 
transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is 
dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can 
take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing 
timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may 
have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to 
period. As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, we had $753 million and 
$627 million, respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other 
non-current assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

|   Financing Receivables | Financing Receivables

We provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy 
products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance 
for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts
sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered 
adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In 
determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit 
losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that 
affect the collectability of the future cash flows.

When originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the 
proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e. g., FICO score) and other
information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and 
creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit 
history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have 
strong creditworthiness at loan origination.

After origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on 
customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we 
define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at 
least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2022, the 
majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only an 
immaterial balance being past due. Additionally, as of December 31, 2022, the 
majority of our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were 
originated in 2022.

We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which 
provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a 
solar energy system through a30-year loan and were all originated prior to year 
2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses,
are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid 
expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other 
non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of 
allowance for expected credit losses, was $280 million and $299 million, 
respectively, of which $7 million and $11 million were due in the next 12 months
as of December 31, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2022 and 
2021, the allowance for expected credit losses was $37 million and $41 million, 
respectively.

|   Concentration of Risk | Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts 
receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are 
primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested 
in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits.
As of December 31, 2022 and December 31, 2021, no entity represented10% or more 
of our total receivables balance.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the 
inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in 
a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our 
inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition 
and operating results.
 |  |  |
| **  Inventory Valuation** | Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is 
computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which 
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory 
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about 
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of 
our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the
net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us 
to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost
to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change 
in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial 
results.
 |  |  |
| **  Operating Lease Vehicles** | Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are 
classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We
generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the 
straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual 
period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2022 and 
December 31, 2021 was$6.08 billion and$5.28 billion, respectively. Operating 
lease vehicles on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of 
accumulated depreciation of$1.04 billion and$773 million as of December 31, 2022
and December 31, 2021, respectively.
 |  |  |
| **  Digital Assets, Net** | Digital Assets, Net

We currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible 
assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. We have 
ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party 
custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at 
cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, 
net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.

We determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in 
accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement(“ASC 820”), based on quoted 
prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market
for such assets (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each quarter to 
identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in 
the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not 
that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has 
occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset 
quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then 
current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value determined each
quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in
the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the prices 
determined.

Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the 
consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is 
identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point 
they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held
within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon 
sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of 
the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.

See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital 
assets.
 |  |  |
| **  Solar Energy Systems, Net** | Solar Energy Systems, Net

We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems in service               30 to 35 years               
  Initial direct costs related to customer      Lease term (up to 25 years)  

Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy
systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. 
Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under 
installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when 
they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs 
related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are 
capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.
 |  |  |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment, Net** | Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are 
recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally 
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
respective assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and      3 to 15 years   
  Tooling                                 4 to 7 years    
  Building and building improvements      15 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software         3 to 10 years   

Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance 
sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement
of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified 
useful life.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in 
progress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized 
over the life of the related assets.
 |  |  |
| **  Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets** | Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term 
prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may
not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount 
to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If
the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its 
fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we have 
recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to thirty years.
 |  |  |
|   Goodwill | Goodwill

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. 
For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021, and 2020, we did no t recognize any
impairment of goodwill.

|   Capitalization of Software Costs | Capitalization of Software Costs

We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during
the application development stage to Property, plant and equipment, net on the 
consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and
post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are 
amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three 
years.

Software development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, 
leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of 
technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software 
are capitalized when they are expected to become significant. Such costs are 
amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is 
made generally available to our customers.

We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact 
the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2022, 2021,
and 2020, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.

| **  Foreign Currency** | Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U. S. 
dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the 
different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet.
For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to 
its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to 
translate the balance sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other 
(expense) income, net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the 
years ended December 31, 2022, 2021 and 2020, we recorded a net foreign currency
transaction loss of $89 million, gain of $97 million and loss of $114 million, 
respectively.

|   Warranties | Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles anda warranty 
on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems 
we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty 
reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the 
projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if 
identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an 
estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates 
are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and 
changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material 
changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not 
include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to 
operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or
PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The
portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 
months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining 
balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated 
balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues 
in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our 
automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our 
automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in 
millions):

| **  Customer Deposits** | Customer Deposits

Customer deposits primarily consist of cash payments from customers at the time 
they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any 
additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of 
installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on contracts that can 
be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance plans. 
Customer deposit amounts vary depending on the vehicle model, the energy product
and the country of delivery. With the exception of a nominal order fee, customer
deposits are fully refundable on vehicles prior to delivery and fully refundable
in the case of an energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into a
purchase agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter (in 
accordance with applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current 
liabilities until refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase
balance.

| **  Government Assistance Programs and Incentives** | Government Assistance Programs and Incentives

Globally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government 
programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded
in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a 
reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is 
generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met 
or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt. 
The government incentives received by us are immaterial in all periods presented
since the adoption of ASU 2021-10.

Gigafactory New York - New York State Investment and Lease

We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with 
respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and 
development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the 
facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and
cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY 
Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the 
manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain 
manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or 
equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and 
Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility 
within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense 
line items in our consolidated statements of operations.

Gigafactory Shanghai - Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits

We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights 
at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to 
meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target 
starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to
our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection 
with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, 
Commitments and Contingencies). For the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, 
we received grant funding of $76 million and $6 million, respectively. These 
incentives offset the related costs of our facilities and are recorded as a 
reduction of the cost of the capital investment within the Property, plant and 
equipment, net line item in our consolidated balance sheets. The incentive 
therefore reduces the depreciation expense over the useful lives of the related 
equipment.

Nevada Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into 
agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide 
abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and 
transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital 
investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.

Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into 
a20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would 
receive grant funding equal to70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis 
County and a separate10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School 
District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our 
property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our 
meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction 
and operations at Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction 
of the related expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating 
expense line items of our consolidated statements of operations.

| **  Defined Contribution Plan** | Defined Contribution Plan

We have a 401(k) savings plan in the U. S. that is intended to qualify as a 
deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code 
and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, 
participating employees may elect to contribute up to90% of their eligible 
compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we 
began to match50% of each employee’s contributions up to a maximum of6% (capped 
at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested upon one year of 
service. We recognized $91 million of expenses related to employer contributions
for the 401(k) savings plan during the year ended December 31, 2022.

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In October 2021, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 
No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets and Contract Liabilities from 
Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU requires an acquirer in a 
business combination to recognize and measure contract assets and contract 
liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using the revenue 
recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the acquirer applies
the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired contracts. The ASU is 
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2022, including 
interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU should be applied
prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an 
interim period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied retrospectively to 
all business combinations for which the acquisition date occurred during the 
fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is currently not expected to have a material 
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and 
Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled 
debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of 
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. 
This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing 
and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial 
difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to 
require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of 
origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the 
scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after 
December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption
of the ASU would be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, 
including adoption in an interim period. This ASU is currently not expected to 
have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to
promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture 
or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of15% on 
adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1
billion. These measures may materially affect our consolidated financial 
statements, and we will continue to evaluate the applicability and effect of the
IRA as more guidance is issued.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In December 2022, the FASB issued ASU No. 2022-06, Deferral of the Sunset Date 
of Reference Rate Reform (Topic 848). Topic 848 provides optional expedients and
exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by reference rate (e. g., 
LIBOR) reform if certain criteria are met, for a limited period of time to ease 
the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing the effects of) reference
rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU deferred the sunset date of Topic 
848 from December 31, 2022 to December 31, 2024. The ASU is effective as of 
December 21, 2022 through December 31, 2024. We continue to evaluate 
transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of reference rate 
reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an ongoing basis.
We adopted ASU 2022-06 during 2022. The ASU has not and is currently not 
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 
832). This ASU requires business entities to disclose information about 
government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by 
analogy to either a grant or a contribution accounting model. The disclosure 
requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related accounting 
policy used, the line items on the balance sheets and statements of operations 
that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line 
item and the significant terms and conditions of the transactions. The ASU is 
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The disclosure 
requirements can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all 
transactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial 
statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are 
entered into after the date of initial application. We adopted the ASU 
prospectively on January 1, 2022. Adoption of this ASU did not have a material 
impact on our consolidated financial statements.

ASU 2020-06

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible 
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the 
accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in 
ASC 470-20, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible 
instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion 
features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 
815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums 
accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer 
required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt 
instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized 
cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible 
debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when 
applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments 
to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most 
significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for 
diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method.
The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an 
entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from 
derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of 
contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities.

On January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. 
We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment
to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the 
recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt 
remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes 
(mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts 
recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt 
balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to 
previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial 
statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported 
under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 
consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows (in 
millions):
