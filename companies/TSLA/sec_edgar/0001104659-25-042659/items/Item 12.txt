Ownership of Securities

The following table sets forth certain information
regarding the beneficial ownership of Tesla’s common stock, as of December 31, 2024, for the following:

·each person (or group of affiliated persons) who is known by us to beneficially own 5% of the outstanding shares of our common stock;

·each of our non-employee directors;

·each of our current executive officers named in the Summary Compensation Table in Item 11 above; and

·all current directors and executive officers of Tesla as a group.

In computing the number of shares of common stock
beneficially owned by a person and the percentage ownership of that person, we deemed to be outstanding all shares of common stock
subject to options or other convertible securities held by that person or entity that are currently exercisable or exercisable within
60 days of December 31, 2024. We did not deem these shares outstanding, however, for the purpose of computing the percentage
ownership of any other person. Applicable percentage ownership is based on 3,216,138,890 shares of Tesla’s common stock outstanding
at December 31, 2024.
