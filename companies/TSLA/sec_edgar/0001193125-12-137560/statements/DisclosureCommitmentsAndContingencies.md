Environmental Liabilities

In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile 
production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI (see Note 5). 
NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site 
which affect soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts 
to address these conditions. These conditions are now being addressed by us and 
NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed
the environmental issues and we completed a reasonable level of diligence on 
such environmental issues at the time we purchased the facility, we cannot 
determine the exact potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination 
with any certainty. Based on management's best estimate, we estimated the fair 
value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $ 5.3

We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten 15.0 15.0
