| **  Reservation Payments** | 6. Reservation Payments

Reservation payments consist of payments that allow potential customers to hold 
a reservation for the future purchase of a Tesla Roadster or Model S. These 
amounts are recorded as current liabilities until the vehicle is delivered. For 
our Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification, our current purchase 
agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies 
based on the country of purchase. For Model S, we require an initial refundable 
reservation payment of at least $ 5,000

As of December 31, 2011, we held reservation payments for undelivered Model S 
sedans in an aggregate amount of $ 90.0 1.8 28.3 2.5
