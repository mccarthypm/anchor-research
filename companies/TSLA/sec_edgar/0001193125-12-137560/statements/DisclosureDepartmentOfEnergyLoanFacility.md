Our ability to draw down funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon 
several draw conditions. We are currently in compliance with these draw 
conditions. For the Powertrain Facility, the draw conditions include our 
achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain
manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements
with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model S 
Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones 
relating to the design and development of Model S and the Tesla Factory. Certain
advances will be subject to additional conditions to draw-down related to the 
site on which the applicable project is located. Additionally, the DOE Loan 
Facility provides for the ability to update milestones should a reasonable need 
arise.

Advances under the DOE Loan Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance and 
will be based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal 
installments for such advance. Interest on advances under the DOE Loan Facility 
is payable quarterly in arrears. Advances under the Powertrain Facility are 
repayable in 28 December 15, 2012 26 September 15, 2019 40 December 15, 2012 38

Under the DOE Loan Facility, we have committed to pay all costs and expenses 
incurred to complete the projects being financed in excess of amounts funded 
under the loan facility. We will be required to maintain, at all times, 
available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105

The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among 
others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the 
business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM 
Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur 
indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or 
acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital 
stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates,
enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and
enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary 
exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary financial 
covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current 
liabilities, and (i) through November 30, 2012, a minimum cash balance, (ii) 
after September 30, 2012, a limit on capital expenditures, (iii) after June 30, 
2013, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum 
fixed charge coverage ratio, and (iv) after March 31, 2014, a maximum ratio of 
total liabilities to shareholder equity. We are in compliance with our current 
applicable financial covenants. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain 
customary events of default, subject in some cases to customary cure periods for
certain defaults. In addition, events of default include a failure of Elon Musk,
our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman, and certain of his 
affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating
to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65

Under the DOE Loan Facility, we have agreed to fund a debt service reserve 
account. On or before February 29, 2012, we have agreed to fund an amount equal 
to all principal and interest that will come due on December 15, 2012, and on or
before October 15, 2012, we have agreed to fund an amount equal to all principal
and interest that will come due on March 15, 2013 and June 15, 2013. Once we 
have deposited such amounts, we will not be required to further fund such debt 
service reserve account.

We have also agreed that, in connection with the sale of our common stock in an 
IPO, at least 75 50

Upon completion of our IPO in 2010, we set aside $ 100 30

DOE Warrant

In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued a 
warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 2.51 July 2, 2010 3,090,111 7.54 
December 15, 2018and untilDecember 14, 2022 December 15, 2023

Since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the warrants will vary 
depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual 
vesting period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock 
price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest 
rates, we measured the fair value of the warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation 
approach. The Monte Carlo approach simulates and captures the optimal decisions 
to be made between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE 
warrant. For the purposes of the simulation, the optimal decision represents the
scenario with the lowest economic cost to us. The total warrant value would then
be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths 
discounted to our valuation date.

The prepayment feature which allows us to prepay the DOE Loan Facility and 
consequently, affect the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE 
warrant, was determined to represent an embedded derivative. This embedded 
derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant 
liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the fair value of the 
embedded derivative are reflected as part of the warrant liability 
re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet reporting date.

The warrant is recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair 
value reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. The fair
value of the warrant at issuance was $ 6.3 0.5 0.9 13 0.6 0.6

Prior to the completion of our IPO, the fair value of the DOE warrant was 
included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the 
consolidated balance sheet. Upon the completion of our IPO on July 2, 2010, this
warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible 
preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability. The DOE 
warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in
the fair value reflected in other expense, net, as the number of common stock 
ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or 
vesting. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the DOE warrant was
$ 8.8 6.1 2.8 0.2
