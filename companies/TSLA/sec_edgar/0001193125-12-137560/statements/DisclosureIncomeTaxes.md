Management believes that based on the available information, it is more likely 
than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a full 
valuation allowance is required against all U. S. deferred tax assets.

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $ 605 352 21 2024 2019 10.9 11.5 
2019

We have indefinitely reinvested $ 2.2

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an "ownership 
change," as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Prior to our 
IPO, we performed a study and had determined that no significant limitation 
would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit 
carry-forwards as a result of prior ownership changes. We do not believe that 
our public offerings and private placements constituted an ownership change 
resulting in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax 
credit carry-forwards; however, we have not yet performed a study subsequent to 
our IPO to determine whether such limitations exist.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the 
recognition, measurement and presentation of uncertain tax positions. As a 
result, we recorded net unrecognized tax benefits of $ 11.5

The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits 
during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in 
thousands):
