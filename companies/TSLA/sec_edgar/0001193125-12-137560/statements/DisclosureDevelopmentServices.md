Daimler AG

Daimler Smart Fortwo EV Program

In May 2009, we and Daimler formalized a development arrangement related to 
Daimler's Smart fortwo electric vehicle program under which we were performing 
powertrain development activities since 2008. In May 2009, we entered into an 
agreement with Daimler related to the development of a battery pack and charger 
for Daimler's Smart fortwo electric drive. We began development efforts in the 
year ended December 31, 2008 and began receiving payments to compensate us for 
the cost of our development activities prior to entering into the formal 
agreement in May 2009. We received aggregate payments in the amount of $ 10.2 
14.5 8.7

We recognized the $ 14.5 23.2

Upon completion of the development activities, we began selling powertrain 
components to Daimler for the Smart fortwo EV program. Powertrain component 
sales are recorded in automotive sales revenue and during the years ended 
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized revenue of $ 7.2 21.1 0.4

Daimler A-Class Program

During the three months ended March 31, 2010, Daimler also engaged us to assist 
with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot 
fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in Europe during 2011. 
We began providing development services for this program during the three months
ended March 31, 2010 and had received an aggregate of $ 5.5 14.4

As of December 31, 2010, all development work related to the A-Class EV 
development program had been completed and as such, no further development 
services revenue were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011. Costs of
development services incurred prior to the finalization of the A-Class agreement
were recorded as research and development expenses. During the three months 
ended March 31, 2010, we recorded $ 0.5

Toyota Motor Corporation

Toyota RAV4 Program

In July 2010, we and Toyota entered into a Phase 0 agreement to initiate 
development of an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. Under this early 
phase development agreement, prototypes would be made by us by combining the 
Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric powertrain. We began producing and 
delivering prototypes to Toyota during the three months ended September 30, 
2010. Pursuant to the agreement, Toyota would pay us up to $ 9 7.6 1.3

In October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with 
Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery
pack, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which 
will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Pursuant
to the agreement, Toyota will pay us up to $ 60.0 5.0 47.4 3.3 250,000 4.0

In July 2011, we entered into a supply and services agreement with Toyota for 
the supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a battery pack, 
charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be
integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Additionally, we
will provide Toyota with certain services related to the supply of the electric 
powertrain system. We plan to begin delivery of the electric powertrain system 
to Toyota for installation into the Toyota RAV4 EV in 2012 and as such, no 
payments have been received and no revenue has been recognized to date under 
this agreement. Future revenue to be recognized under this agreement will be 
recorded in automotive sales. Our production activities under this program are 
expected to continue through 2014.
