In July 2003, we adopted the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the 
effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on June 28, 2010 (see 
Note 10), we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan) and all remaining
common shares reserved for future grant or issuance under the 2003 Equity 
Incentive Plan were added to the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The Plan provides 
for the granting of stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, 
directors and consultants of Tesla. Options granted under the Plan may be either
incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be 
granted only to our employees including officers and directors. Nonqualified 
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and 
consultants. Generally, our stock options vest over four ten

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i. 
e., the difference between our common stock price and the exercise price, 
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received 
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options. The 
aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 
2010 was $ 243.9 250.1 142.8 75.7 220.5 203.0 27.8 10.0

Fair Value Adoption

We adopted the fair value method on January 1, 2006 in recognizing stock-based 
compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimated the fair value 
of each option award and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) on the grant 
date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the weighted average 
assumptions noted in the following table.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for option awards granted during the

The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options has 
historically been determined by the Board of Directors as there was no public 
market for our common stock. The Board of Directors has determined fair value of
the common stock at the time of each grant of options by considering a number of
objective and subjective factors including valuation of comparable companies, 
sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties, operating and 
financial performance, the lack of liquidity of capital stock, and trends in the
broader automobile industry. We have not granted stock options with an exercise 
price that is less than the fair value of the underlying common stock as 
determined at the time of grant by our Board of Directors, with input from 
management. The fair market value of the underlying common stock was determined 
by the Board of Directors until the completion of our IPO when our common stock 
was listed on an established stock exchange.

Information regarding our stock option grants during 2009 and the six months 
prior to the completion of our IPO, including the grant date; the number of 
stock options issued with each grant; and the exercise price, which equals the 
grant date fair value of the underlying common stock for each grant of stock 
options, is summarized as follows:

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the 
periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances. As required,
we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, if any, as 
financing cash flows rather than operating cash flows.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $ 55.2 2.38

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Concurrent with the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on 
June 28, 2010 (see Note 10), we established the ESPP. Under the ESPP, employees 
are eligible to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15 85
