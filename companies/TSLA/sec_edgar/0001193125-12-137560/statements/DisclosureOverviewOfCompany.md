|   Overview Of The Company | 1. Overview of the Company

Tesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of 
Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell 
high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle 
powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, 
Europe and Asia. The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to market and/or 
service our vehicles.

Since inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately
$ 445.0 280.3

Unadjusted Error in 2009

In June 2010, we identified an error related to the understatement in 
stock-based compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we granted certain stock options for which a 
portion of the grant was immediately vested. We erroneously accounted for the 
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the award, while expense 
recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards 
vesting during the period. As a result, selling, general and administrative 
expenses and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 were understated by $
2.7

To correct this error, we recorded additional stock-based compensation of $ 2.4
