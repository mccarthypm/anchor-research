Tesla Factory

In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile 
production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI, which is a joint 
venture between Toyota, and Motors Liquidation Company, the owner of selected 
assets of General Motors. In October 2010 42.0 210 55 6.5

NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site 
which affect soil and groundwater, and is currently undertaking efforts to 
address these conditions. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has 
documented and managed the environmental issues, we cannot determine with 
certainty the total potential costs to remediate pre-existing contamination. 
Based on management's best estimate, we estimated the fair value of the 
environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $ 5.3

The purchase consideration for the Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California 
consisted of cash paid of $ 48.5 5.3 53.8 53.8

  Building and site improvements      13,556  
  Land                                25,736  
  Emission credits                    14,508  
                                      53,800  

Building and site improvements are classified within construction in progress 
and together with land, are recorded in property, plant and equipment, net, on 
the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair value of land was determined 
using the market approach. Although the market approach compares the subject 
asset purchase to similar transactions which would otherwise classify these 
inputs within Level II of the fair value hierarchy, adjustments we made to 
comparable sales both qualitatively and quantitatively caused us to classify 
these inputs within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the
building and site improvements were estimated using the cost approach and 
therefore, the inputs are classified within Level III of the fair value 
hierarchy. Incremental due diligence costs of $ 0.7

Emission credits are classified as intangible assets and are recorded in other 
noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair value of
emission credits was determined using market data related to traded emission 
credits and as such, these inputs are classified within Level I of the fair 
value hierarchy. The utility of the emission credits are related to the 
operation of the Tesla Factory and therefore, will be amortized over the same 
useful life. As the Tesla Factory is not yet ready for its intended use, we have
not yet commenced the depreciation of the Tesla Factory or the amortization of 
the emission credits. We currently estimate that building and building 
improvements, as well as the emission credits, will have an estimated useful 
life of 30

Manufacturing Assets

In August 2010, we entered into a separate purchase agreement with NUMMI for the
purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and spare parts located at the 
Fremont facility. This purchase agreement was subsequently amended to include 
additional manufacturing equipment and spare parts. In October 2010, we 
completed this purchase concurrent with the completion of the facility purchase.
The aggregate purchase price for these assets was $ 16.7 15
