|   Use Of Estimates | Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting 
period, including revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranties, fair 
value of financial instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates.

| **  Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenues from sales of the Tesla Roadster, including vehicle 
options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of zero emission vehicle 
(ZEV) credits, and sales of electric vehicle powertrain components. We recognize
revenue when: (i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery 
has occurred and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii)
fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.

Effective January 1, 2011, we adopted amended accounting standards issued by the
Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB) for multiple deliverable revenue 
arrangements on a prospective basis for applicable transactions originating or 
materially modified after January 1, 2011. The new standard changes the 
requirements for establishing separate units of accounting in a multiple element
arrangement and requires the allocation of arrangement consideration to each 
deliverable to be based on the relative selling price. For fiscal 2011 and 
future periods, when a sales arrangement contains multiple elements, we allocate
revenue to each element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price 
for a deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if 
available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated 
selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is available. To date, we have been able 
to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple 
element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles, vehicles accessories 
and options separately, outside of any multiple element arrangements. Therefore,
there were no material differences between total revenue reported and pro forma 
total revenues that would have been reported during the year ended December 31, 
2011, if the transactions entered into or materially modified after January 1, 
2011 were subject to previous accounting guidance.

Automotive Sales

Automotive sales consisted of the following for the periods presented (in 
thousands):

148,568      $         97,078      $         111,943  

Automotive sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sales of the Tesla
Roadster, vehicle service, and vehicle options, accessories and destination 
charges as well as sales of ZEV credits. Automotive sales also consist of 
revenue earned from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain components, such as
battery packs and battery chargers, to other automotive manufacturers. Sales or 
other amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition 
criteria are not recognized in the consolidated statements of operations and are
instead recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Prior 
to February 2010, we did not provide direct financing for the purchase of the 
Tesla Roadster although a third-party lender has provided financing arrangements
to our customers in the United States. Under these arrangements, we have been 
paid in full by the customer at the time of purchase.

In regards to the sale of Tesla Roadsters, revenue is generally recognized upon 
delivery of the vehicle. Concurrent with a purchase order for a Roadster that is
manufactured to specification, customers must remit a reservation payment (see 
Note 6). For vehicles purchased directly from our showrooms, no deposit is 
required. Approximately three months prior to production of a Tesla Roadster 
manufactured to specification, the reservation payment becomes nonrefundable 
when the customer enters into a purchase agreement. In a limited number of 
circumstances, we may deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options
ordered by the customer if the options do not limit the functionality of the 
vehicle. This may happen, for example, in an instance where the customer orders 
an additional hard top which is not ready at the time the vehicle is delivered. 
In such cases, we will continue to defer the related revenue based on the 
undelivered item's fair value, as evidenced by the contractual price of the 
option in stand-alone transactions.

Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the sales of vehicle 
options, accessories and destination charges. While these sales may take place 
separately from a vehicle sale, they are often part of one vehicle sale 
agreement resulting in multiple element arrangements. Contract interpretation is
sometimes required to determine the appropriate accounting for recognition of 
our revenue, including whether the deliverables specified in the multiple 
element arrangement should be treated as separate units of accounting, and, if 
so, how the price should be allocated among the elements, when to recognize 
revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should be 
recognized. We are also required to evaluate whether a delivered item has value 
on a stand-alone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by determining 
whether we have made separate sales of such items or whether the undelivered 
items are essential to the functionality of the delivered items. Further, we 
assess whether we know the fair value of the undelivered items, determined by 
reference to stand-alone sales of such items. To date, we have been able to 
establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within the multiple 
element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles, vehicle accessories 
and options separately, outside of any multiple element arrangements. As each of
these items has stand alone value to the customer, revenue from sales of vehicle
accessories and options are recognized when those specific items are delivered 
to the customer. Increased complexity to our sales agreements or changes in our 
judgments and estimates regarding application of these revenue recognition 
guidelines could result in a change in the timing or amount of revenue 
recognized in future periods.

In February 2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in 
the United States for the Tesla Roadster. Through our wholly owned subsidiary, 
qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla Roadster for 36 0.8 1.1 
3.0 0.8

Zero Emission Vehicle Credit Sales

California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle 
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in 
that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. These laws provide
that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn credits, referred to as 
ZEV credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such 
credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. As a manufacturer solely 
of zero emission vehicles, we have earned ZEV credits on vehicles sold in such 
states, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. Since our
only commercial vehicle is electric, we do not receive any benefit from the 
generation of ZEV credits, and accordingly look to sell them to other vehicle 
manufacturers. In order to facilitate the sale of these credits, we enter into 
contractual agreements with third parties requiring them to purchase our ZEV 
credits at pre-determined prices. We recognize revenue on the sale of these 
credits at the time legal title to the credits is transferred to the purchasing 
party by the governmental agency issuing the credits. Revenue from the sale of 
ZEV credits totaled $ 2.7 2.8 8.2

Extended Service and Battery Replacement Plans

We provide customers with the opportunity to purchase an extended warranty for 
the period after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty to extend 
coverage for an additional three 36,000 1.5 1.2

Additionally, within three months of purchasing a vehicle, we provide customers 
with a one-time option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at any 
time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the 
tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. We refer to this 
program as our Battery Replacement Plan. Amounts collected on these sales are 
initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and 
recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the 
battery packs. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, we had deferred $ 1.2 0.9

Development Services Revenue

Revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from 
the development of electric vehicle powertrain components for other automobile 
manufacturers, including the design and development of battery packs, chargers 
and sample vehicles to meet a customer's specifications. Beginning in the 
quarter ended March 31, 2010, we started entering into such contracts with the 
expectation that our development services would constitute a viable 
revenue-generating activity. Revenue is recognized as the performance 
requirements of each development arrangement are met and collection is 
reasonably assured. Where development arrangements include substantive at-risk 
milestones, revenue is recognized based upon the achievement of the 
contractually-defined milestones. Amounts collected in advance of meeting all of
the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated 
statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred revenue on the 
consolidated balance sheets. Costs of development services are expensed as 
incurred. When development services arrangements have multiple elements, we 
evaluate the separability of the various deliverables to ensure appropriate 
revenue recognition. Costs of development services incurred in periods prior to 
the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and development 
expenses; once an agreement is finalized, these costs are recorded in cost of 
revenues.

Prior to 2010, compensation from the Smart fortwo EV development arrangement 
with Daimler AG (Daimler) (see Note 14), was recorded as an offset to research 
and development expenses. This early arrangement was motivated primarily by the 
opportunity to engage Daimler and at the same time, jointly progress our own 
research and development activities with the associated development 
compensation. All amounts received under the Smart fortwo EV agreement were 
recognized as an offset to research and development expenses, as we were 
performing development activities on behalf of Daimler, were being compensated 
for the cost of these activities and could not practicably separate the efforts 
or costs related to these activities from our own research and development.
 |  |  |
| **  Freestanding Stock Warrants** | Freestanding Stock Warrants

We accounted for freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible 
preferred stock as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value 
upon issuance. The convertible preferred stock warrants were recorded as a 
liability because the underlying shares of convertible preferred stock were 
contingently redeemable which therefore, may have obligated us to transfer 
assets at some point in the future (see Note 8). The warrants were subject to 
re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet date and any change in fair 
value was recognized in other expense, net, on the consolidated statements of 
operations. For our Series C and other Series E convertible preferred stock 
warrants, excluding the Department of Energy (DOE) warrant, we adjusted the 
liability for changes in fair value through the completion of our IPO on July 2,
2010. At that time, the convertible preferred stock warrants were net exercised 
and the related liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital. For 
the Series E convertible preferred stock warrants issued to the DOE (see Note 
9), we adjust the liability for changes in fair value until the earlier of 
vesting or expiration of the warrants. Upon the completion of our IPO, the DOE 
warrant converted into a warrant to purchase our common stock and the related 
liability will continue to be adjusted for changes in fair value until the 
earlier of vesting or expiration of the warrants. If the warrants are exercised,
the warrant liability will be reclassified to common stock or additional paid-in
capital, as applicable.
 |  |  |
| **  Cash And Cash Equivalents** | Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three 
months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. We
currently deposit excess cash primarily in money market funds.
 |  |  |
|   Marketable Securities | Marketable Securities

During the year ended December 31, 2011, we purchased marketable securities 
including commercial paper and corporate debt. All marketable securities are 
designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with 
unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss 
which is included within stockholders' equity. Realized gains and losses on the 
sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other expense, 
net. The cost of available-for-sale marketable securities sold is based on the 
specific identification method. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion 
of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in 
other expense, net. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities 
greater than three months at the date of purchase and remaining maturities of 
one year or less are classified as short-term marketable securities. Where 
temporary declines in fair value exist, we have the ability and the intent to 
hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any 
anticipated recovery in fair value.

We regularly review all of our marketable securities for other-than-temporary 
declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to (i) the 
consideration of the cause of the impairment, (ii) the creditworthiness of the 
security issuers, (iii) the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss 
position, and (iv) our ability to hold the security for a period of time 
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
 |  |  |
|   Restricted Cash And Deposits | Restricted Cash and Deposits

We maintain certain cash amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. We 
maintained total restricted cash of approximately $ 31.5 78.5
 |  |  |
| **  Accounts Receivable And Allowance For Doubtful Accounts** | Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain 
components and the performance of powertrain development services. In 
circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer's inability to meet its 
financial obligations to us, we provide an allowance against amounts receivable 
to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we reasonably believes 
will be collected. We typically do not carry accounts receivable related to our 
vehicle and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle 
delivery.
 |  |  |
| **  Concentration Of Risk** | Concentration of Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash 
and accounts receivable. Our cash and cash equivalents are primarily invested in
money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions in the United
States. At times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured 
limits. We invest cash not required for use in operations in high credit quality
securities based on our investment policy. Our investment policy provides 
guidelines and limits regarding credit quality, investment concentration, 
investment type, and maturity that we believe will provide liquidity while 
reducing risk of loss of capital. Investments are of a short-term nature and 
include investments in corporate debt securities.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, our accounts receivable were derived primarily
from sales of powertrain components to Daimler and the development of powertrain
systems for Toyota Motor Corporation (Toyota) (see Note 14).

The following summarizes the accounts receivable in excess of 10

               December 31,              December 31,          
  Toyota                         52                        42  
  Daimler                        38                        51  

Single source suppliers provide us with a number of components that meet our 
manufacturing requirements. For example, Lotus Cars Limited (Lotus) is the only 
manufacturer for certain components, such as the chassis of our Tesla Roadster. 
In other instances, although there may be multiple suppliers available, many of 
the components used in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If
these single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis
at competitive prices, we could suffer manufacturing delays, a possible loss of 
revenues, or incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our
operating results.
 |  |  |
| **  Inventories And Inventory Valuation** | Inventories and Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using 
standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We
record inventory write-downs based on reviews for excess and obsolescence 
determined primarily by future demand forecasts. We also adjust the carrying 
value of our inventories when we believe that the net realizable value is less 
than the carrying value. These write-downs are measured as the difference 
between the cost of the inventory, including estimated costs to complete, and 
estimated selling prices. Once inventory is written down, a new, lower-cost 
basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and 
circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly 
established cost basis.
 |  |  |
| **  Property, Plant And Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

  Computer equipment and software                3 years       
  Office furniture, machinery and equipment      3 to 7 years  
  Tooling                                        3 to 5 years  

Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease. Upon 
retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated depreciation are removed 
from the balance sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in 
operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred, while 
major improvements that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and 
depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life. Land is not 
depreciated.

In October 2010, we completed the purchase of our Tesla Factory located in 
Fremont, California and certain manufacturing assets and spare parts located 
thereon. As these assets are not yet ready for their intended use, they are 
classified within construction in progress and depreciation has not yet 
commenced (see Note 5).

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in 
progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is amortized over the
life of the related assets.
 |  |  |
| **  Operating Lease Vehicles** | Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles that are leased as part of our leasing program, are classified as 
operating lease vehicles. Operating lease vehicles are recorded at cost less 
accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using the straight-line 
method over the term of operating leases of three 13.7 8.4 2.0 0.4
 |  |  |
| **  Intangible Assets** | Intangible Assets

Intangible assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated 
useful lives. As of December 31, 2011, intangible assets are comprised of 
emission credits (see Note 5).
 |  |  |
| **  Long-Lived Assets** | Long-lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for indicators 
of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Impairment exists if the 
carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted 
cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Should impairment exist, the
impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the 
asset over the asset's estimated fair value. As of December 31, 2011, we have 
not recorded any impairment losses on our long-lived assets.
 |  |  |
|   Research And Development Costs | Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and 
development expenses consist primarily of payroll, benefits and stock-based 
compensation of those employees engaged in research, design and development 
activities, costs related to design tools, license expenses related to 
intellectual property, supplies and services, depreciation and other occupancy 
costs. Also included in research and development are development services costs 
incurred, if any, prior to the finalization of agreements with our development 
services customers as reaching a final agreement and revenue recognition is not 
assured. Development services costs incurred after the finalization of an 
agreement are recorded in cost of revenues.
 |  |  |
| **  Advertising And Promotion Costs** | Advertising and Promotion Costs

Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years
ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, advertising, promotion and related 
marketing expenses were $ 2.9 3.1 1.7
 |  |  |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.
 |  |  |
|   Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options. The fair value of share-based payment awards are 
estimated on the grant date using an option pricing model. Stock-based 
compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis over the service 
period, net of estimated forfeitures.

We have elected to use the "with and without" approach in determining the order 
in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, we will only recognize a tax 
benefit from stock-based awards in additional paid-in capital if an incremental 
tax benefit is realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us
have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the indirect 
effects of stock-based awards on other tax attributes, such as the research tax 
credit, through our consolidated statement of operations.

We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair 
value of the awards. The fair value of the awards granted to non-employees is 
re-measured as the awards vest and the resulting change in fair value, if any, 
is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the period the
related services are rendered.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable.
 |  |  |
| **  Foreign Currency Remeasurement And Transactions** | Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Transactions

For each of our foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency is the U. S. 
Dollar. For these foreign subsidiaries, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in non-U. S. currencies are re-measured to U. S. Dollars using 
current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in non-U. S. currencies are maintained at historical
U. S. Dollar exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are re-measured at average U.
S. Dollar monthly rates.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other 
expense, net in the consolidated statements of operations and have not been 
significant for any periods presented.

We hedge a portion of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding 
monetary assets and liabilities using foreign currency exchange forward 
contracts. In general, the market risk related to these contracts is offset by 
corresponding gains and losses on the hedged transactions. The credit risk 
associated with these contracts is driven by changes in interest and currency 
exchange rates and, as a result, varies over time. These contracts are not 
designated as hedges, and as a result, changes in their fair value are recorded 
in interest and other income, net, on our consolidated statements of operations.
We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading purposes.
 |  |  |
| **  Comprehensive Loss** | Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other 
comprehensive loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on our 
available-for-sale marketable securities that have been excluded from the 
determination of net loss.

|   Warranties | Warranties

We began recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster 
sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a warranty of four

We provide a warranty on all vehicle and production powertrain component and 
battery pack sales, and we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or 
production powertrain component is delivered to the customer. Warranty reserves 
include management's best estimate of the projected costs to repair or to 
replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it 
becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of 
historical data. We review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our 
accruals are adequate in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we 
will adjust our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component
of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of
the warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12 months from 
the balance sheet date is classified as current, while the remaining amount is 
classified as long-term liabilities.

|   Environmental Liabilities | Environmental Liabilities

We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations for the protection of 
the environment, including those related to the discharge of hazardous materials
and remediation of contaminated sites. In October 2010, we completed the 
purchase of our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California from New United 
Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI has previously identified environmental
conditions at the Fremont site which affect soil and groundwater. As the owner 
of the Fremont site, we may be responsible for the entire investigation and 
remediation of any environmental contamination at the Fremont site, whether it 
occurred before or after the date we purchased the property. Upon the completion
of the purchase in October 2010, we recorded the estimated fair value of the 
environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $ 5.3
 |  |  |
| **  Net Loss Per Share Of Common Stock** | Net Loss per Share of Common Stock

Our basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock is calculated by 
dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for
the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the number of shares
underlying outstanding stock options, warrants and other convertible securities,
are not included when their effect is antidilutive.

The following table presents the potential common shares outstanding that were 
excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share of common 
stock for the periods presented:
