| **  Fair Value Of Financial Instruments** | 4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, 
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate 
their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the 
fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier
fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
(Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are 
observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in
which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own 
assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when 
available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair 
value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our liabilities that are 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis consist of our common stock warrant 
liability.

All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised 
primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value
hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices 
for similar securities. Our short-term marketable securities are classified 
within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to 
determine fair value of these investments. Our common stock warrant liability 
(see Note 9) is classified within Level III of the fair value hierarchy.

As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value hierarchy for our financial 
assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows 
(in thousands):

We operate in various foreign countries, which exposes us to foreign currency 
exchange risk between the U. S. dollar and various foreign currencies, the most 
significant of which have been the British pound and Japanese yen. In order to 
manage this risk, we enter into foreign currency forward contracts. These 
contracts are not designated as hedges, and as a result, changes in their fair 
value are recorded in interest and other income, net, on our consolidated 
statements of operations. During the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 
2009, net gains and losses related to these instruments were not significant. We
had notional amounts on foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding of $ 8.8
