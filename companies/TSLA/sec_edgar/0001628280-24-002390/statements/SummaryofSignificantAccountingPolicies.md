Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with GAAP and reflect our accounts and operations and those of our 
subsidiaries in which we have a controlling financial interest. In accordance 
with the provisions of ASC 810, Consolidation(“ASC 810”), we consolidate any 
variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We 
have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of 
business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain 
attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct 
vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial 
interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; 
however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as 
VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC
810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has 
the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that 
could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not 
consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not
considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary 
beneficiary of all the VIEs (see Note 16, Variable Interest Entity 
Arrangements). We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing 
basis to ensure that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany
transactions and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the
accompanying notes. The estimates used for, but not limited to, determining 
significant economic incentive for resale value guarantee arrangements, sales 
return reserves, income taxes, the collectability of accounts and finance 
receivables, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of long-lived assets, 
goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, fair value and residual value of 
operating lease vehicles and solar energy systems subject to leases could be 
impacted. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific events 
or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions or 
materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the 
date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change 
as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could
differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or 
conditions.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current 
period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the 
accompanying notes.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to cash and financing 
deliveries of new vehicles, and specific other features and services that meet 
the definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to 
our FSD Capability features and their ongoing maintenance, internet 
connectivity, free Supercharging programs and over-the-air software updates. We 
recognize revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is 
when the control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the 
point control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the 
business, except sales we finance for which payments are collected over the 
contractual loan term. We also recognize a sales return reserve based on 
historical experience plus consideration for expected future market values, when
we offer resale value guarantees or similar buyback terms. Other features and 
services such as access to our internet connectivity, unlimited free 
Supercharging and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control 
transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we 
have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. Other 
limited free Supercharging incentives are recognized based on actual usage or 
expiration, whichever is earlier. We recognize revenue related to these other 
features and services over the performance period, which is generally the 
expected ownership life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD Capability 
features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer and their
ongoing maintenance is recognized over time. For our obligations related to 
automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by considering costs used
to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and 
other information that may be available.

Any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange 
the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue. 
Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales 
personnel for the sale of vehicles. As our contract costs related to automotive 
sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract 
are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and 
handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have elected to 
recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over vehicles, parts or
accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in cost of automotive
sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the
transaction price of automotive contracts.

We offer resale value guarantees to our commercial banking partners in 
connection with certain vehicle leasing programs. Under these programs, we 
originate the lease with our end customer and immediately transfer the lease and
the underlying vehicle to our commercial banking partner, with the transaction 
being accounted for as a sale under ASC 606. We receive upfront payment for the 
vehicle, do not bear casualty and credit risks during the lease term, and we 
provide a guarantee capped to a limit if they are unable to sell the vehicle at 
or above the vehicle’s contract residual value at the end of the lease term. We 
estimate a guarantee liability in accordance with ASC 460, Guarantees and record
it within other liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet. On a quarterly 
basis, we assess the estimated market value of vehicles sold under this program 
to determine whether there have been changes to the amount of expected resale 
value guarantee payments. As we accumulate more data related to the resale 
values of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material 
changes to their estimated values. The total guarantee liability on vehicles 
sold under this program was immaterial as of December 31, 2023.

Deferred revenue related to the access to our FSD Capability features and their 
ongoing maintenance, internet connectivity, free Supercharging programs and 
over-the-air software updates primarily on automotive sales consisted of the 
following (in millions):

                                                           Year Ended December

Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the 
performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of 
the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as 
of December 31, 2022 was $469 million for the year ended December 31, 2023. We 
had recognized revenue of $472 million from the deferred revenue balance as of 
December 31, 2021, for the year ended December 31, 2022, primarily related to 
the general FSD Capability feature release in North America in the fourth 
quarter of 2022. Of the total deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2023, 
we expect to recognize $926 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The 
remaining balance will be recognized at the time of transfer of control of the 
product or over the performance period as discussed above in Automotive Sales.

We have been providing loans for financing our automotive deliveries in volume 
since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have recorded net 
financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which $242 million 
and $128 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts receivable, net, for
the current portion and $1.04 billion and $665 million, respectively, is 
recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term portion.

Automotive Regulatory Credits

We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under 
various regulations related to ZEVs, greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean 
fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who can use the credits 
to comply with emission standards and other regulatory requirements.

Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point 
control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory 
credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the 
time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. 
Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was 
immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and 2022. Revenue recognized from the 
deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2022 and 2021 was immaterial for the
years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022. During the year ended December 31, 2022,
we had also recognized $288 million in revenue due to changes in regulation 
which entitled us to additional consideration for credits sold previously.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program

We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs 
in the U. S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers 
are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to 48 months. At the
end of the lease term, customers are generally required to return the vehicles 
to us. We account for these leasing transactions as operating leases. We record 
leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue

Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction 
price of automotive contracts.

Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program

We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan 
arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842, Leases(“ASC 
842”), in certain countries in Asia and Europe. Depending on the specific 
program, customers may or may not have a right to return the vehicle to us 
during or at the end of the lease term. If the customer does not have a right to
return, the customer will take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term
after making all contractual payments. Under the programs for which there is a 
right to return, the purchase option is reasonably certain to be exercised by 
the lessee and we therefore expect the customer to take title to the vehicle at 
the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. Our 
arrangements under these programs can have terms for up to 72 months. We 
recognize all revenue and costs associated with the sales-type lease as 
automotive leasing revenue and automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively,
upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Interest income based on the 
implicit rate in the lease is recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time 
as customers are invoiced on a monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021, we recognized $215 million, $683 million and $369 million, 
respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and $164 million, $427 million and 
$234 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.

Services and Other Revenue

Services and other revenue consists of sales of used vehicles, non-warranty 
after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid Supercharging, vehicle 
insurance revenue and retail merchandise.

Revenues related to repair, maintenance and vehicle insurance services are 
recognized over time as services are provided and extended service plans are 
recognized over the performance period of the service contract as the obligation
represents a stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, 
services, service plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus 
use standalone selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent 
that these items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. 
Payment for used vehicles, services, vehicle components, and merchandise are 
typically received at the point when control transfers to the customer or in 
accordance with payment terms customary to the business. Payments received for 
prepaid plans are refundable upon customer cancellation of the related contracts
and are included within Customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. We
record in Deferred revenue any non-refundable prepayment amounts that are 
collected from customers and unearned insurance premiums, which is recognized as
revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. Deferred revenue 
excluding unearned insurance premiums was immaterial as of December 31, 2023 and
2022.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage Sales

Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy
systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large 
commercial and utility grade customers. Sales of solar energy systems to 
residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, 
design and installation of the system. Residential and small scale commercial 
customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. 
Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when control 
transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system passes 
inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy 
storage systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of 
the installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when 
control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are 
performing installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such 
storage systems is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business.

For large commercial and utility grade energy storage system sales which consist
of the engineering, design and installation of the system, customers make 
milestone payments that are consistent with contract-specific phases of a 
project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized over time using the 
percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a percentage of total 
estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales.

In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single 
contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the 
contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone 
selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using 
market data for comparable products. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to
commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of energy storage 
systems. As our contract costs related to energy storage system sales are 
typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed
as incurred.

As part of our energy storage system contracts, we may provide the customer with
performance guarantees that warrant that the underlying system will meet or 
exceed the minimum energy performance requirements specified in the contract. If
an energy storage system does not meet the performance guarantee requirements, 
we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other forms of variable 
consideration related to our large commercial and utility grade energy storage 
system contracts include variable customer payments that will be made based on 
our energy market participation activities. Such guarantees and variable 
customer payments represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated 
at contract inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each
reporting period as additional performance data becomes available. Such 
estimates are included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is 
probable a significant reversal of revenue will not occur.

We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from
customers related to fees charged for prepayments, which is recognized as 
revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 
2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to 
$1.60 billion and $863 million, respectively, mainly due to contractual payment 
terms. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 
2022 and 2021 was $571 million and $171 million for the years ended December 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively. We have elected the practical expedient to omit 
disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to remaining 
performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with an original
expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we have the 
right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value of the 
performance to date. As of December 31, 2023, total transaction price allocated 
to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially unsatisfied for 
contracts with an original expected length of more than one year was $3.43 
billion. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $1.05 billion in the next 12 
months and the rest over the remaining performance obligation period.

We have been providing loans for financing our energy generation products in 
volume since fiscal year 2022. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we have 
recorded net financing receivables on the consolidated balance sheets, of which 
$31 million and $24 million, respectively, is recorded within Accounts 
receivable, net, for the current portion and $578 million and $387 million, 
respectively, is recorded within Other non-current assets for the long-term 
portion.

Energy Generation and Storage Leasing

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue 
from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned 
from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference 
between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred
revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs
prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be 
accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840, Leases. Revenue is 
recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under
the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized, which is 
recognized as revenue ratably over the respective customer contract term. As of 
December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue related to such customer payments 
amounted to $181 million and $191 million, respectively. Deferred revenue also 
includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility companies 
and various local and state government agencies, which is recognized as revenue 
over the lease term. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, deferred revenue from 
rebates and incentives was immaterial.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar 
energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, 
as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these 
costs over the term of the related agreements.

Cost of Revenues

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales

Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct and indirect materials, labor 
costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and 
machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, FSD 
Capability ongoing maintenance costs, allocations of electricity and 
infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for 
estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also includes 
adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying value of 
our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide 
for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally,
cost of automotive sales revenue benefits from manufacturing credits earned.

Automotive Leasing

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes the depreciation of operating lease 
vehicles, cost of goods sold associated with direct sales-type leases and 
warranty expense related to leased vehicles.

Services and Other

Costs of services and other revenue includes cost of used vehicles including 
refurbishment costs, costs associated with providing non-warranty after-sales 
services, costs associated with our body shops and part sales, costs of paid 
Supercharging, costs to provide vehicle insurance and costs for retail 
merchandise.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage

Cost of energy generation and storage revenue includes direct and indirect 
material and labor costs, overhead costs, freight, warranty expense, and 
amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. Cost of energy generation 
and storage revenue also includes charges to write down the carrying value of 
our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide 
for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand. Additionally,
cost of energy generation and storage revenue benefits from manufacturing 
credits earned. In agreements for solar energy systems and PPAs where we are the
lessor, the cost of revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost 
of leased solar energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems 
and amortization of any initial direct costs.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Income Taxes

We are subject to income taxes in the U. S. and in many foreign jurisdictions. 
Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all 
relevant factors at each reporting period. Significant judgment is required in 
determining our provision for income taxes, our deferred tax assets and 
liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax 
assets that are not more likely than not to be realized. In completing our 
assessment of realizability of our deferred tax assets, we consider our history 
of income (loss) measured at pre-tax income (loss) adjusted for permanent 
book-tax differences on a jurisdictional basis, volatility in actual earnings, 
excess tax benefits related to stock-based compensation in recent prior years, 
and impacts of the timing of reversal of existing temporary differences. We also
rely on our assessment of the Company’s projected future results of business 
operations, including uncertainty in future operating results relative to 
historical results, volatility in the market price of our common stock and its 
performance over time, variable macroeconomic conditions impacting our ability 
to forecast future taxable income, and changes in business that may affect the 
existence and magnitude of future taxable income. Our valuation allowance 
assessment is based on our best estimate of future results considering all 
available information.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act subjects a U. S. shareholder to tax on global 
intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. 
Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due 
on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into 
our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which 
we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities in our 
consolidated balance sheets.

Comprehensive Income

Comprehensive income is comprised of net income and other comprehensive income 
(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of foreign currency 
translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on investments that 
have been excluded from the determination of net income.

Stock-Based Compensation

We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and RSUs 
granted to employees and for our ESPP to measure the cost of employee services 
received in exchange for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option 
awards with only service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant
or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes
option-pricing model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, 
expected term and expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally
require significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant 
date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting 
cost is recognized over the period during which an employee is required to 
provide service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is
generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. 
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of 
actual forfeitures in the period.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable.

As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we
incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate 
significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially 
impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation 
expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation 
expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of 
operations.

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems 
and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual 
provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We 
have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling 
interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the 
substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the 
hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine
the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the 
HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as 
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests
in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling 
interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance 
sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at 
each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming 
the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined
in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date 
and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the 
results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the 
noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the 
consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, 
after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the 
third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at 
least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest 
balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the 
consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem 
their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there 
have been significant fluctuations in net (loss) income attributable to 
noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries
due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones have been 
reached.

Net Income per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net income per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders 
is calculated by dividing net income attributable to common stockholders by the 
weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the period. Potentially 
dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average shares of common stock 
underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and convertible senior notes
using the treasury stock method or the if-converted method, as applicable, are 
included when calculating diluted net income per share of common stock 
attributable to common stockholders when their effect is dilutive.

Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, 
we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 11, Debt). 
However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating 
potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The 
strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the 
period and were included in the tables below. Warrants are included in the 
weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income per share of common 
stock in the period(s) they are settled.

The following table presents the reconciliation of net income attributable to 
common stockholders to net income used in computing basic and diluted net income
per share of common stock (in millions):

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within Other income (expense), net, in the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents 
are primarily comprised of U. S. government securities, money market funds and 
commercial paper.

Restricted Cash

We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our 
restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain payments 
under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes 
cash held as collateral for sales to lease partners with a resale value 
guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases and deposits held for our 
insurance services. We record restricted cash as other assets in the 
consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current classification 
based on the expected duration of the restriction.

Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the 
consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):

Investments

Investments may be comprised of a combination of marketable securities, 
including U. S. government securities, corporate debt securities, commercial 
paper, time deposits, and certain certificates of deposit, which are all 
designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with 
unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income 
which is included within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale marketable 
securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are
included in short-term investments in our consolidated balance sheets. Interest,
dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on 
these investments are included within Interest income in our consolidated 
statements of operations.

The cost of available-for-sale investments sold is based on the specific 
identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of 
available-for-sale investments are recorded in Other income (expense), net.

We regularly review all of our investments for declines in fair value. The 
review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the 
decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the 
creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of
our investments approximates its fair value.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of 
regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and government rebates 
already passed through to customers. We provide an allowance against accounts 
receivable for the amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts 
receivable against the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.

Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our
accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer
payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from
our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on 
the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable 
balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits are dependent on 
contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can take up to a 
year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing timelines of 
the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may have a 
significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to period. As 
of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had $207 million and $753 million, 
respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current 
assets in our consolidated balance sheets.

Financing Receivables

We provide financing options to our customers for our automotive and energy 
products. Financing receivables are carried at amortized cost, net of allowance 
for loan losses. Provisions for loan losses are charged to operations in amounts
sufficient to maintain the allowance for loan losses at levels considered 
adequate to cover expected credit losses on the financing receivables. In 
determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit 
losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that 
affect the collectability of the future cash flows.

When originating consumer receivables, we review the credit application, the 
proposed contract terms, credit bureau information (e. g., FICO score) and other
information. Our evaluation emphasizes the applicant’s ability to pay and 
creditworthiness focusing on payment, affordability, and applicant credit 
history as key considerations. Generally, all customers in this portfolio have 
strong creditworthiness at loan origination.

After origination, we review the credit quality of retail financing based on 
customer payment activity and aging analysis. For all financing receivables, we 
define “past due” as any payment, including principal and interest, which is at 
least 31 days past the contractual due date. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
the vast majority of our financing receivables were at current status with only 
an immaterial balance being past due. As of December 31, 2023, the majority of 
our financing receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated 
in 2023 and 2022, and as of December 31, 2022, the majority of our financing 
receivables, excluding MyPower notes receivable, were originated in 2022.

We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which 
provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a 
solar energy system through a 30-year loan and were all originated prior to year
2018. The outstanding balances, net of any allowance for expected credit losses,
are presented on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of Prepaid 
expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as Other 
non-current assets for the long-term portion. As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of 
allowance for expected credit losses, was $266 million and $280 million, 
respectively, of which $5 million and $7 million were due in the next 12 months 
as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, respectively. As of December 31, 2023 and 
2022, the allowance for expected credit losses was $36 million and $37 million, 
respectively.

Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, investments, restricted cash, accounts 
receivable and other finance receivables. Our cash and investments balances are 
primarily on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions or invested 
in money market funds. These deposits are typically in excess of insured limits.
As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, no entity represented 10% or more of our total
receivables balance.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the 
inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in 
a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our 
inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition 
and operating results.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is 
computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy products, which 
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We record inventory 
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about 
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of 
our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the
net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us 
to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost
to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change 
in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial 
results.

Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are 
classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We
generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the 
straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual 
period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2023 and 
2022 was $7.36 billion and $6.08 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles
on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation
of $1.38 billion and $1.04 billion as of December 31, 2023 and 2022, 
respectively.

Digital Assets, Net

We currently account for all digital assets held as indefinite-lived intangible 
assets in accordance with ASC 350, Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. We have 
ownership of and control over our digital assets and we may use third-party 
custodial services to secure it. The digital assets are initially recorded at 
cost and are subsequently remeasured on the consolidated balance sheet at cost, 
net of any impairment losses incurred since acquisition.

We determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in 
accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement(“ASC 820”), based on quoted 
prices on the active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market
for such assets (Level I inputs). We perform an analysis each quarter to 
identify whether events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in 
the quoted prices on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not 
that our digital assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has 
occurred, we consider the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset 
quoted on the active exchange since acquiring the digital asset. When the then 
current carrying value of a digital asset exceeds the fair value determined each
quarter, an impairment loss has occurred with respect to those digital assets in
the amount equal to the difference between their carrying values and the prices 
determined.

Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the 
consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is 
identified. Gains are not recorded until realized upon sale(s), at which point 
they are presented net of any impairment losses for the same digital assets held
within Restructuring and other. In determining the gain to be recognized upon 
sale, we calculate the difference between the sales price and carrying value of 
the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.

See Note 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital 
assets.

Solar Energy Systems, Net

We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems in service                                               
30 to 35 years               
  Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease acquisition
costs      Lease term (up to 25 years)  

Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy
systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. 
Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under 
installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when 
they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs 
related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are 
capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.

Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are 
recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally 
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
respective assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office furniture      3 to 15 years   
  Tooling                                                  4 to 7 years    
  Building and building improvements                       15 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software                          3 to 10 years   

Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance 
sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement
of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified 
useful life.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in 
progress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized 
over the life of the related assets.

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term 
prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may
not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount 
to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If
the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its 
fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we have 
recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from seven

Goodwill

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. 
For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022, and 2021, we did not recognize any 
impairment of goodwill.

Capitalization of Software Costs

We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during
the application development stage to Property, plant and equipment, net on the 
consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and
post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are 
amortized on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful life of three

Software development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, 
leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of 
technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software 
are capitalized when they are expected to become significant. Such costs are 
amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is 
made generally available to our customers.

We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact 
the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022,
and 2021, we have recognized no impairments of capitalized software costs.

Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U. S. 
dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the 
different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet.
For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to 
its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to 
translate the balance sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency of the respective subsidiary. Transaction gains and losses 
are recognized in Other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of
operations. For the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, we recorded a 
net foreign currency transaction gain of $122 million, loss of $89 million and 
gain of $97 million, respectively.

Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and a warranty
on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems 
we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty 
reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the 
projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if 
identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an 
estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates 
are inherently uncertain and changes to our historical or projected warranty 
experience may cause material changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The
warranty reserve does not include projected warranty costs associated with our 
vehicles subject to operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems 
under lease contracts or PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are 
expensed as incurred. The portion of the warranty reserve expected to be 
incurred within the next 12 months is included within Accrued liabilities and 
other, while the remaining balance is included within Other long-term 
liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. For liabilities that we are 
entitled to receive indemnification from our suppliers, we record receivables 
for the contractually obligated amounts on the consolidated balance sheets as a 
component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion 
and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Warranty expense is 
recorded as a component of Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of 
operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive business, our accrued 
warranty balance is primarily related to our automotive segment. Accrued 
warranty activity consisted of the following (in millions):

Customer Deposits

Customer deposits primarily consist of refundable cash payments from customers 
at the time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy 
product and any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the 
completion of installation. Customer deposits also include prepayments on 
contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle 
maintenance plans. Customer deposits are included in Accrued liabilities and 
other on the consolidated balance sheets until refunded, forfeited or applied 
towards the customer’s purchase balance.

Government Assistance Programs and Incentives

Globally, the operation of our business is impacted by various government 
programs, incentives, and other arrangements. Government incentives are recorded
in our consolidated financial statements in accordance with their purpose as a 
reduction of expense, or an offset to the related capital asset. The benefit is 
generally recorded when all conditions attached to the incentive have been met 
or are expected to be met and there is reasonable assurance of their receipt.

The IRA Incentives

On August 16, 2022, the IRA was enacted into law and is effective for taxable 
years beginning after December 31, 2022. The IRA includes multiple incentives to
promote clean energy, electric vehicles, battery and energy storage manufacture 
or purchase, in addition to a new corporate alternative minimum tax of 15% on 
adjusted financial statement income of corporations with profits greater than $1
billion. Some of these measures are expected to materially affect our 
consolidated financial statements. For the year ended December 31, 2023, the 
impact from our IRA incentive was primarily a reduction of our material costs in
our consolidated statement of operations. We will continue to evaluate the 
effects of the IRA as more guidance is issued and the relevant implications to 
our consolidated financial statements.

Gigafactory New York - New York State Investment and Lease

We have a lease through the Research Foundation for the SUNY Foundation with 
respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a related research and 
development agreement, we are continuing to designate further buildouts at the 
facility. We are required to comply with certain covenants, including hiring and
cumulative investment targets. Under the terms of the arrangement, the SUNY 
Foundation paid for a majority of the construction costs related to the 
manufacturing facility and the acquisition and commissioning of certain 
manufacturing equipment; and we are responsible for any construction or 
equipment costs in excess of such amount (refer to Note 15, Commitments and 
Contingencies). This incentive reduces the related lease costs of the facility 
within the Energy generation and storage cost of revenues and operating expense 
line items in our consolidated statements of operations.

Gigafactory Shanghai - Land Use Rights and Economic Benefits

We have an agreement with the local government of Shanghai for land use rights 
at Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to 
meet a cumulative capital expenditure target and an annual tax revenue target 
starting at the end of 2023. In addition, the Shanghai government has granted to
our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary certain incentives to be used in connection 
with eligible capital investments at Gigafactory Shanghai (refer to Note 15, 
Commitments and Contingencies). For the year ended December 31, 2022, we 
received grant funding of $76 million. These incentives offset the related costs
of our facilities and are recorded as a reduction of the cost of the capital 
investment within the Property, plant and equipment, net line item in our 
consolidated balance sheets. The incentive therefore reduces the depreciation 
expense over the useful lives of the related equipment.

Nevada Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into 
agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide 
abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and 
transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital 
investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada.

Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into a 
20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would receive
grant funding equal to 70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis County and 
a separate 10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School District in 
Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our property would be 
capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our meeting certain 
minimum economic development metrics through our construction and operations at 
Gigafactory Texas. This incentive is recorded as a reduction of the related 
expenses within the Cost of automotive revenues and operating expense line items
of our consolidated statements of operations. As of December 31, 2023, the grant
funding related to property taxes paid were immaterial.

Defined Contribution Plan

We have a 401(k) savings plan in the U. S. that is intended to qualify as a 
deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code 
and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, 
participating employees may elect to contribute up to 90% of their eligible 
compensation, subject to certain limitations. Beginning in January 2022, we 
began to match 50% of each employee’s contributions up to a maximum of 6% 
(capped at $3,000) of the employee’s eligible compensation, vested upon one year
of service. During the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recognized $99
million and $91 million, respectively, of expenses related to employer 
contributions for the 401(k) savings plan.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In November 2023, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“FASB”) issued ASU 
No. 2023-07, Improvements to Reportable Segment Disclosures (Topic 280). This 
ASU updates reportable segment disclosure requirements by requiring disclosures 
of significant reportable segment expenses that are regularly provided to the 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (“CODM”) and included within each reported 
measure of a segment's profit or loss. This ASU also requires disclosure of the 
title and position of the individual identified as the CODM and an explanation 
of how the CODM uses the reported measures of a segment’s profit or loss in 
assessing segment performance and deciding how to allocate resources. The ASU is
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2023, and interim 
periods within fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2024. Adoption of the 
ASU should be applied retrospectively to all prior periods presented in the 
financial statements. Early adoption is also permitted. This ASU will likely 
result in us including the additional required disclosures when adopted. We are 
currently evaluating the provisions of this ASU and expect to adopt them for the
year ending December 31, 2024.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-08, Accounting for and Disclosure
of Crypto Assets (Subtopic 350-60). This ASU requires certain crypto assets to 
be measured at fair value separately in the balance sheet and income statement 
each reporting period. This ASU also enhances the other intangible asset 
disclosure requirements by requiring the name, cost basis, fair value, and 
number of units for each significant crypto holding. The ASU is effective for 
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024, including interim periods 
within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU requires a cumulative-effect 
adjustment to the opening balance of retained earnings as of the beginning of 
the annual reporting period in which an entity adopts the amendments. Early 
adoption is also permitted, including adoption in an interim period. However, if
the ASU is early adopted in an interim period, an entity must adopt the ASU as 
of the beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. This ASU 
will result in gains and losses recorded in the consolidated financial 
statements of operations and additional disclosures when adopted. We are 
currently evaluating the adoption of this ASU and it will affect the carrying 
value of our crypto assets held and the gains and losses relating thereto, once 
adopted.

In December 2023, the FASB issued ASU No. 2023-09, Improvements to Income Tax 
Disclosures (Topic 740). The ASU requires disaggregated information about a 
reporting entity’s effective tax rate reconciliation as well as additional 
information on income taxes paid. The ASU is effective on a prospective basis 
for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2024. Early adoption is also 
permitted for annual financial statements that have not yet been issued or made 
available for issuance. This ASU will result in the required additional 
disclosures being included in our consolidated financial statements, once 
adopted.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets
and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU 
requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract
assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using
the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the 
acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired 
contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 
2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We adopted this ASU 
prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is currently not expected
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In March 2022, the FASB issued ASU 2022-02, Troubled Debt Restructurings and 
Vintage Disclosures. This ASU eliminates the accounting guidance for troubled 
debt restructurings by creditors that have adopted ASU 2016-13, Measurement of 
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments, which we adopted on January 1, 2020. 
This ASU also enhances the disclosure requirements for certain loan refinancing 
and restructurings by creditors when a borrower is experiencing financial 
difficulty. In addition, the ASU amends the guidance on vintage disclosures to 
require entities to disclose current period gross write-offs by year of 
origination for financing receivables and net investments in leases within the 
scope of ASC 326-20. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after 
December 15, 2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. We 
adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2023. This ASU has not and is 
currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements.

ASU 2020-06

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible 
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the 
accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in 
ASC 470-20, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible 
instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion 
features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 
815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums 
accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer 
required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt 
instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized 
cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible 
debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when 
applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments 
to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most 
significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for 
diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method.
The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an 
entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from 
derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of 
contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities.

On January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. 
We recognized a favorable $211 million cumulative effect of initially applying 
the ASU as an adjustment to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated 
deficit. Due to the recombination of the equity conversion component of our 
convertible debt remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital was reduced 
by $474 million and convertible senior notes (mezzanine equity) was reduced by 
$51 million. The removal of the remaining debt discounts recorded for this 
previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt balance by $269 
million and we reduced property, plant and equipment by $45 million related to 
previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial 
statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported 
under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.
