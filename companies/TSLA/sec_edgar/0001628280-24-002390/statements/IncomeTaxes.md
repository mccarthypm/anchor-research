We monitor the realizability of our deferred tax assets taking into account all 
relevant factors at each reporting period. As of December 31, 2023, based on the
relevant weight of positive and negative evidence, including the amount of our 
taxable income in recent years which is objective and verifiable, and 
consideration of our expected future taxable earnings, we concluded that it is 
more likely than not that our U. S. federal and certain state deferred tax 
assets are realizable. As such, we released $6.54 billion of our valuation 
allowance associated with the U. S. federal and state deferred tax assets, with 
the exception of our California deferred tax assets. We continue to maintain a 
full valuation allowance against our California deferred tax assets as of 
December 31, 2023, because we concluded they are not more likely than not to be 
realized as we expect our California deferred tax assets generation in future 
years to exceed our ability to use these deferred tax assets.

As of December 31, 2023, we maintained valuation allowances of $892 million for 
deferred tax assets that are not more likely than not to be realized, which 
primarily included deferred tax assets in the state of California and certain 
foreign operating losses. The valuation allowance on our net deferred tax assets
decreased by $6.46 billion and $1.73 billion during the years ended December 31,
2023 and 2022, respectively, and increased by $6.14 billion during the year 
ended December 31, 2021. The valuation allowance decrease during the year ended 
December 31, 2023 was primarily due to the release of our valuation allowance 
with respect to our U. S. federal and certain state deferred tax assets. The 
changes in valuation allowances during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 
2021 were primarily due to changes in our U. S. deferred tax assets and 
liabilities in the respective year. Among our deferred tax assets in foreign 
jurisdictions, we recorded a valuation allowance on certain foreign net 
operating losses that are not more likely than not to be realized. The remainder
of our foreign deferred tax assets are more likely than not to be realized given
the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2023, we had $10.31 billion of federal and $10.36 billion of 
state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable 
income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2024 for federal
and state purposes. Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions 
on the utilization of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the 
event of an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal 
Revenue Code. We have determined that no significant limitation would be placed 
on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due 
to prior ownership changes or expirations.

As of December 31, 2023, we had federal research and development tax credits of 
$1.10 billion, federal renewable energy tax credits of $605 million, and state 
research and development tax credits of $923 million. Most of our state research
and development tax credits were in the state of California. If not utilized, 
some of the federal tax credits may expire in various amounts beginning in 2036.
However, California research and development tax credits can be carried forward 
indefinitely.

The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate 
of 15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the 25% statutory corporate 
income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this 
beneficial income tax rate of 15% for 2019 through 2023. Starting in 2024, 
Gigafactory Shanghai is subject to 25% statutory corporate income tax rate in 
China.

As of December 31, 2023, we intend to indefinitely reinvest our foreign earnings
and cash unless such repatriation results in no or minimal tax costs. We have 
recorded the taxes associated with the foreign earnings we intend to repatriate 
in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, no deferred 
tax liabilities for foreign withholding or other taxes have been recorded. The 
estimated amount of such unrecognized withholding tax liability associated with 
the indefinitely reinvested earnings is approximately $245 million.

We include interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits in income
tax expense. We recognized net interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits in provision for income taxes line of our consolidated statements 
of operations of $17 million, $27 million and $4 million for the years ended 
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, and 
2022, we have accrued $47 million and $31 million, respectively, related to 
interest and penalties on our unrecognized tax benefits. Unrecognized tax 
benefits of $901 million, if recognized, would affect our effective tax rate.

We file income tax returns in the U. S. and various state and foreign 
jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the Internal Revenue 
Service (“IRS”) for the years 2015 to 2018. Additional tax years within the 
periods 2004 to 2014 and 2019 to 2022 remain subject to examination for federal 
income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date 
are subject to adjustment for U. S. federal and state income tax purposes. Our 
returns for 2004 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in U. S.
state and foreign jurisdictions.

Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate
of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax 
benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.
