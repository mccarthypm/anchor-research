In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 
2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock
appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, 
directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be 
either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock 
options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be 
granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock 
options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over
a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically 
terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends.

As of December 31, 2023, 131.1 million shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2019 Plan.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year 
ended December 31, 2023:

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended 
December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was $228.33, $239.85 and $261.33, respectively.
The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 
2023, 2022 and 2021 was $2.50 billion, $4.32 billion and $5.70 billion, 
respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 
31, 2023, 2022, and 2021 was $1.33 billion, $1.90 billion and $26.88 billion, 
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO exercised all of 
the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, which amounted
to an intrinsic value of $23.45 billion.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, under the ESPP we 
issued 2.1 million, 1.4 million and 1.5 million shares, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2023, there were 97.8 million shares available for issuance under 
the ESPP.

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the 
grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The 
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options 
are as follows:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is 
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common 
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield for 
zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s 
expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our
employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied 
volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical 
volatility of our common stock.

2018 CEO Performance Award

In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 304.0 
million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 Stock Split 
and the 2022 Stock Split, to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 
2018 CEO Performance Award consisted of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting 
schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones 
(performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment 
either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and 
service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 
CEO Performance Award vested upon certification by the Board of Directors that 
both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which began at 
$100.0 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50.0 
billion thereafter (based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30
calendar day trailing average, counting only trading days), had been achieved, 
and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total 
revenue or any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted 
EBITDA had been achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an 
annualized basis and subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial 
statements filed with our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA was defined as
net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, 
provision (benefit) for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and 
stock-based compensation. Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of 
the exercise price of $23.34 per share as adjusted to give effect to the 2020 
Stock Split and the 2022 Stock Split, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires 
for five years post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are 
simultaneously sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax 
withholding.

The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2023 is 
provided below.

Stock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represented a 
non-cash expense and was recorded as a Selling, general, and administrative 
operating expense in our consolidated statements of operations. In each quarter 
since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we had recognized expense, 
generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the 
maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponded to the number of operational 
milestones that had been achieved or had been determined probable of being 
achieved in the future, in accordance with the following principles.

On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each 
tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time 
when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be 
achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.” 
Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial performance
each quarter, we determined whether it was probable that we would achieve each 
operational milestone that had not previously been achieved or deemed probable 
of achievement and if so, the future time when we expected to achieve that 
operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone achievement time.”

As of December 31, 2022, all remaining unrecognized stock-based compensation 
expense under the 2018 CEO Performance Award had been recognized. For the years 
ended December 31, 2022 and 2021, we recorded stock-based compensation expense 
of $66 million and $910 million, respectively, related to the 2018 CEO 
Performance Award.

Other Performance-Based Grants

From time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants 
certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.

As of December 31, 2023, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of
$655 million under these grants to purchase or receive an aggregate 5.3 million 
shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the 
unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $110 million will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.

For the years ended December 31, 2023 and 2022, we recorded $57 million and $159
million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to these 
grants, net of forfeitures.

Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements 
were immaterial while we were under full valuation allowances on our U. S. 
deferred tax assets during the years ended December 31, 2022 and 2021. With the 
release of the valuation allowance associated with our federal and certain state
deferred tax assets in 2023, income tax benefits recognized from stock-based 
compensation expense were $326 million during the year ended December 31, 2023. 
During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021, stock-based 
compensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance sheets was $199 
million, $245 million and $182 million, respectively. As of December 31, 2023, 
we had $4.82 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation expense 
related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a 
weighted-average period of 2.8 years.
