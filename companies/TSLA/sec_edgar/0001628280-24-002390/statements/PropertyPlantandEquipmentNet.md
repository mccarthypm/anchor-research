Construction in progress is primarily comprised of ongoing construction and 
expansion of our facilities, and equipment and tooling related to the 
manufacturing of our products. Completed assets are transferred to their 
respective asset classes and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its 
intended use.

Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 was
$3.33 billion, $2.42 billion and $1.91 billion, respectively.

Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the 
production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery 
cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output
from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the 
arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, we account for their 
production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for 
each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single 
lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes 
embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their 
production equipment within Property, plant and equipment, net, on the 
consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and 
finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed using
the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the 
total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 
2023 and 2022, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of $2.02 billion and 
$2.01 billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to 
the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.
