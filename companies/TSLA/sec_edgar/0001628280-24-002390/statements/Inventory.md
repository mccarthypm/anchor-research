We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we 
believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying 
value. During the years ended December 31, 2023, 2022 and 2021 we recorded 
write-downs of $233 million, $144 million and $106 million, respectively, in 
Cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
