In relation to our CEO’s exercise of stock options and sale of common stock from
the 2012 CEO Performance Award, Tesla withheld the appropriate amount of taxes. 
However, given the significant amounts involved, our CEO entered into an 
indemnification agreement with us in November 2021 for additional taxes owed, if
any.

Tesla periodically does business with certain entities with which its CEO and 
directors are affiliated, such as SpaceX and X Corp., in accordance with our 
Related Person Transactions Policy. Such transactions have not had to date, and 
are not currently expected to have, a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements.
