(1) There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes
with respect to any available committed funds under our RCF Credit Agreement, 
except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down. Refer to the section 
below for the terms of the facility.

(2) There were no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate 
purposes with respect to any available committed funds under our credit 
facilities, except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including 
pledging to our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, 
inventories, leased vehicles and our interests in those leases or various other 
assets as described below.

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our 
subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net 
carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As of 
December 31, 2023, we were in material compliance with all financial debt 
covenants.

2024 Notes

The closing price of our common stock continued to exceed 130% of the applicable
conversion price of our 2024 Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive 
trading days of each quarter in 2023, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible 
by their holders in the subsequent quarter. As of December 31, 2023, the 
if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by $406
million. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our 
common stock or a combination thereof, at our election.

Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement 
(as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of 
banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% 
plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the
lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 
0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts 
receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is 
based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.

In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit 
facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks to replace the 
existing Credit Agreement, which was terminated. The RCF Credit Agreement 
contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment of up to 
$5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under certain 
circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general corporate 
purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: (i) for 
dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the forward-looking 
secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an alternate base rate; 
(ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the sterling overnight 
index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated in euros, an 
adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus an applicable
margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned to our 
senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time to 
time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and is 
currently 0.125% per annum.

Automotive Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related 
to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose entities 
(“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive 
assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The 
cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the 
principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy
the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the 
SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease or 
financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’
assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the 
creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have 
no recourse to our other assets.

In 2023, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles 
and financing receivables into SPEs and issued $3.93 billion in aggregate 
principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our 
other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the 
issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $3.92 billion.

Cash Equity Debt

In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our 
subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that 
bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our 
interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

Automotive Lease-backed Credit Facilities

In the third quarter of 2023, we terminated our Automotive Lease-backed Credit 
Facilities and the previously committed funds are no longer available for future
borrowings.

Pledged Assets

As of December 31, 2023 and 2022, we had pledged or restricted $4.64 billion and
$2.02 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating lease vehicles,
financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as
collateral for our outstanding debt.
