We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy 
generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development,
manufacturing, sales and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of 
automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also 
comprised of services and other, which includes sales of used vehicles, 
non-warranty after-sales vehicle services, body shop and parts, paid 
Supercharging, vehicle insurance revenue and retail merchandise. The energy 
generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, 
sales and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and 
related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our CODM does not
evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information. The following 
table presents revenues and gross profit by reportable segment (in millions):
