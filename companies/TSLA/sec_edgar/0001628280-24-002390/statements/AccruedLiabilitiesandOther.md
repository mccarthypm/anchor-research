(1) Accrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services for 
which we had not yet been invoiced. As we are invoiced for these goods and 
services, this balance will reduce and accounts payable will increase.

(2) Taxes payable includes value added tax, income tax, sales tax, property tax 
and use tax payables.
