The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and its 
wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company transactions and 
balances have been eliminated in consolidation.

During the year ended December 31, 2014, we began separately presenting the 
effect of exchange rate changes on our cash and cash equivalents in our 
consolidated statements of cash flows due to our growing operations in foreign 
currency environments. Prior period amounts have been reclassified to conform to
the current period presentation.

|   Use of Estimates | Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the 
financial statements, and reported amounts of expenses during the reporting 
period, including revenue recognition, residual value of operating lease 
vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments, 
valuation allowances for deferred tax assets, uncertain tax positions, and 
stock-based compensation. Given the inherent uncertainty of these estimates, 
actual results could differ from those estimates.

| **  Recent Accounting Pronouncements** | Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting 
update which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. 
The new guidance provides a unified model to determine when and how revenue is 
recognized. Under the new model, revenue is recognized as goods or services are 
delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to collect. The
guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15, 2016; early 
adoption is prohibited. The new standard is required to be applied 
retrospectively to each prior reporting period presented or retrospectively with
the cumulative effect of initially applying it recognized at the date of initial
application. We have not yet selected a transition method and are currently 
evaluating the impact of adopting this guidance on our consolidated financial 
statements.

| **  Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including 
vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of regulatory 
credits, such as zero emission vehicle (ZEV), greenhouse gas emission (GHG) 
credits, and CAFE credits, as well as sales of electric vehicle powertrain 
components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units and sales of 
services related to the development of these systems. We recognize revenue when:
(i) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and
there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed 
or determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.

For multiple deliverable revenue arrangements, we allocate revenue to each 
element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a deliverable 
is based on its vendor specific objective evidence (VSOE) if available, third 
party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not available, or estimated selling price if 
neither VSOE nor TPE is available.

Automotive Sales

We recognize automotive sales revenue from sales of Model S, including vehicle 
options, accessories and destination charges, vehicle service. We also recognize
automotive sales revenue from the sales of electric vehicle powertrain 
components and systems, such as battery packs and drive units, to other 
manufacturers. Revenue is recognized when (i) persuasive evidence of an 
arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no uncertainties 
regarding customer acceptance; (iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) 
collection is reasonably assured.

Car sales include certain standard features and customer selected options and 
configurations that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element 
accounting guidance, including internet connectivity, Supercharging access, and 
specified software updates for cars equipped with Autopilot hardware. These 
deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we recognize their related 
revenue over our performance period which is generally the eight-year life of 
the car or, for software upgrades, as they are delivered. If we sell a derivable
separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use 
our best estimated selling price by considering third party pricing of similar 
options, costs used to develop and deliver the service, and other information 
which may be available.

As of December 31, 2014, we had deferred $25.6 million related to access to our 
Supercharger network and $14.4 million related to connectivity.

At the time of revenue recognition, we record a reserve against revenue for 
estimated future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical 
experience and are immaterial in all periods presented.

Resale Value Guarantee

We offer a resale value guarantee program to customers who purchase a Model S 
and finance their vehicle through one of our commercial banking partners in the 
US, Canada and Europe. Under this program, Model S customers have the option of 
selling their vehicle back to us during the period from 36 to 39 months after 
delivery for a specified value determined at time of purchase. Because we offer 
a resale value guarantee, we account for these transactions as operating leases.
Accordingly, we recognize revenue attributable to the lease on a straight-line 
basis over the guarantee period to automotive sales revenue. Similarly, we 
capitalize the cost of the leased vehicle and depreciate its value, less 
expected salvage value, to cost of automotive sales over the same period.

At the end of the guarantee period, which is the earlier of 39 months or the 
pay-off date of the initial loan, the resale value guarantee and deferred 
revenue balances are settled to automotive sales revenue and the net book value 
of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of automotive sales if our customer 
retains ownership of the car. In cases where a customer returns the vehicle back
to us between months 36 and 39, we issue a check to the customer in the amount 
of the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred revenue balance 
to automotive sales revenue.

At least annually, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our 
resale value guarantee program. As we accumulate more data related to the resale
values of Model S, there may be significant changes to their estimated values.

Beginning in 2014, Tesla began offering resale value guarantees in connection 
with automobile sales to certain financing institutions. As Tesla has guaranteed
the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are expected to be leased to 
end-customers, we account for them as collateralized borrowings. At December 31,
2014, we have $19.6 million of such borrowings recorded in resale value 
guarantee liability of which a portion will be accreted to revenue and a portion
may be distributed to the financing institutions should we decide to repurchase 
the vehicles at the end of the term or should the financing institution sell the
car to a third party and receive proceeds less than the value we have 
guaranteed. The maximum cash payment to re-purchase these vehicles under these 
arrangements at December 31, 2014, is $11.2 million. Cash received upon the sale
of such cars is classified as collateralized lease borrowing within cash flows 
from financing activities in our Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows.

Account activity related to our resale value guarantee program consisted of the 
following for the period presented (in thousands):

Model S Leasing Program

In April 2014, we began offering a leasing program in the United States and 
Canada for Model S. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a Model S for 36
months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to
us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these 
leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing 
revenues over the contractual term of the individual leases and depreciate the 
cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to 
cost of automotive sales over the same period. As of December 31, 2014, we had 
deferred $9.4 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized
on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. 
Lease revenues are recorded in automotive sales and for the year ended December 
31, 2014, we recognized $4.4 million.

Regulatory Credits Sales

California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle 
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in 
that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. These laws and 
regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn 
regulatory credits, and may sell excess credits to other manufacturers who apply
such credits to comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations 
exist at the federal level that require compliance related to GHG emissions and 
also allow for the sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other 
manufacturers. As a manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we have 
earned emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG credits on vehicles, and we expect 
to continue to earn these credits in the future. We enter into contractual 
agreements with third parties to purchase our regulatory credits.

We recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the
credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Revenue from the sale of 
regulatory credits totaled $216.3 million, $194.4 million, and $40.5 million for
the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Maintenance and Service Plans

We offer a prepaid maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans 
covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles, provided 
these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance 
plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts, 
excluding tires and the battery, with either a fixed fee per visit for Tesla 
Ranger service or unlimited Tesla Ranger visits for a higher initial purchase 
price. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service are initially
recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized 
in automotive sales as we fulfill our performance obligations.

We also offer an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement 
of Model S parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 
miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty, provided they 
are purchased within a specified period of time. For customers that are not 
covered by our New Vehicle Limited Warranties or our extended service plans, we 
offer Tesla Ranger service at a higher cost. Payments collected in advance of 
the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the 
consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the 
service coverage periods.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had deferred $39.7 million and $24.9 
million, respectively, related to our maintenance and service plans. During the 
years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recognized revenue of $3.0 million 
and $0.6 million related to these plans, respectively.

We provided Tesla Roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an 
extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial New Vehicle 
Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional three years or 
36,000 miles. We refer to this program as our Extended Service plan. Amounts 
collected on these sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the 
consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales over the extended
warranty period. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had deferred $0.7 million 
and $1.4 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 
2013, we recognized revenue of $0.5 million and $0.4 million related to this 
program, respectively.

Additionally, we have previously provided customers of our Tesla Roadsters with 
a one-time option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at any time 
after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty but before the tenth 
anniversary of the purchase date of their vehicles. We refer to this program as 
our Battery Replacement program. Amounts collected on these sales are initially 
recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized 
in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the battery packs. 
As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we had deferred $1.3 million and $1.3 million,
respectively, related to the Battery Replacement program and have not yet 
recognized any related revenues.

Development Services Revenue

Revenue from development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from 
the development of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems for other 
automobile manufacturers, including the design and development of battery packs,
drive units and sample vehicles to meet a customer’s specifications. Revenue is 
recognized as the performance requirements of each development arrangement are 
met and collection is reasonably assured. Where development arrangements include
substantive at- risk milestones, revenue is recognized based upon the 
achievement of the contractually-defined milestones. Amounts collected in 
advance of meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in
the consolidated statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred 
revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs of development services are 
expensed as incurred. When development services arrangements have multiple 
elements, we evaluate the separability of the various deliverables to ensure 
appropriate revenue recognition. Costs of development services incurred in 
periods prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research and 
development expenses; once an agreement is finalized, these costs are recorded 
in cost of revenues.

| **  Cash and Cash Equivalents** | Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. We currently 
invest excess cash primarily in money market funds.
 |  |  |
|   Marketable Securities | Marketable Securities

Marketable securities have historically been comprised of commercial paper and 
corporate debt and are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at 
estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated 
other comprehensive loss which is included within stockholders’ equity. Realized
gains and losses on the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are 
recorded in other income (expense), net. The cost of available-for-sale 
marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification method. 
Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and 
discounts on our marketable securities are included in other income (expense), 
net. Available-for-sale marketable securities with maturities greater than three
months at the date of purchase and remaining maturities of one year or less are 
classified as short-term marketable securities. Where temporary declines in fair
value exist, we have the ability and the intent to hold these securities for a 
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

When held, we regularly review all of our marketable securities for 
other-than-temporary declines in fair value. The review includes but is not 
limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the impairment, (ii) the 
creditworthiness of the security issuers, (iii) the length of time a security is
in an unrealized loss position, and (iv) our ability to hold the security for a 
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
 |  |  |
|   Restricted Cash and Deposits | Restricted Cash and Deposits

We maintain certain cash amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. We 
maintained total restricted cash of $29.3 million and $9.4 million as of 
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. Current and noncurrent restricted cash
as of December 31, 2013 was comprised primarily of security deposits held by 
vendors as part of the vendors’ standard credit policies, security deposits 
related to lease agreements and equipment financing, and certain refundable 
customer deposits segregated in accordance with state consumer protection 
regulations.
 |  |  |
| **  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts** | Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain 
systems, receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering 
various financing products to our customers, and regulatory credits to other 
automotive manufacturers (OEMs). In circumstances where we are aware of a 
specific customer’s inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we 
provide an allowance against amounts receivable to reduce the net recognized 
receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected.

We typically do not carry accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related
sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery, except for the 
amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing 
arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions.
 |  |  |
| **  Concentration of Risk** | Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable.
Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high 
credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these 
deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. We invest cash not 
required for use in operations in high credit quality securities based on our 
investment policy. Our investment policy provides guidelines and limits 
regarding credit quality, investment concentration, investment type, and 
maturity that we believe will provide liquidity while reducing risk of loss of 
capital. Our investments are currently of a short-term nature and include 
commercial paper and U. S. treasury bills.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, our accounts receivable were derived primarily
from sales of regulatory credits, as well as funds to be received from financial
institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our 
customers, the development and sales of powertrain components and systems to 
OEMs. Accounts receivable also included amounts to be received from commercial 
financial institutions for approved financing arrangements between our customers
and financial institutions.

The following summarizes the accounts receivable from our OEM customers in 
excess of 10% of our total accounts receivable:

                  December 31,              December 31,          
                          2014              2013                  
  Customer A                        19      —                     
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Customer B                        14                        30  
  Customer C                        13                         4  

Supply Risk

Although there may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used 
in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these single source
suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive 
prices, we could suffer manufacturing delays, a possible loss of revenues, or 
incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our operating 
results.
 |  |  |
| **  Inventories and Inventory Valuation** | Inventories and Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using 
standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We
record inventory write-downs based on reviews for excess and obsolescence 
determined primarily by future demand forecasts. We also adjust the carrying 
value of our inventories when we believe that the net realizable value is less 
than the carrying value. These write-downs are measured as the difference 
between the cost of the inventory, including estimated costs to complete, and 
estimated selling prices. Once inventory is written down, a new, lower-cost 
basis for that inventory is established, and subsequent changes in facts and 
circumstances do not result in the restoration or increase in that newly 
established cost basis.
 |  |  |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

  Machinery, equipment and office furniture      3 to 12 years  
  Building and building improvements             30 years       
  Computer equipment and software                3 years        

Depreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method 
whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life
of the related assets. As of December 31, 2014, the estimated productive life 
for tooling was 200,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production.

Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the 
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repair 
expenditures are expensed as incurred, while major improvements that increase 
functionality of the asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense 
over the identified useful life. Land is not depreciated.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in 
progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is amortized over the
life of the related assets.
 |  |  |
| **  Operating Lease Vehicles** | Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles delivered under our resale value guarantee program, vehicles that are 
leased as part of our leasing program as well as any vehicles that are sold with
a significant buy-back guarantee are classified as operating lease vehicles as 
the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases. Operating 
lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation 
is computed using the straight-line method over the expected operating lease 
term. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded in the consolidated 
balance sheets as of December 31, 2014 and 2013 was $849.8 million and $401.9 
million. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31, 
2014 and 2013 was $83.1 million and $19.5 million.
 |  |  |
| **  Long-lived Assets** | Long-lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for indicators 
of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Impairment 
exists if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Should 
impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess 
carrying value of the asset over the asset’s estimated fair value. As of 
December 31, 2014 and 2013, we did not record any material impairment losses on 
our long-lived assets.
 |  |  |
|   Research and Development Costs | Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and 
development expenses consist primarily of payroll, benefits and stock-based 
compensation of those employees engaged in research, design and development 
activities, costs related to design tools, license expenses related to 
intellectual property, supplies and services, depreciation and other occupancy 
costs.
 |  |  |
| **  Advertising and Promotion Costs** | Advertising and Promotion Costs

Advertising and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years
ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, advertising, promotion and related 
marketing expenses were $48.9 million, $9.0 million and $3.9 million, 
respectively.
 |  |  |
| **  Shipping and Handling Costs** | Shipping and Handling Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as 
revenue, and related shipping and handling costs are included in cost of 
revenues.
 |  |  |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.
 |  |  |
|   Stock-based Compensation | Stock-based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and our employee stock 
purchase plan (the ESPP). The fair value of stock options and the ESPP are 
estimated on the grant date and offering date using an option pricing model, 
respectively. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the 
closing fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of
estimated forfeitures.

We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair 
value of the awards. The fair value of the awards granted to non-employees is 
re-measured as the awards vest and the resulting change in fair value, if any, 
is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the period the
related services are rendered.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable.

For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of both performance and market conditions, the stock-based 
compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market 
conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance
and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant 
performance condition is considered probable of being met (see Note 8).

| **  Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Transactions** | Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Transactions

For each of our foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency is the U. S. 
dollar. For these foreign subsidiaries, monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in non-U. S. currencies are re-measured to U. S. dollars using 
current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets 
and liabilities denominated in non-U. S. currencies are maintained at historical
U. S. dollar exchange rates. Revenues and expenses are re-measured at average U.
S. dollar monthly rates.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended
December 31, 2014 and 2013, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of 
$2.0 million and $11.9 million, respectively. For the year ended December 2012, 
transaction gains and losses were not significant.

Beginning January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign 
subsidiaries changed to their local country’s currency. This change was based on
the culmination of facts and circumstances that have developed as we expanded 
our foreign operations over the past year. The adjustment attributable to the 
current rate translation of non-monetary assets as of the date of the change 
will be included in accumulated other comprehensive income in the Company’s 
quarterly report on Form 10-Q for the period ending March 31, 2015.

| **  Comprehensive Loss** | Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income 
(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized gains and 
losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities that have been excluded 
from the determination of net loss.

|   Warranties | Warranties

We provide a warranty on all vehicle, production powertrain components and 
systems sales, and we accrue warranty reserves at the time a vehicle or 
production powertrain component or system is delivered to the customer. Warranty
reserves include management’s best estimate of the projected costs to repair or 
to replace any items under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it 
becomes available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of 
historical data. For new vehicles, warranty reserves are based on management’s 
best estimate of projected warranty experience until adequate historical data is
accumulated. Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs 
associated with our resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty 
costs are expensed as incurred. For the year ended December 31, 2014, warranty 
costs incurred for our resale value guarantee vehicles was $6.9 million. We may 
have material changes as we accumulate more actual data and experience. We 
review our reserves at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate 
in meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust our 
estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of 
revenues in the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of the 
warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12 months from the 
balance sheet date is classified as current, while the remaining amount is 
classified as long-term.

We began recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster 
sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a warranty of three 
years or 36,000 miles, which we extended to four years or 50,000 miles for the 
purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Tesla Roadster customers had the 
opportunity to purchase an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of
the New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional 
three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a specified 
period of time.

In June 2012, we commenced deliveries of Model S. For our Model S customers, we 
provide a four year or 50,000 miles New Vehicle Limited Warranty, subject to 
separate limited warranties for the supplemental restraint system and battery. 
During the third quarter of 2014, we extended the warranty on our Model S drive 
unit to eight years from four. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty also covers the 
battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or unlimited miles, 
depending on the size of the vehicle’s battery, although the battery’s charging 
capacity is not covered. Model S customers also have the opportunity to purchase
an Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle Limited
Warranty to cover additional services for an additional four years or 50,000 
miles, provided they are purchased within a specified period of time. The 
battery pack’s charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited 
Warranty or any Extended Service plan.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the current portion of our accrued warranty was
$32.3 million and $19.9 million, which was recorded in accrued liabilities in 
our Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013 the 
non-current portion of our accrued warranty was $96.7 million and $33.3 million,
which was recorded in other long-term liabilities in our Consolidated Balance 
Sheets.

|   Environmental Liabilities | Environmental Liabilities

We are subject to federal and state laws and regulations for the protection of 
the environment, including those related to the discharge of hazardous materials
and remediation of contaminated sites. We accrue for environmental liabilities 
in the period in which it is probable a liability exists and the amount of such 
loss can be reasonably estimated. We assess adequacy of our accrued liabilities 
for remediation of any environmental contamination at least quarterly and adjust
our estimates as appropriate. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we accrued $4.0 
million and $5.5 million related to environmental liabilities (see Note 11).

| **  Net Loss per Share of Common Stock** | Net Loss per Share of Common Stock

Our basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock is calculated by 
dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for
the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the number of shares
underlying outstanding stock options and warrants as well as our Notes, are not 
included when their effect is antidilutive.

The following table presents the potential weighted common shares outstanding 
that were excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share 
of common stock for the periods, related to the following securities:

Since we expect to settle the principal amount of our outstanding convertible 
senior notes in cash, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any 
potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per 
share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on 
diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of 
our common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $124.52, 
$359.87, and $359.87 per share for the convertible senior notes due 2018 Notes, 
2019 Notes and 2021 Notes, respectively.

| **  Fair Value Measurement** | The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, 
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate 
their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the 
fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier
fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
(Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are 
observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in
which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own 
assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when 
available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair 
value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our restricted short-term
marketable securities are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy.

All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised 
primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value
hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices 
for similar securities.
