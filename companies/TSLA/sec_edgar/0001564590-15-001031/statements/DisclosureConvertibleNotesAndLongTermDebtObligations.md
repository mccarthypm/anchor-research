0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions

In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible 
senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% 
convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 
2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 
Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to 
the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our 
March 2014 public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after 
deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes 
and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes, respectively. We incurred $14.2 million and 
$21.4 million, respectively, of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 
Notes and the 2021 Notes, which we initially recorded in other assets and are 
amortizing to interest expense using the effective interest method over the 
contractual terms of these notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 
1.25% per annum and are payable semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and 
September 1 of each year, commencing on September 1, 2014. During the year ended
December 31, 2014, we recognized $3.2 million of interest expense, related to 
the amortization of debt issuance costs and $16.2 million of accrued coupon 
interest expense.

Each $1,000 of principal of these notes will initially be convertible into 
2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion 
price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the 
occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes may convert their Notes 
at their option on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after 
December 1, 2020 for the 2021 Notes. Further, holders of these notes may convert
their notes at their option prior to the respective dates above, only under the 
following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the 
fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2014, if the last reported sale price of our 
common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during 
the last 30 consecutive trading days of immediately preceding fiscal quarter is 
greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the applicable notes on
each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following 
any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 
applicable notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of 
our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we 
make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified 
corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or
deliver as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash
and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon conversion of the 2021 
Notes, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount and, if 
applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in 
lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily 
conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, 
holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 
notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 
the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific 
corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we will increase 
the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection
with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. During the fourth quarter 
of 2014, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of 
the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 
of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other 
conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of 
December 31, 2014. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible 
during the first quarter of 2015 and are classified as long-term debt. Should 
the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future 
quarter, the Notes will be convertible at their holders’ option during the 
immediately following quarter. As of December 31, 2014, the if-converted value 
of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes did not exceed the principal value of those 
Notes.

In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the 
respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option of 
$188.1 million for the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in 
stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2019 Notes and 2021 
Notes are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 
4.89% and 5.96%, respectively, over the contractual terms of the notes. During 
the year ended December 31, 2014, we recognized $64.0 million of interest 
expense related to the amortization of the debt discount. As of December 31, 
2014, the net carrying value of 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes was $759.9 million and
$1.05 billion, respectively. The remaining bond discounts of the 2019 Notes and 
2021 Notes of $160.1 million and $333.4 million will be amortized over their 
remaining lives of approximately 3.9 years and 5.9 years.

In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into 
convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase 
initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of 
approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately
$359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was
$524.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the 
warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for 
certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $512.66 for the 2019 Notes and a total of 
approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per 
share for 2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale 
of these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional 
notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and 
paid an aggregate $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 
0.3 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of $512.66 per share 
for the warrants relating to 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5 
million shares of our common stock at a strike price of $560.64 per share for 
the warrants relating to 2021 Notes. We received aggregate proceeds of 
approximately $50.8 million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, the 
purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to
offset any actual dilution from the conversion of these notes and to effectively
increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share in the 
case of warrants relating to 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 in the case 
of warrants relating to 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain 
accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in 
stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost 
incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated 
balance sheet as of December 31, 2014.

1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions

In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes 
in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting 
transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million 
of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes which 
we recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the 
effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2018 Notes. The 
interest under the 2018 Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable 
semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on 
December 1, 2013. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and 2013, we 
recognized $2.0 million and $1.2 million, respectively, of interest expense 
related to the amortization of debt issuance costs and $9.8 million and $5.9 
million, respectively, of coupon interest expense.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes will initially be convertible into 
8.0306 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion 
price of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the 
occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their 2018
Notes at their option on or after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 
Notes may convert their 2018 Notes at their option prior to March 1, 2018, only 
under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after
the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2013, if the last reported sale price of
our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) 
during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal 
quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each 
applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any 
five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2018 
Notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of our common 
stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make 
specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate
transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay the holders in cash for the 
principal amount of the 2018 Notes and, if applicable, shares of our common 
stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such 
shares of our common stock) based on a calculated daily conversion value. If a 
fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2018 Notes 
may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a 
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes, plus 
any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur
prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder 
who elects to convert its 2018 Notes in connection with such a corporate event 
in certain circumstances.

In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the 2018 Notes from 
the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $82.8 million in 
stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discount on the 2018 Notes is being 
amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.29% over the 
contractual term of the 2018 Notes. During the years ended December 31, 2014 and
2013, we recognized $15.5 million and $9.1 million, respectively, of interest 
expense related to the amortization of the debt discount. As of December 31, 
2014, the net carrying value of the 2018 Notes was $601.6 million. The remaining
bond discounts of the 2018 Notes of $58.2 million will be amortized over its 
remaining life of approximately 3.2 years.

In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially 
(subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million 
shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The 
cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition,
we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase
initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 
million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received 
$120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together,
the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are 
intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and
to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per
share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible 
note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not 
accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the 
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to 
additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 
2014.

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the closing price of our common stock 
exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 
20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of
2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2015. As such, we
classified the $601.6 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current 
liabilities and classified $58.2 million, representing the difference between 
the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $659.8 million and the carrying 
value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2014. Similarly, debt issuance costs were classified as other 
current assets as of December 31, 2014. Should the closing price conditions be 
met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future quarter, 2018 Notes will be 
convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter. 
As of December 31, 2014, the if-converted value of the 2018 Notes exceeded the 
aggregate principal amount by $518.7 million.

Contractual Obligations

As of December 31, 2014, aggregate future principal payments for our convertible
senior notes were as follows (in thousands):

  Years ending December 31,                 
 ────────────────────────────────────────────
                       2015        659,795  
                       2016                 
                       2017                 
                       2018                 
                       2019        920,000  
                 Thereafter      1,380,000  
                      Total      2,959,795  

During the fourth quarter of 2014, the closing price of our common stock 
exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 
20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of
2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2015. As such, we
have included the principal payment of the 2018 Notes in the 2015 category in 
the table above.

Full Repayment of Department of Energy Loan Facility

In May 2013, in connection with the closing of our offerings of common stock and
Notes, we paid $451.8 million to settle all outstanding loan amounts of $441.0 
million, including principal and interest, as well as an early repayment penalty
of $10.8 million which was recorded in interest expense for the year ended 
December 31, 2013. Upon termination of the DOE Loan Facility, $29.3 million held
in this dedicated account was released by the DOE.

On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing 
Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles 
Manufacturing (ATVM) Incentive Program. This loan facility was amended in June 
2011 to expand our cash investment options, in February 2012 to modify the 
timing of certain future financial covenants and funding of the debt service 
reserve account, and in June and December 2012 to allow us to affect certain 
initiatives in our business plan. In September 2012, we entered into an 
amendment with the DOE to remove our obligation to comply with the current ratio
financial covenant as of September 30, 2012 and amend the timing of pre-funding 
the principal payment due in June 2013. We entered into another amendment with 
the DOE in March 2013 that, among other things, modified certain future 
financial covenants, accelerated the maturity date of the DOE Loan Facility to 
December 15, 2017, created an obligation to repay approximately 1.0% of the 
outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before June 15, 2013, 
and created additional contingent obligations based on excess cash flows that 
may result in accelerated repayment of the DOE Loan Facility starting in 2015. 
The original amortization schedule for the DOE Loan Facility was not affected by
this amendment, and so the debt service payments remained the same until the new
maturity date when all outstanding loans under the DOE Loan Facility were to be 
repaid. We refer to the loan facility with the DOE, as amended, as the DOE Loan 
Facility. Under the DOE Loan Facility, the FFB made available to us two 
multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $465.0 
million. As of August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down the aforementioned 
facilities.

All outstanding amounts under the DOE Loan Facility were repayable in quarterly 
installments, which commenced on December 15, 2012 and would be due on the 
maturity date of December 15, 2017. All obligations under the DOE Loan Facility 
were secured by substantially all of our property.

The DOE Loan Facility documents contained customary covenants that included, 
among others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with 
the business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM
Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries’ ability to incur 
indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or 
acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital 
stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates,
enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and
enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary 
exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contained customary financial 
covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current 
liabilities, and (i) a limit on capital expenditures, (ii) from December 31, 
2013, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum 
fixed charge coverage ratio, and (iii) from March 31, 2014, a maximum ratio of 
total liabilities to shareholder equity. We were in compliance with our current 
applicable financial covenants as of March 31, 2013. The DOE Loan Facility 
documents also contained customary events of default, subject in some cases to 
customary cure periods for certain defaults. In addition, events of default 
included a failure of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), and certain 
of his affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we would complete the 
project relating to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65% of capital stock 
held by Mr. Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility. As
part of the amendment to the DOE Loan Facility in March 2013, we agreed to, 
among other things, (i) make an early payment of approximately 1.0% of the 
outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before June 15, 2013, 
(ii) make additional quarterly prepayments equal to: 20% of our excess cash flow
for each quarter of fiscal 2015; and 35% of our excess cash flow for each 
quarter of fiscal 2016 and 2017.

Under the DOE Loan Facility, we had agreed to pre-fund a dedicated debt service 
reserve account with our planned loan repayments as required by the DOE loan 
facility. As of December 31, 2012, $14.9 million was held in this dedicated 
account and classified this cash as current restricted cash on the consolidated 
balance sheet.

DOE Warrant Expiration

In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we issued in January 
2010 a warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E 
convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Upon the 
completion of our initial public offering on July 2, 2010, this preferred stock 
warrant became a warrant to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common stock at 
an exercise price of $7.54 per share. Since the number of shares ultimately 
issuable under the warrants would vary depending on the average outstanding 
balance of the loan during the contractual vesting period, and decisions to 
prepay would be influenced by our future stock price as well as the interest 
rates on our loans in relation to market interest rates, we had historically 
measured the fair value of the warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. 
The Monte Carlo approach simulates and captures the optimal decisions to be made
between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE warrant. For the 
purposes of the simulation, the optimal decision represents the scenario with 
the lowest economic cost to us. The total warrant value would then be calculated
as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our 
valuation date. The prepayment feature which allowed us to prepay the DOE Loan 
Facility, and consequently affected the number of shares ultimately issuable 
under the DOE warrant, was determined to represent an embedded derivative. This 
embedded derivative was inherently valued and accounted for as part of the 
warrant liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the fair value 
of the embedded derivative were reflected as part of the warrant liability 
re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet reporting date. The warrant 
was recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value 
reflected in other income (expense), net, until its expiration or vesting. As of
December 31, 2012, the fair value of the DOE warrant was $10.7 million. During 
the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized expense for the change in the 
fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of $1.9 million through other income
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. The fair value of 
the warrant at issuance was $6.3 million, and along with the DOE Loan Facility 
fee of $0.5 million and other debt issuance costs of $0.9 million, represented a
cost of closing the loan facility and was being amortized to interest expense 
over the expected term of the DOE Loan Facility. During the year ended December 
31, 2012, we amortized $0.6 million to interest expense, respectively.

As a result of our repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the
DOE Loan Facility and the termination of the DOE Loan Facility in May 2013, the 
DOE warrant expired. As such, we recognized other income for the change in the 
fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of $10.7 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2013. Additionally, we amortized all remaining unamortized debt 
issuance costs of $5.8 million related to the DOE Loan Facility to interest 
expense for the year ended December 31, 2013.
