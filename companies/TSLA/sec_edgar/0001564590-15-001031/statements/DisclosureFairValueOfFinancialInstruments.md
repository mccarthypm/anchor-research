| **  Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | 4. Fair Value of Financial Instruments

The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, 
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate 
their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the 
fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier
fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
(Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are 
observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in
which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own 
assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when 
available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair 
value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities. Our restricted short-term
marketable securities are classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy.

All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised 
primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value
hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices 
for similar securities.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, the fair value hierarchy for our financial 
assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows 
(in thousands):

The estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes based on a market approach was 
approximately $1.22 billion (par value $659.8 million) as of December 31, 2014 
and $914.9 million (par value of $660.0 million) as of December 31, 2013, 
respectively, and represent a Level II valuation. The estimated fair value of 
our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes based on a market approach was approximately 
$852.2 million (par value $920.0 million) and $1.25 billion (par value of $1.38 
billion) as of December 31, 2014, respectively, and represents a Level II 
valuation. When determining the estimated fair value of our long-term debt, we 
used a commonly accepted valuation methodology and market-based risk 
measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk.
