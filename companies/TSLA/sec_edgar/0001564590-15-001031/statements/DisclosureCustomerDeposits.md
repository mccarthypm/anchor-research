| **  Customer Deposits** | 5. Customer Deposits

We collect deposits from customers at the time they place an order for a vehicle
and, in some locations, at certain additional milestones up to the point of 
delivery. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary depending on the vehicle 
model and country of delivery. Customer deposits related to Model X still 
represent fully refundable reservations. Amounts are included in current 
liabilities until refunded or until they are applied to a customer’s purchase 
balance at time of delivery.

As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we held $257.6 million and $163.2 million, 
respectively, in customer deposits.
