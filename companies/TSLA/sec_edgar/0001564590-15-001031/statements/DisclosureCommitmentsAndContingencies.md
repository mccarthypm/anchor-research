Operating Leases

Our corporate headquarters and powertrain production operations are based in 
Palo Alto, California where we have leased a facility consisting of 350,000 
square feet. This lease expires in January 2020. We lease a 203,772 square feet 
manufacturing facility in Tilburg, Netherlands through November 2023. We also 
lease a number of properties in North America, Europe and Asia for our office, 
retail and service locations as well as Supercharger sites under non-cancelable 
operating leases with various expiration dates through March 2028.

Included within Operating Leases commitments in the table below are payments due
under operating leases that have been accounted for as build-to-suit 
arrangements and are included in property, plant, and equipment in our 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $46.3 
million, $21.5 million and $12.1 million, respectively.

Capital Leases

We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases 
over terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are 
collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property, plant and
equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets under the categories of 
computer equipment and software and office furniture and equipment.

Future minimum commitments for leases as of December 31, 2014 are as follows (in

Environmental Liabilities

In connection with our Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California, we are 
obligated to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions 
existing at the time we purchased the property from New United Motor 
Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). Tesla is responsible for the first $15 million of 
remediation costs and any costs in excess of $30 million or costs incurred after
the ten-year anniversary of closing. NUMMI is responsible for remediation costs 
between $15 million and $30 million for up to 10 years from the closing date. 
Through December 31, 2014, we have paid $3.1 million for remediation costs 
incurred related to the Fremont facility. As of December 31, 2014 and 2013, we 
accrued a total of $4.0 million and $5.5 million related to these environmental 
liabilities.

Legal Proceedings

From time to time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from 
the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to time, third 
parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims against us in the 
form of letters and other forms of communication. If an unfavorable ruling were 
to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our 
results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and brand.

In November 2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against 
Tesla in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California, alleging 
violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections 10(b) and 20(a) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule 10b-5. The complaint, made claims 
against Tesla and its CEO, Elon Musk, sought damages and attorney’s fees on the 
basis of allegations that, among other things, Tesla and Mr. Musk made false 
and/or misleading representations and omissions, including with respect to the 
safety of Model S. This case was brought on behalf of a putative class 
consisting of certain persons who purchased Tesla’s securities between August 
19, 2013 and November 17, 2013. On September 26, 2014, the trial court, upon the
motion of Tesla and Mr. Musk, dismissed the complaint with prejudice, and 
indicated that a formal written order will be forthcoming. Following the trial 
court’s decision, Tesla and Mr. Musk brought a motion for sanctions against the 
plaintiffs, and that motion is currently pending. The plaintiffs have also 
appealed from the trial court’s order, and that appeal is pending, as well.
