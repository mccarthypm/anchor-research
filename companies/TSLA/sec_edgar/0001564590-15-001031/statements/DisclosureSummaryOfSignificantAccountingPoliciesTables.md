Model S Leasing Program

In April 2014, we began offering a leasing program in the United States and 
Canada for Model S. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a Model S for 36
months, after which time they have the option of either returning the vehicle to
us or purchasing it for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these 
leasing transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize leasing 
revenues over the contractual term of the individual leases and depreciate the 
cost of the respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to 
cost of automotive sales over the same period. As of December 31, 2014, we had 
deferred $9.4 million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized
on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. 
Lease revenues are recorded in automotive sales and for the year ended December 
31, 2014, we recognized $4.4 million.
