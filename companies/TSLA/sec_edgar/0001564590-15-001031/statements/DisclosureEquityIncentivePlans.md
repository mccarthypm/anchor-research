In July 2003, we adopted the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the 
effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on June 28, 2010, we 
adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan) and all remaining common 
shares reserved for future grant or issuance under the 2003 Equity Incentive 
Plan were added to the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the 
granting of stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights to our employees, 
directors and consultants. Options granted under the Plan may be either 
incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be 
granted only to our employees including officers and directors. Nonqualified 
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and 
consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and are 
exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten years from 
the date the stock options are granted. Continued vesting typically terminates 
when the employment or consulting relationship ends. As of December 31, 2014, 
22,853,070 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Plan.

The following table summarizes stock option and RSU activity under the Plan:

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i. 
e., the difference between our common stock price and the exercise price, 
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received 
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options. The 
aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2014 and 
2013 was $4.00 billion and $2.80 billion, respectively. The intrinsic value of 
options exercisable was $2.46 billion and $1.48 billion, and the intrinsic value
of options vested and expected to vest was $4.00 billion and $2.80 billion as of
December 31, 2014 and 2013, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options 
exercised was $446.9 million and $294.0 million for the years ended December 31,
2014 and 2013, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding 
as of December 31, 2014 was $329.2 million.

Fair Value Adoption

We utilize the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation 
expense. Under the fair value method, we estimated the fair value of each option
award and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model and the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table.

The risk-free interest rate that we use is based on the United States Treasury 
yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon United States Treasury 
notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Given our 
limited history with employee grants, we use the “simplified” method in 
estimating the expected term for our employee grants. The “simplified” method, 
as permitted by the SEC, is calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and
the contractual life of the options.

Our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility on publicly 
traded options of our common stock and the historical volatilities of several 
unrelated public companies within industries related to our business, including 
the automotive OEM, automotive retail, automotive parts and battery technology 
industries, because we have limited trading history on our common stock. When 
making the selections of our peer companies within industries related to our 
business to be used in the volatility calculation, we also considered the stage 
of development, size and financial leverage of potential comparable companies. 
Our historical volatility and implied volatility are weighted based on certain 
qualitative factors and combined to produce a single volatility factor.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for option awards granted during the 
years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $94.01, $40.72 and $16.37 per 
share, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value for ESPP granted
during the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $74.07, $19.22 and 
$8.99 per share, respectively. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant 
date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock.

Performance-Based Stock Options

In December 2009, our Board of Directors approved an option grant to our CEO 
representing 4% of our fully-diluted share base prior to such grant as of the 
grant date, or 3,355,986 stock options, with 1/4th of the shares vesting 
immediately, and 1/36th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest each month 
over three years, assuming continued employment through each vesting date in 
recognition of his and our company’s achievements and to create incentives for 
future success. In addition, to create incentives for the attainment of clear 
performance objectives around a key element of our business plan - the 
successful launch and commercialization of Model S - the Board of Directors 
approved an additional option grant to our CEO totaling an additional 4% of our 
fully-diluted shares prior to such grant as of the grant date, or 3,355,986 
stock options, with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of 
performance objectives as follows, assuming our CEO’s continued employment and 
service to us through each vesting date:

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
successful completion of Model S Engineering Prototype;  
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
successful completion of Model S Validation Prototype;  
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
completion of the first Model S Production Vehicle; and  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
completion of the 10,000th Model S Production Vehicle.  

Through December 31, 2013, all performance milestones were achieved. Stock-based
compensation expense related to this grant to our CEO was $0.4 million and $4.2 
million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Our Board of Directors also approved option grants in June and September 2010 to
purchase our common stock of 666,300 and 20,000, respectively, to various 
members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of the same performance objectives as those outlined for our CEO 
above. Through December 31, 2013, all performance milestones were achieved. 
During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized $0.8 million 
and $1.4 million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to 
the attainment of these performance objectives.

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock options to our 
CEO (2012 CEO Grant). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a
vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions
and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service to us through 
each vesting date.

Each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten 
pre-determined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase
in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial market 
capitalization of $3.2 billion measured at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant.

  Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle;  

  Gross margin of 30% or more for four consecutive quarters;  
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles;  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 200,000 vehicles; and  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 300,000 vehicles.  

The term of the 2012 CEO Grant is ten years, so any tranches that remain 
unvested at the expiration of the 2012 CEO Grant will be forfeited. In addition,
unvested options will be forfeited if our CEO is no longer in that role, whether
for cause or otherwise.

We measured the fair value of the 2012 CEO Grant using a Monte Carlo simulation 
approach with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.65%, 
expected term of ten years, expected volatility of 55% and dividend yield of 0%.

Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2012 CEO Grant is 
recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of
the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, 
beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is 
considered probable of being met.

As of December 31, 2014, the market conditions for six vesting tranches and the 
following performance milestone were achieved and approved by our Board of 
Directors:

  Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype.  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

As of December 31, 2014, the following performance milestone was achieved and 
subject to our Board of Directors’ approval at the upcoming board meeting:

  Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

As of December 31, 2014, the following three performance milestones were 
considered probable of achievement:

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype; and  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles.  

As the above three performance milestones were considered probable of 
achievement, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $25.0 million, 
$14.5 million and $1.3 million for the years ended December 31, 2014, 2013 and 
2012. No cash compensation has ever been received by our CEO for his services to
the company.

In January 2014, to create incentives for continued long term success beyond the
Model S program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ 
interests in the achievement of significant milestones by our company, the 
Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock options to 
certain employees to purchase 782,500 shares of our common stock. Each such 
grant consists of four vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely 
on the attainment of future performance milestones, assuming continued 
employment and service to us through each vesting date.

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
achieving aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 
12-month period;  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle; and  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
achievement of annualized gross margin of greater than 30.0% in any three years.

As of December 31, 2014, the following performance milestone was considered 
probable of achievement.

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle.  

As the above performance milestone was considered probable of achievement, we 
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $10.7 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2014.

periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances.

As of December 31, 2014, we had $412.7 million of total unrecognized 
compensation expense, net, of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized 
over a weighted-average period of 5.0 years.
