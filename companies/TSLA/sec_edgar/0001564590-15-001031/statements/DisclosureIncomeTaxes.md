Management believes that based on the available information, it is more likely 
than not that the U. S. deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a 
full valuation allowance is required against all U. S. deferred tax assets. The 
Company has net $0.3 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions 
which it believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the 
expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2014, we had approximately $1.34 billion of federal and 
$991.8 million of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset 
future taxable income, which will begin to expire for federal in 2024 and 2019 
for state purposes. As of December 31, 2014, the portion of net operating loss 
carryforwards related to stock options is approximately $590.0 million and 
$307.6 million for federal and state purposes, respectively, of which the tax 
benefits will be credited to additional paid-in capital when realized. 
Additionally, we have research and development tax credits of approximately 
$33.8 million and $36.6 million for federal and state income tax purposes, 
respectively. If not utilized, the federal carry-forwards will expire in various
amounts beginning in 2019. However, the state credits can be carried forward 
indefinitely.

No deferred tax liability has been recognized for the remittance of any 
undistributed foreign earnings to the United States since the Company has no 
material amount of undistributed foreign earnings outside of our U. S. tax 
jurisdiction as of December 31, 2014.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We determined 
that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net 
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to any prior ownership changes.

Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are 
classified as income tax expense and was immaterial. As of December 31, 2014, 
unrecognized tax benefits of $39.1 million, if recognized, would not affect our 
effective tax rate as the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which
is currently fully offset with a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate 
that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly 
increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We file income tax returns in 
the United States, California, various states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax 
years 2003 to 2013 remain subject to examination for federal purposes, and tax 
years 2003 to 2013 remain subject to examination for California purposes. All 
net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment
for U. S. federal and California purposes. Tax years 2007 to 2013 remain open 
for examination in other U. S. state and foreign jurisdictions.
