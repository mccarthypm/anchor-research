  Out of the $350.0 million authorized to be issued, $17.9 million remained

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only specified assets of 
our subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the 
net carrying values are due to convertible senior note conversion features, debt
discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2017, we were in 
compliance with all financial debt covenants, which include minimum liquidity 
and expense-coverage balances and ratios.

2018 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.50% 
Convertible Senior Notes due in June 2018 in a public offering. The net proceeds
from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $648.0 million.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes is initially convertible into 8.0306 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified 
events. Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after 
March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 Notes may convert, at their option, 
prior to March 1, 2018 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any 
quarter beginning after September 30, 2013, if the closing price of our common 
stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last 
30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is greater than or
equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the five-business day period 
following any five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price of 
the 2018 Notes is less than 98% of the product of the closing price of our 
common stock for each day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3)
if we make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if 
specified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay cash for 
the principal amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of our common stock 
(subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares
of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change 
occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2018 Notes may require us to 
repurchase all or a portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a repurchase price 
equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In 
addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we 
would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2018 
Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of December 
31, 2017, at least one of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2018 
Notes to early convert had been met. Therefore, the 2018 Notes were classified 
as current.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2018 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $82.8 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of 4.29%.

In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 5.3 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note 
hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the
holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to 
adjustment for certain specified events) 5.3 million shares of our common stock 
at a price of $184.48 per share. We received $120.3 million in cash proceeds 
from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible
note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential 
dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and to effectively increase the 
overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per share. As these 
transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and 
warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as 
derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge
and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in 
capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

In the second quarter of 2017, $144.8 million in aggregate principal amount of 
the 2018 Notes were exchanged for 1,163,442 shares of our common stock (see Note
14, Common Stock). As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of 
$1.1 million.

In the third quarter of 2017, $42.7 million in aggregate principal amount of the
2018 Notes were exchanged or converted for 250,198 shares of our common stock 
(see Note 14, Common Stock) and $32.7 million in cash. As a result, we 
recognized a loss on debt extinguishment of $0.3 million.

In the fourth quarter of 2017, $12.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 
the 2018 Notes were exchanged or converted for 96,634 shares of our common stock
(see Note 14, Common Stock). As a result, we recognized a loss on debt 
extinguishment of $0.1 million.

2019 Notes, 2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% 
Convertible Senior Notes due in March 2019 and $1.20 billion in aggregate 
principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in March 2021 in a public
offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million in aggregate 
principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $180.0 million in aggregate principal 
amount of the 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment 
options by the underwriters. The total net proceeds from the issuances, after 
deducting transaction costs, were $905.8 million for the 2019 Notes and $1.36 
billion for the 2021 Notes.

Each $1,000 of principal of these notes is initially convertible into 2.7788 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified 
events. Holders of these notes may elect to convert on or after December 1, 2018
for the 2019 Notes and December 1, 2020 for the 2021 Notes. The settlement of 
such an election to convert the 2019 Notes would be in cash and/or shares of our
common stock, with the split at our discretion, on the maturity date. The 
settlement of such an election to convert the 2021 Notes would be in cash for 
the principal amount and, if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to 
our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our 
common stock), on the maturity date. Further, holders of these notes may 
convert, at their option, prior to the respective dates above only under the 
following circumstances: (1) during a quarter in which the closing price of our 
common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during 
the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is 
greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the 
five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in 
which the trading price of these notes is less than 98% of the product of the 
closing price of our common stock for each day during such five-consecutive 
trading day period or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our 
common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon such a 
conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or deliver (as applicable) cash, 
shares of our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. Upon such 
a conversion of the 2021 Notes, we would pay cash for the principal amount and, 
if applicable, deliver shares of our common stock (subject to our right to 
deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) 
based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the 
applicable maturity date, holders of these notes may require us to repurchase 
all or a portion of their notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of 
the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if 
specific corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we would 
increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in 
connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2017,
none of the conditions permitting the holders of these notes to early convert 
had been met. Therefore, these notes were classified as long-term.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion features associated with these notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $188.1 million for the 2019 Notes’ conversion 
feature and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes’ conversion feature. The resulting
debt discounts are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest 
rate of 4.89% and 5.96%, respectively.

In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into 
convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase 
initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of 5.6 
million shares of our common stock at a price of $359.87 per share. The total 
cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $524.7 million. In addition,
we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase
initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 2.2 million 
shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes 
and 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for 
2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in total cash proceeds from the sales of 
these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of the additional 
notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and 
paid a total of $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase 
initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 0.3 million 
shares of our common stock at a price of $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes 
and 0.5 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for 
the 2021 Notes. We received $50.8 million in total cash proceeds from the sales 
of these warrants. Taken together, the purchases of the convertible note hedges 
and the sales of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or 
cash payments from the conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the
overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes 
and from $359.87 to $560.64 per share for the 2021 Notes. As these transactions 
meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are 
recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The 
net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant 
transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the 
consolidated balance sheet.

2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In March 2017, we issued $977.5 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.375% 
Convertible Senior Notes due in March 2022 in a public offering. The net 
proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $965.9 
million.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is initially convertible into 3.0534 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of $327.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified 
events. Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after 
December 15, 2021. Further, holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their 
option, prior to December 15, 2021 only under the following circumstances: (1) 
during any quarter beginning after June 30, 2017, if the closing price of our 
common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during 
the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is 
greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the 
five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in 
which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less than 98% of the product of the
closing price of our common stock for each day during such five-consecutive 
trading day period or (3) if we make specified distributions to holders of our 
common stock or if specified corporate transactions occur. Upon a conversion, we
would pay cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of 
our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a 
portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. 
If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 
Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash
at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and
unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the 
maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to 
convert its 2022 Notes in connection with such an event in certain 
circumstances. As of December 31, 2017, none of the conditions permitting the 
holders of the 2022 Notes to early convert had been met. Therefore, the 2022 
Notes are classified as long-term.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $145.6 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of 6.00%.

In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $327.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note 
hedge transactions was $204.1 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the
holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to 
adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock 
at a price of $655.00 per share. We received $52.9 million in cash proceeds from
the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note
hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution 
from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall 
conversion price from $327.50 to $655.00 per share. As these transactions meet 
certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are 
recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The 
net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant 
transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the 
consolidated balance sheet.

2025 Notes

In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of 
unsecured 5.30% Senior Notes due in August 2025 pursuant to Rule 144A and 
Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance, after
deducting transaction costs, were $1.77 billion.

Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement 
(the “ Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. Borrowed funds bear 
interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus LIBOR or (b) the 
highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the lenders’ “prime rate”
or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 0.25% per annum. The 
Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts receivable, inventory and
equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is based on the value of such
assets, as reduced by certain reserves. During 2017, the committed amount under 
the Credit Agreement was upsized three times.

Secured Revolving Credit Facility

SolarCity entered into a revolving credit agreement with a syndicate of banks 
(the “ Secured Revolving Credit Facility”) to fund working capital, letters of 
credit and general corporate needs. Borrowed funds bore interest, at our option,
at an annual rate of (a) 3.25% plus LIBOR or (b) 2.25% plus the highest of (i) 
the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) Bank of America’s published “prime rate”
or (iii) LIBOR plus 1.00%. The fee for undrawn commitments was 0.375% per annum.
The Secured Revolving Credit Facility was secured by certain of SolarCity’s 
accounts receivable, inventory, machinery, equipment and other assets. In August
2017, the Secured Revolving Credit Facility was terminated, and the aggregate 
outstanding principal amount of $324.0 million was fully repaid.

Vehicle and Other Loans

We have entered into various vehicle and other loan agreements with various 
financial institutions. The vehicle loans are secured by the vehicles financed.

2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2018

In October 2013, SolarCity issued $230.0 million in aggregate principal amount 
of 2.75% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2018 in a public offering.

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into
1.7838 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$560.64 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events
related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). Holders of the 
convertible senior notes may convert, at their option, at any time up to and 
including the second trading day prior to the maturity date. If certain events 
that would constitute a make-whole fundamental change (such as significant 
changes in ownership, corporate structure or tradability of our common stock) 
occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a 
holder who elects to convert its convertible senior notes in connection with 
such an event in certain circumstances. The maximum conversion rate is capped at
2.3635 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes, 
which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $423.10 per share. The 
convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The convertible 
senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible senior notes 
for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes.

1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019

In September 2014, SolarCity issued $500.0 million and in October 2014, 
SolarCity issued an additional $66.0 million in aggregate principal amount of 
1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2019 in a private placement.

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into
1.3169 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$759.36 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events
related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). The maximum conversion 
rate is capped at 1.7449 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible 
senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $573.10 per 
share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The 
convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible 
senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes.

In connection with the issuance of the convertible senior notes in September and
October 2014, SolarCity entered into capped call option agreements to reduce the
potential dilution upon the conversion of the convertible senior notes. 
Specifically, upon the exercise of the capped call options, we would now receive
shares of our common stock equal to 745,377 shares multiplied by (a) (i) the 
lower of $1,146.18 or the then market price of our common stock less (ii) 
$759.36 and divided by (b) the then market price of our common stock. The 
results of this formula are that we would receive more shares as the market 
price of our common stock exceeds $759.36 and approaches $1,146.18, but we would
receive less shares as the market price of our common stock exceeds $1,146.18. 
Consequently, if the convertible senior notes are converted, then the number of 
shares to be issued by us would be effectively partially offset by the shares 
received by us under the capped call options. We can also elect to receive the 
equivalent value of cash in lieu of shares. The capped call options expire on 
various dates ranging from September 4, 2019 to October 29, 2019, and the 
formula above would be adjusted in the event of a merger; a tender offer; 
nationalization; insolvency; delisting of our common stock; changes in law; 
failure to deliver; insolvency filing; stock splits, combinations, dividends, 
repurchases or similar events or an announcement of certain of the preceding 
actions. Although intended to reduce the net number of shares issued after a 
conversion of the convertible senior notes, the capped call options were 
separately negotiated transactions, are not a part of the terms of the 
convertible senior notes, do not affect the rights of the convertible senior 
note holders and take effect regardless of whether the convertible senior notes 
are actually converted. The capped call options meet the criteria for equity 
classification because they are indexed to our common stock and we always 
control whether settlement will be in shares or cash.

Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020

In December 2015, SolarCity issued $113.0 million in aggregate principal amount 
of Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due on December 1, 2020 in a private 
placement. $13.0 million of the convertible senior notes were issued to related 
parties and are separately presented on the consolidated balance sheets (see 
Note 21, Related Party Transactions).

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into
3.3333 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$300.00 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events
related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). The maximum conversion 
rate is capped at 4.2308 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible 
senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $236.36 per 
share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The 
convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible 
senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes. On or 
after June 30, 2017, the convertible senior notes are redeemable by us in the 
event that the closing price of our common stock exceeds 200% of the conversion 
price for 45 consecutive trading days ending within three trading days of such 
redemption notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount 
plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

On April 26, 2017, our CEO converted all of his Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior 
Notes due in 2020, which had an aggregate principal amount of $10.0 million (see
Note 14, Common Stock). As a result, we recognized a loss on debt extinguishment
of $2.2 million.

Related Party Promissory Notes due in February 2018

On April 11, 2017, our CEO, SolarCity’s former CEO and SolarCity’s former Chief 
Technology Officer exchanged their $100.0 million (collectively) in aggregate 
principal amount of 6.50% Solar Bonds due in February 2018 for promissory notes 
in the same amounts and with substantially the same terms.

Solar Bonds

Solar Bonds are senior unsecured obligations that are structurally subordinate 
to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Solar Bonds were 
issued under multiple series with various terms and interest rates. In April 
2017, we extinguished certain series of Solar Bonds by prepaying $20.9 million 
of principal and interest. See Note 21, Related Party Transactions, for Solar 
Bonds issued to related parties.

Warehouse Agreements

On August 31, 2016, our subsidiaries entered into the a loan and security 
agreement (the “2016 Warehouse Agreement”) for borrowings secured by the future 
cash flows arising from certain leases and the associated leased vehicles. On 
August 17, 2017, the 2016 Warehouse Agreement was amended to modify the interest
rates and extend the availability period and the maturity date, and our 
subsidiaries entered into another loan and security agreement with substantially
the same terms as and that shares the same committed amount with the 2016 
Warehouse Agreement. We refer to these agreements together as the “ Warehouse 
Agreements.” Amounts drawn under the Warehouse Agreements generally bear 
interest at (i) LIBOR plus a fixed margin or (ii) the commercial paper rate. The
Warehouse Agreements are non-recourse to our other assets.

Pursuant to the Warehouse Agreements, an undivided beneficial interest in the 
future cash flows arising from certain leases and the related leased vehicles 
has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in the 
consolidated financial statements. The interest in the future cash flows arising
from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims of
our creditors other than pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the 
Warehouse Agreements. We retain the right to receive the excess cash flows not 
needed to pay obligations under the Warehouse Agreements.

Canada Credit Facility

In December 2016, one of our subsidiaries entered into a credit agreement (the “
Canada Credit Facility”) with a bank for borrowings secured by our interests in 
certain vehicle leases, and in December 2017, the Canada Credit Facility was 
amended to add our interests in additional vehicle leases as collateral, 
allowing us to draw additional funds. Amounts drawn under the Canada Credit 
Facility bear interest at fixed rates. The Canada Credit Facility is 
non-recourse to our other assets.

Term Loan due in December 2018

On March 31, 2016, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement for a 
term loan. The term loan bears interest at an annual rate of the lender’s cost 
of funds plus 3.25%. The fee for undrawn commitments is 0.85% per annum. On 
March31, 2017, the agreement was amended to upsize the committed amount, extend 
the availability period and extend the maturity date. The term loan is secured 
by substantially all of the assets of the subsidiary and is non-recourse to our 
other assets.

Term Loan due in January 2021

In January 2016, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement with a 
syndicate of banks for a term loan. The term loan bears interest at an annual

all of the assets of the subsidiary, including its interests in certain 
financing funds, and is non-recourse to our other assets.

MyPower Revolving Credit Facility

On January 9, 2015, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into a revolving credit 
agreement with a syndicate of banks to obtain funding for the MyPower customer

commitments under the Class A notes was 0.50% per annum. The fee for undrawn 
commitments under the Class B notes was 0.50% per annum. The MyPower revolving 
credit facility was secured by the payments owed to us under MyPower customer

revolving credit facility matured, and the aggregate outstanding principal 
amount of $133.8 million was fully repaid.

Revolving Aggregation Credit Facility

On May 4, 2015, a subsidiary of SolarCity entered into an agreement with a 
syndicate of banks for a revolving aggregation credit facility. On March 23, 
2016 and June 23, 2017, the agreement was amended to modify the interest rates 
and extend the availability period and the maturity date. The revolving 
aggregation credit facility bears interest at an annual rate of 2.75% plus (i) 
for commercial paper loans, the commercial paper rate and (ii) for LIBOR loans, 
at our option, three-month LIBOR or daily LIBOR. The revolving aggregation

Cash Equity Debt I

In connection with the cash equity financing on May 2, 2016, SolarCity issued 
$121.7 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at a 
fixed rate. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in 
certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

Cash Equity Debt III

In connection with the cash equity financing on December 16, 2016, we issued 
$170.0 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that bears interest at a 
fixed rate. This debt is secured by, among other things, our interests in 
certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

Solar Asset-backed Notes, Series 2013-1

In November 2013, SolarCity pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy 
systems and the associated customer contracts into a Special Purpose Entity (“ 
SPE”) and issued $54.4 million in aggregate principal amount of Solar 
Asset-backed Notes, Series 2013-1, backed by these solar assets to investors. 
The SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in the financial statements. 
As of December 31, 2017, these solar assets had a carrying value of $89.0 
million and are included within solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, 
net, on the consolidated balance sheets. The Solar Asset-backed Notes were 
issued at a discount of 0.05%. The cash flows generated by these solar assets 
are used to service the monthly principal and interest payments on the Solar 
Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is 
distributed to one of our wholly owned subsidiaries. We recognize revenue earned
from the associated customer contracts in accordance with our revenue 
recognition policy. The SPE’s assets and cash flows are not available to our 
other creditors, and the creditors of the SPE, including the Solar Asset-backed 
Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. SolarCity contracted with 
the SPE to provide operations & maintenance and administrative services for the 
solar energy systems.

In connection with the pooling of the solar assets that were transferred to the 
SPE in November 2013, SolarCity terminated a lease pass-through arrangement with
an investor. The lease pass-through arrangement had been accounted for as a 
borrowing, and the amount outstanding under the lease pass-through arrangement 
was recorded as a lease pass-through financing obligation. The balance that was 
then outstanding under the lease pass-through arrangement was $56.4 million. 
SolarCity paid the investor an aggregate of $40.2 million, and the remaining 
balance is paid over time using the net cash flows generated by the assets 
previously leased under the lease pass-through arrangement, after payment of the
principal and interest on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and expenses related to 
the assets and the Solar Asset-backed Notes; this was contractually documented 
as a right to participate in the future cash flows of the SPE (“participation 
interest”). The participation interest was recorded as a component of other 
long-term liabilities for the non-current portion and accrued liabilities for 
the current portion. We account for the participation interest as a liability 
because the investor has no voting or management rights in the SPE, the 
participation interest would terminate upon the investor achieving a specified 
return and the investor has the option to put the participation interest to us 
on August 3, 2021 for the amount necessary for the investor to achieve the 
specified return, which would require us to settle the participation interest in
cash. In addition, under the terms of the participation interest, we have the 
option to purchase the participation interest from the investor for the amount 
necessary for the investor to achieve the specified return.

Solar Asset-backed Notes, 2014-1

In April 2014, SolarCity pooled and transferred qualifying solar energy systems 
and the associated customer contracts into a SPE and issued $70.2 million in 
aggregate principal amount of Solar Asset-backed Notes, Series 2014-1, backed by
these solar assets to investors. The SPE is wholly owned by us and is 
consolidated in the financial statements. As of December 31, 2017, these solar 
assets had a carrying value of $109.3million and are included within solar 
energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, in the consolidated balance 
sheets. The Solar Asset-backed Notes were issued at a discount of 0.01%. The 
cash flows generated by these solar assets are used to service the monthly 
principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the 
SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to one of our wholly owned
subsidiaries. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer contracts
in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPE’s assets and cash 
flows are not available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPE, 
including the Solar Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other
