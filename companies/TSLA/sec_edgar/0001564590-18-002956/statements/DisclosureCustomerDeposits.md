| **  Customer Deposits** | Note 12 - Customer Deposits

Customer deposits primarily consisted of cash payments from customers at the 
time they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and 
any additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of 
installation, including the fair values of any customer trade-in vehicles that 
are applicable toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposit amounts and 
timing vary depending on the vehicle model, the energy product and the country 
of delivery. Customer deposits are fully refundable; in the case of a vehicle, 
up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production cycle, and in the case
of an energy generation or storage product, prior to the entry into a purchase 
agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter (in accordance with 
applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until 
refunded or until they are applied towards the customer’s purchase balance. As 
of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, we held $853.9 million and $663.9 
million, respectively, in customer deposits.
