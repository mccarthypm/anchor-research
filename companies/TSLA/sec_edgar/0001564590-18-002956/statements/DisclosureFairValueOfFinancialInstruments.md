| **  Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, 
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As 
such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based 
on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a 
liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs
should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable 
inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than 
quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or 
indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no 
market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data
when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in thousands):

All of our cash equivalents were classified within Level I of the fair value 
hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our 
interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy 
because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that 
utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates.
During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, there were no transfers 
between the levels of the fair value hierarchy.

Cash Flow Hedges

In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency 
exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in 
Japanese yen. The derivative instruments that we used were foreign currency 
forward contracts, which were designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates
of 12 months or less. We did not enter into any derivative contracts for trading
or speculative purposes.

We documented each hedging relationship and assessed its initial effectiveness 
on each inception date. We measured its subsequent effectiveness on a quarterly 
basis using regression analysis. During the term of each effective hedge 
contract, we recorded gains and losses to accumulated other comprehensive income
(loss). We reclassified these gains and losses to cost of automotive sales 
revenue when the related finished goods inventory was sold or to cost of 
automotive leasing revenue over the depreciation period when the related 
finished goods inventory was leased. All of our hedge contracts were effective, 
and we recorded no amounts related to hedge ineffectiveness during the years 
ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.

No hedge contracts were outstanding as of December 31, 2016 or thereafter. The 
net gain of $5.6 million in accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) as of 
December 31, 2016 was fully reclassified to the consolidated statement of 
operations during the year ended December 31, 2017. During the year ended 
December 31, 2016, we reclassified $44.9 million of net gains from accumulated 
other comprehensive income (loss) to the consolidated statement of operations. 
No amounts were reclassified from accumulated other comprehensive income (loss) 
to the consolidated statement of operations during the year ended December 31, 
2015.

Interest Rate Swaps

We enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable 
interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments, as required by 
certain of our lenders. We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging 
instruments. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on 
the consolidated balance sheets within other assets or other long-term 
liabilities, with any changes in their fair values recognized as other income 
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash 
flows recognized as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash 
flows. As of December 31, 2016, the aggregate notional amount of our interest 
rate swaps, their gross asset at fair value and their gross liability at fair 
value were $789.6 million, $10.6 million and $12.1 million, respectively. During
the year ended December 31, 2016, we recognized $7.0 million of gains related to
our interest rate swaps. Our interest rate swaps outstanding were as follows as 
of December 31, 2017 (in thousands):

Disclosure of Fair Values

Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include 
accounts receivable, MyPower customer notes receivable, rebates receivable, 
accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits, convertible senior 
notes, the 5.30% Senior Notes due in 2025, the participation interest, solar 
asset-backed notes, solar loan-backed notes, Solar Bonds and long-term debt. The
carrying values of these financial instruments other than the convertible senior
notes, the 5.30% Senior Notes due in 2025, the participation interest, the solar
asset-backed notes and the solar loan-backed notes approximate their fair 
values.

We estimate the fair value of the convertible senior notes and the 5.30% Senior 
Notes due in 2025 usingcommonly accepted valuation methodologies and 
market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit 
risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair value of the participation 
interest, the solar asset-backed notes and the solar loan-backed notes based on 
rates currently offered for instruments with similar maturities and terms (Level
III). The following table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying 
values (in thousands):
