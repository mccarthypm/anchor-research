In January 2018, the performance milestone for the aggregate production of 
300,000 vehicles under the 2012 CEO Grant was achieved, resulting in the vesting
of the ninth of 10 tranches under the grant.

Subject to stockholder approval, on January 21, 2018, our Board of Directors 
granted a new 10-year CEO performance award with vesting contingent upon 
achieving certain specified market capitalization and operational milestones. On
February 8, 2018, we filed a proxy statement to seek stockholder approval of the
award.

On February 6, 2018, we issued $546.1 million in aggregate principal amount of 
automobile lease-backed notes with interest rates ranging from 2.3% to 4.9% and 
maturities ranging from December 2019 to March 2021. The proceeds from the 
issuance, net of discounts and fees, were $543.1 million. Contemporaneously, we 
repaid $453.6 million of the principal outstanding under the Warehouse 
Agreements.

On February 14, 2018, our CEO and SolarCity’s former Chief Technology Officer 
exchanged their $82.5 million (collectively) in aggregate principal amount of 
6.50% promissory notes due in February 2018 for 6.50% promissory notes due in 
August 2018 in the same amounts.
