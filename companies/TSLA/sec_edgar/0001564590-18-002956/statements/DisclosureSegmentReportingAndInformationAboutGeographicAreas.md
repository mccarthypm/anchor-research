We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy 
generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development,
manufacturing and sales of electric vehicles. Additionally, the automotive 
segment is also comprised of services and other, which includes after-sales 
vehicle services, used vehicle sales, powertrain sales and services by Grohmann.
The energy generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, 
installation and sales of solar energy generation and energy storage products. 
Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability 
information. The following table presents revenues and gross margins by 
reportable segment (in thousands):
