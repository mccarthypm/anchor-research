As of December 31, 2017, future minimum lease payments to be received from 
customers under non-cancellable operating leases for each of the next five years
and thereafter were as follows (in thousands):

  2018              387,343  
  2019              328,490  
  2020              242,683  
  2021              177,123

  Total           3,804,881  

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners 
with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. In 
addition, we assumed through our acquisition of SolarCity and will continue to 
enter into power purchase agreements with our customers that are accounted for 
as leases. These customers are charged solely based on actual power produced by 
the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per kilowatt-hour of 
power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are not included in 
the above table as they are a function of the power generated by the related 
solar energy systems in the future. Furthermore, the above table does not 
include performance-based incentives receivable from various utility companies. 
The amount of contingent rentals recognized as revenue for the years presented 
were not material.
