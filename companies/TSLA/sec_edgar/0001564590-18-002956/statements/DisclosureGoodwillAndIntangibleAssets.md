Goodwill increased to $60.2 million as of December 31, 2017 due to our 
acquisitions and the impact of foreign currency translation adjustments.

Information regarding our acquired intangible assets was as follows (in

The in-process research and development (“ IPR& D”), which we acquired from 
SolarCity, is accounted for as an indefinite-lived asset until the completion or
abandonment of the associated research and development efforts. If the research 
and development efforts are successfully completed and commercial feasibility is
reached, the IPR& D would be amortized over its then estimated useful life. If 
the research and development efforts are not completed or are abandoned, the 
IPR& D might be impaired. The fair value of the IPR& D was estimated using the 
replacement cost method under the cost approach, based on the historical 
acquisition costs and expenses of the technology adjusted for estimated 
developer’s profit, opportunity cost and obsolescence factor. We expect to 
complete the research and development efforts in the first half of 2018, but 
there can be no assurance that the commercial feasibility will be achieved. The 
nature of the research and development efforts consists principally of planning,
designing and testing the technology for viability in manufacturing solar cells 
and modules. If commercial feasibility is not achieved, we would likely look to 
other alternative technologies.

Total future amortization expense for intangible assets was estimated as follows
