Leases

We have entered into various non-cancellable operating lease agreements for 
certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and 
service locations, equipment, vehicles, solar energy systems and Supercharger 
sites, throughout the world. Included within the lease commitment table below 
are payments due under operating leases that have been accounted for as 
build-to-suit lease arrangements, which are included in property, plant and 
equipment on the consolidated balance sheets. Rent expense for the years ended 
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015 was $177.7million, $116.8million and $68.2 
million, respectively.

We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases 
up to 60 months. The equipment under the leases are collateral for the lease 
obligations and are included within property, plant and equipment on the 
consolidated balance sheets.

Future minimum commitments for leases as of December31, 2017 were as follows (in
thousands):

Build-to-Suit Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

We have a build-to-suit lease arrangement with the Research Foundation for the 
State University of New York (the “ SUNY Foundation”) where the SUNY Foundation 
will construct a solar cell and panel manufacturing facility, referred to as 
Gigafactory 2, with our participation in the design and construction, install 
certain utilities and other improvements and acquire certain manufacturing 
equipment designated by us to be used in the manufacturing facility. The SUNY 
Foundation covers (i) construction costs related to the manufacturing facility 
up to $350.0 million, (ii) the acquisition and commissioning of the 
manufacturing equipment in an amount up to $274.7 million and (iii) $125.3 
million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) only, 
subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of New York; and we are
responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such amounts. 
The SUNY Foundation will own the manufacturing facility and the manufacturing 
equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation. Following completion of the 
manufacturing facility, we will lease the manufacturing facility and the 
manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an initial period of 10
years, with an option to renew, for $2.00 per year plus utilities.

Under the terms of the build-to-suit lease arrangement, we are required to 
achieve specific operational milestones during the initial lease term; which 
include employing a certain number of employees at the manufacturing facility, 
within western New York and within the State of New York within specified 
periods following the completion of the manufacturing facility. We are also 
required to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational 
expenses and other costs in the State of New York within 10 years following the 
achievement of full production. On an annual basis during the initial lease 
term, as measured on each anniversary of the commissioning of the manufacturing 
facility, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation 
requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41.2 million “program 
payment” to theSUNYFoundation for each year that we fail to meet these 
requirements. Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material 
breach by us, then additional amounts might become payable by us.

The non-cash investing and financing activities related to the arrangement 
during the year ended December 31, 2017 amounted to $86.1 million. The non-cash 
investing and financing activities related to the arrangement from the 
Acquisition Date through December 31, 2016 amounted to $5.6 million.

Environmental Liabilities

In connection with our factory located in Fremont, California, we are obligated 
to pay for the remediation of certain environmental conditions existing at the 
time we purchased the property from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (“ 
NUMMI”). In particular, we are responsible for the first $15.0 million of 
remediation costs, any remediation costs in excess of $30.0 million and any 
remediation costs incurred after 10 years from the purchase date. NUMMI is 
responsible for any remediation costs between $15.0 million and $30.0 million 
for up to 10 years after the purchase date.

Legal Proceedings

Proceedings Related to U. S. Treasury

In July 2012, SolarCity, along with other companies in the solar energy 
industry, received a subpoena from the U. S. Treasury Department’s Office of the
Inspector General to deliver certain documents in SolarCity’s possession that 
relate to SolarCity’s applications for U. S. Treasury grants. In February 2013, 
two financing funds affiliated with SolarCity filed a lawsuit in the U. S. Court
of Federal Claims against the U. S. government, seeking to recover $14.0 million
that the U. S. Treasury was obligated to pay, but failed to pay, under Section 
1603 of the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. In February 2016, 
the U. S. government filed a motion seeking leave to assert a counterclaim 
against the two plaintiff funds on the grounds that the U. S. government, in 
fact, paid them more, not less, than they were entitled to as a matter of law. 
In September 2017, SolarCity and the U. S. government reached a global 
settlement of both the investigation and SolarCity’s lawsuit. In that 
settlement, SolarCity admitted no wrongdoing and agreed to return approximately 
5% of the U. S. Treasury cash grants it had received between 2009 and 2013, 
amounting to $29.5 million. The investigation is now closed and SolarCity’s 
lawsuit has been dismissed.

Securities Litigation Relating to SolarCity’s Financial Statements and Guidance

On March 28, 2014, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in the
U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California against SolarCity 
and two of its officers. The complaint alleges violations of federal securities 
laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other relief on behalf of a 
purported class of purchasers of SolarCity’s securities fromMarch 6, 2013 to 
March 18, 2014. After a series of amendments to the original complaint, the 
District Court dismissed the amended complaint and entered a judgment in our 
favor on August 9, 2016. The plaintiffs have filed a notice of appeal. On 
December 4, 2017, the District Court heard oral arguments on the plaintiffs’ 
notice of appeal from the dismissal. We believe that the claims are without 
merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit and appeal vigorously. We are 
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with 
this lawsuit.

On August 15, 2016, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in 
the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California against 
SolarCity, two of its officers and a former officer. On March 20, 2017, the 
purported stockholder class filed a consolidated complaint that includes the 
original matter in the same court against SolarCity, one of its officers and 
three former officers. As consolidated, the complaint alleges that SolarCity 
made projections of future sales and installations that it failed to achieve and
that these projections were fraudulent when made. The suit claimed violations of
federal securities laws and sought unspecified compensatory damages and other 
relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of SolarCity’s securities 
from May 6, 2015 to May 9, 2016. On July 25, 2017, the court took SolarCity’s 
fully-briefed motion to dismiss under submission. On August 11, 2017, the court 
granted the motion to dismiss with leave to amend. On September 11, 2017, after 
lead plaintiff determined he would not amend, the Court dismissed the action 
with prejudice and entered judgment in favor of SolarCity and the individual 
defendants.

Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the 
Court of Chancery of the State of Delaware by purported stockholders of Tesla 
challenging the SolarCity acquisition. Following consolidation, the lawsuit 
names as defendants our board of directors and alleges, among other things, that
they breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The 
complaint asserts both derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a 
purported class and seeks, among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, 
attorneys’ fees and costs. On January 27, 2017, the defendants filed a motion to
dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, 
the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On March 17, 2017, the defendants 
filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court
heard oral arguments on the motion and reserved decision. The plaintiffs filed a
parallel action in the U. S. District Court for the District of Delaware on 
April 21, 2017, adding claims for violations of federal securities laws.

On February 6, 2017, a purported stockholder made a demand to inspect our books 
and records, purportedly to investigate potential breaches of fiduciary duties 
in connection with the SolarCity acquisition. On April 17, 2017, the purported 
stockholder filed a petition for a writ of mandate in the California Superior 
Court, seeking to compel us to provide the documents requested in the demand. We
filed a demurrer to the writ petition or, in the alternative, a motion to stay 
the action. On November 9, 2017, the Superior Court granted our motion and 
dismissed the action without prejudice.

On March 24, 2017, another lawsuit was filed in the U. S. District Court for the
District of Delaware by a purported Tesla stockholder challenging the SolarCity 
acquisition. The complaint alleges, among other things, that our board of 
directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition and
alleges violations of federal securities laws.

We believe that the claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without 
merit. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, 
associated with these lawsuits.

Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles

On October 10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action lawsuit was filed in 
the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California against us, two
of our current officers and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations 
of federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other 
relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from May
4, 2016 to October 6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that we supposedly made 
materially false and misleading statements regarding our preparedness to produce
Model 3 vehicles. We believe that the claims are without merit and intend to 
defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible 
loss or range of loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

Other Matters

From time to time, we have received requests for information from regulators and
governmental authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety 
Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board and the Securities and 
Exchange Commission. We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and 
claims that arise from the normal course of business activities. If an 
unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material 
adverse impact on our results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial 
position and brand.

Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns

We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any 
losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from 
reductions in U. S. Treasury grants or ITCs. Generally, such obligations would 
arise as a result of reductions to the value of the underlying solar energy 
systems as assessed by the U. S. Treasury Department for purposes of claiming U.
S. Treasury grants or as assessed by the IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or U.
S. Treasury grants. For each balance sheet date, we assess and recognize, when 
applicable, a distribution payable for the potential exposure from this 
obligation based on all the information available at that time, including any 
guidelines issued by the U. S. Treasury Department on solar energy system 
valuations for purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants and any audits 
undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any payments to the fund investors in 
excess of the amounts already recognized by us, which were immaterial, for this 
obligation are not probable based on the facts known at the filing date.

The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this 
obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar 
energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the 
values that the U. S. Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the 
systems for purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants or the values the IRS 
would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs 
or U. S. Treasury grants. We claim U. S. Treasury grants based on guidelines 
provided by the U. S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the
IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent 
third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs 
that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot 
determine future revisions to U. S. Treasury Department guidelines governing 
solar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in 
claiming ITCs or U. S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably estimate the 
maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this 
obligation as of each balance sheet date.

We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are 
associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can 
be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or 
the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one 
state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the 
tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives 
received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the 
contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to 
indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in 
the amount of state or local incentives actually received.

We are contractually obligated to make payments to one fund investor if the fund
investor does not achieve a specified minimum internal rate of return. The fund 
investor has already received a significant portion of the projected economic 
benefits from U. S. Treasury grant distributions and tax depreciation benefits. 
The contractual provisions of the fund state that the fund has an indefinite 
term unless the members agree to dissolve the fund. Based on our current 
financial projections regarding the amounts and timing of future distributions 
to the fund investor, we do not expect to make any payments as a result of this 
guarantee and have not accrued any liabilities for this guarantee. The amounts 
of any potential future payments under this guarantee are dependent on the 
amounts and timing of future distributions to the fund investor, future tax 
benefits that accrue to the fund investor, our purchase of the fund investor’s 
interest in the fund and future distributions to the fund investor upon the 
liquidation of the fund. Due to the uncertainties surrounding estimating the 
amounts and timing of these factors, we are unable to estimate the maximum 
potential payments under this guarantee. To date, the fund investor has achieved
the specified minimum internal rate of return.

Our lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset 
mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy systems in a 
fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to refund master lease 
prepayments previously received from investors. Any refunds of master lease 
prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2017, we had $138.2 million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
