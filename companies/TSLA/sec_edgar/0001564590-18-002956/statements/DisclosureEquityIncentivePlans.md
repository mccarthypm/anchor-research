| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 15 - Equity Incentive Plans

In 2010, we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”). The 2010 
Plan provides for the granting of stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights 
to our employees, directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 
2010 Plan may be either incentive stock options or nonqualified stock options. 
Incentive stock options may only be granted to our employees. Nonqualified stock
options may be granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, 
our stock options and RSUs vest over up to four years and are exercisable over a
maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates 
when the employment or consulting relationship ends. In addition, as a result of
our acquisition of SolarCity, we assumed its equity award plans and its 
outstanding equity awards as of the Acquisition Date. SolarCity’s outstanding 
equity awards were converted into equity awards to acquire our common stock in 
share amounts and prices based on the Exchange Ratio, with the equity awards 
retaining the same vesting and other terms and conditions as in effect 
immediately prior to the acquisition. The vesting and other terms and conditions
of the assumed equity awards are substantially the same as those of the 2010 
Plan.

As of December 31, 2017, 7,045,637 shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2010 Plan.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity:

2017, 2016 and 2015 was $491.0 million, $203.9 million and $94.5 million,

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model and the weighted-average assumptions in the following table:

The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair 
market value of our common stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U.
S. Treasury yield for zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities 
approximating each grant’s expected life. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, 
given our then limited history with employee grants, we used the “simplified” 
method in estimating the expected term of our employee grants; the simplified 
method utilizes the average of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of 
the employee grant. Beginning with the fourth quarter of 2017, we use our 
historical data in estimating the expected term of our employee grants. The 
expected volatility is based on the average of the implied volatility of 
publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical volatility of 
our common stock.

2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in 
the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of 
our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees 
(excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 1,073,000 shares of our common 
stock. Each award consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the 
vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance 
milestones, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date:

  1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production 
vehicle;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 
vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production 
vehicle; and  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater
than 30% for any three-year period.  

As of December 31, 2017, the following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period.  

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance 
milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2017, we had 
unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $13.1 million for the 
performance milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the 
years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded stock-based 
compensation expense of $6.8 million, $25.3 million and $10.4 million, 
respectively, related to these awards.

2012 CEO Award

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock option awards to 
our CEO (the “2012 CEO Grant”). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of 10 vesting 
tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both 
performance conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and 
service through each vesting date. Each vesting tranche requires a combination 
of a pre-determined performance milestone and an incremental increase in our 
market capitalization of $4.00 billion, as compared to our initial market 
capitalization of $3.20 billion at the time of grant. As of December 31, 2017, 
the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting tranches and the 
following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and  

  Aggregate production of 200,000 vehicles.  

As of December 31, 2017, the following performance milestone was considered 
probable of achievement:

  Aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles.  

We begin recognizingstock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2017, the unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense for the performance milestone that was considered probable 
of achievement was immaterial. As of December 31, 2017, we had unrecognized 
stock-based compensation expense of $5.7 million for the performance milestone 
that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended December 
31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $5.1 
million, $15.8 million and $10.6 million, respectively, related to the 2012 CEO 
Grant.

OurCEOearns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage 
requirements under California law, and he is subject to income taxes based on 
such base salary. However, he has never accepted and currently does not 
accepthissalary.

Summary Stock-Based Compensation Information

The following table summarizes our stock-based compensation expense by line item
in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):

$         334,225      $         197,999  

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the 
periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances. As of 
December 31, 2017, we had $1.34 billion of total unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we issued 370,173, 
321,788 and 220,571 shares under the ESPP for $71.0 million, $51.7 million and 
$37.5 million, respectively. There were 1,423,978 shares available for issuance 
under the ESPP as of December 31, 2017.
