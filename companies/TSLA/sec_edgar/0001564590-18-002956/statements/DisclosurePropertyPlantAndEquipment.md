Construction in progress is primarily comprised of tooling and equipment related
to the manufacturing of our vehicles and a portion of Gigafactory 1 
construction. In addition, construction in progress also included certain 
build-to-suit lease costs incurred at our Buffalo manufacturing facility, 
referred to as Gigafactory 2. Completed assets are transferred to their 
respective asset classes, and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its
intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized during periods of 
significant capital asset construction and amortized over the useful lives of 
the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, we 
capitalized $124.9 million and $46.7 million, respectively, of interest.

As of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the table above included $1.63 
billion and $1.32 billion, respectively, of build-to-suit lease assets. As of 
December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016, the corresponding financing liabilities
of $14.9 million and $3.8 million, respectively, were recorded in accrued 
liabilities and $1.67 billion and $1.32 billion, respectively, were recorded in 
other long-term liabilities.

Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2017, 
2016 and 2015 was $769.3 million, $477.3 million and $278.7 million, 
respectively. Gross property and equipment under capital leases as of December 
31, 2017 and December 31, 2016 was $688.3 million and $112.6 million, 
respectively. Accumulated depreciation on property and equipment under capital 
leases as of these dates was $100.6 million and $40.2 million, respectively.

We had cumulatively capitalized costs of $3.15 billion and $1.04 billion, 
respectively, for Gigafactory 1 as of December 31, 2017 and December 31, 2016.
