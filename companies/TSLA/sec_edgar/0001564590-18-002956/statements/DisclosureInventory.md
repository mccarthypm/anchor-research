Finished goods inventory included vehicles in transit to fulfill customer 
orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale at our retail and service 
center locations, used Tesla vehicles and energy storage products.

For solar energy systems, leased and to be leased, we commence transferring 
component parts from inventory to construction in progress, a component of solar
energy systems, leased and to be leased, once a lease contract with a customer 
has been executed and installation has been initiated. Additional costs incurred
on the leased systems, including labor and overhead, are recorded within 
construction in progress.

We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we 
believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying 
value. During the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded 
write-downs of $124.1 million, $52.8 million and $44.9 million, respectively, in
cost of revenues.
