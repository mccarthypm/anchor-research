We have a 401(k) savings plan that qualifies as a deferred salary arrangement 
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) savings 
plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of their 
eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Participants are fully 
vested in their contributions. We did not make any contributions to the 401(k) 
savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015.
