Basis of Presentation and Preparation

Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“ GAAP”) and 
reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we 
have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ ASC”) 810, Consolidation, we consolidate 
any variable interest entity (“ VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. 
We form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in
order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes 
associated with solar energy systems. The typical condition for a controlling 
financial interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an
entity; however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, 
such as VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting 
interests. ASC 810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if 
that party has the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most 
significantly impact the VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb
losses of the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right 
to receive benefits from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the 
VIE. We do not consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest 
when we are not considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we 
are the primary beneficiary of a number of VIEs (see Note18, VIE Arrangements). 
We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure 
that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions 
and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Reclassifications

Certain prior period balances have been reclassified to conform to the current 
period presentation in the consolidated financial statements and the 
accompanying notes.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Estimates are 
used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price of products and 
services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining the 
amortization period of these elements, the collectability of accounts 
receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, fair value of 
financial instruments, residual value of operating lease vehicles, depreciable 
lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems, fair value and 
residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases, warranty liabilities, 
income taxes, contingencies, the accrued liability for solar energy system 
performance guarantees, determining lease pass-through financing obligations, 
the discount rates used to determine the fair value of investment tax credits, 
the valuation of build-to-suit lease assets, fair value of interest rate swaps 
and inputs used to value stock-based compensation. In addition, estimates and 
assumptions are used for the accounting for business combinations, including the
fair values and useful lives of acquired assets, assumed liabilities and 
noncontrolling interests. Management bases its estimates on historical 
experience and on various other assumptions believed to be reasonable, the 
results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values 
of assets and liabilities. Actual results could differ from those estimates.

Summary of Significant Accounting Policies

Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue for products and services when: (i) a persuasive evidence 
of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no 
uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) pricing or fees are fixed or 
determinable and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.

Automotive Revenue

Automotive revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles, 
sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and specific other
elements that meet the definition of a deliverable under multiple-element 
accounting guidance, including free internet connectivity, free access to our 
Supercharger network and future free over-the-air software updates. These other 
elements are valued on a stand-alone basis, and we recognize their revenue over 
our performance period, which is generally the eight-year life of the vehicle, 
except for internet connectivity, which is over the free four-year period. If we
sell a deliverable separately, we use that pricing to determine its fair value; 
otherwise, we use our best estimated selling price by considering costs used to 
develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing of similar options and 
other information that may be available. At the time of revenue recognition, we 
record a reserve against revenue for estimated future product returns. Such 
estimates are based on historical experience and are immaterial in all periods 
presented. In addition, any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s 
lender, when we arrange the financing, would be recognized as an offset against 
automotive sales revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-50, Customer Payments and 
Incentives.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had deferred $498.9 million and $291.2 
million, respectively, related to the purchase of vehicle maintenance and 
service plans, access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, 
autopilot and over-the-air software updates.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting 
guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as programs with resale value 
guarantees. See “ Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee,” “ 
Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee” and “ Direct 
Vehicle Leasing Program” for further details.

Resale Value Guarantees and Other Financing Programs

Vehicle sales to customers with a resale value guarantee

Prior to June 30, 2016, we offered resale value guarantees or similar buy-back 
terms to all customers who purchased vehicles and who financed their vehicles 
through one of our specified commercial banking partners. Since June 30, 2016, 
this program is available only in certain international markets. Under this 
program, customers have the option of selling their vehicle back to us during 
the guarantee period, which currently is generally at the end of the term of the
applicable loan or financing program, for a determined resale value. Although we
receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time of delivery, we are
required to account for these transactions as operating leases. The amount of 
sale proceeds equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the 
guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to 
automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the 
end of the guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize 
the cost of these vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease 
vehicles, net, and depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of 
automotive leasing revenue over the same period.

In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the 
guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining 
deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive 
leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us 
during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an 
amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred 
balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of 
the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle inventory. As of 
December 31, 2017 and 2016, $375.7 million and $179.5 million, respectively, of 
the guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next 12 months.

Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee

We also offer resale value guarantees in connection with automobile sales to 
certain leasing partners. As we have guaranteed the value of these vehicles and 
as the vehicles are leased to end-customers, we account for these transactions 
as interest bearing collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases.
Under this program, cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is 
recorded within resale value guarantees for the long-term portion and deferred 
revenue for the current portion. We accrete the deferred revenue amount to 
automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the guarantee period 
and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles 
under this program to operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance
sheet, and we record depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive 
leasing revenue during the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash
received for these vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is 
classified as collateralized lease borrowings within cash flows from financing 
activities in the consolidated statement of cash flows.

At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either 
purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the resale value guarantee 
amount or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may 
realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred 
revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing 
revenue. In cases where the leasing partner retains ownership of the vehicle 
after the end of our guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased 
vehicle to cost of automotive leasing revenue. The maximum amount we could be 
required to pay under this program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles,
was $742.9 million and $855.9million as of December 31, 2017 and 2016, 
respectively, including $411.6 million within a 12-month period from December 
31, 2017.

As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had$1.64 billionand $1.18billion of such 
borrowings recorded in resale value guarantees and $339.5 million and 
$289.1million recorded in deferred revenue liability, respectively. As of 
December31, 2017 and 2016, we had a total of $26.2 million and $57.0 million, 
respectively, in accounts receivable from our leasing partners.

On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under 
our resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on 
any of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values 
of our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be material changes to
their estimated values.

Activity related to our resale value guarantee and similar programs consisted of

Direct Vehicle Leasing Program

We offer a vehicle leasing program in certain locations in the North America and
Europe. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from 
Tesla for up to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the 
option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a 
pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as 
operating leases, and we recognize leasing revenues on a straight-line basis 
over the contractual term and record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost 
of automotive leasing revenue. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had deferred
$96.6 million and $67.2 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments
which will be recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual term of 
the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded in automotive leasing 
revenue, and for the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recognized
$220.6 million, $112.7 million and $41.2 million, respectively.

Regulatory Credits

California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle 
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in 
that state during each model year are zero-emission vehicles. These laws and 
regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero-emission vehicles may earn 
regulatory credits (“ ZEV credits”) and may sell excess credits to other 
manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory 
requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require 
compliance related to greenhouse gas (“ GHG”) emissions and also allow for the 
sale of excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a 
manufacturer solely of zero-emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, 
such as ZEV and GHG credits, on our vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn 
these credits in the future. We enter into contractual agreements with 
third-parties to purchase our regulatory credits.

We recognize revenue on the sale of regulatory credits at the time legal title 
to the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as automotive 
revenue in the consolidated statement of operations. Revenue from the sale of 
regulatory credits totaled $360.3 million, $302.3 million and $168.7 million for
the years ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Additionally, we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and 
Storey County in Nevada that will provide abatements for sales, use, real 
property, personal property and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base 
tariff energy rates and transferable tax credits. These incentives are available
for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on June 30, 
2034, subject to capital investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory 1 of
at least $3.50 billion in the aggregate on or before June 30, 2024, which were 
met as of December 31, 2017, and certain other conditions specified in the 
agreements. If we do not satisfy one or more conditions under the agreement, we 
would be required to repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of 
the tax incentives incurred plus interest. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we 
had earned $163.0 million and $45 million, respectively, of transferable tax 
credits under these agreements. We record these credits as earned when we have 
evidence there is a market for their sale. Credits are applied as a cost offset 
to either employee expense or to capital assets, depending on the source of the 
credits. Credits earned from employee hires or capital spending by our partners 
at Gigafactory 1 are recorded as a reduction to operating expenses.

Service and Other Revenue

Service and other revenue consists of repair and maintenance services, service 
plans, merchandise, sales of used Tesla vehicles, sales of electric vehicle 
powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers and sales of non-Tesla 
vehicle trade-ins.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

For solar energy systems and components sales wherein customers pay the full 
purchase price, either directly or through the solar loan program, revenue is 
recognized when we install a solar energy system and the solar energy system 
passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction, provided 
all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. In instances where there 
are multiple deliverables in a single arrangement, we allocate the arrangement 
consideration to the various elements in the arrangement based on the relative 
selling price method. Costs incurred on residential installations before the 
solar energy systems are completed are included in inventories as 
work-in-progress in the consolidated balance sheet. However, any fees that are 
paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an offset 
against energy generation and storage revenue, in accordance with ASC 605-50, 
Customer Payments and Incentives. Revenue from an energy storage product sale is
recognized when the product has been delivered, installed and accepted by the 
customer, provided all other revenue recognition criteria have been met.

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements for solar energy systems, including energy storage products, we 
record lease revenue from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and 
incentives earned from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of 
the lease term, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. 
For incentives that are earned based on the amount of electricity generated by 
the system, we record revenue as the amounts are earned. The difference between 
the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue
on the consolidated balance sheet.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under 
power purchase agreements, we have determined that these agreements should be 
accounted for, in substance, as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is
recognized based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under
the contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized. Deferred revenue 
also includes the portion of rebates and incentives received from utility 
companies and various local and state government agencies, which are recognized 
as revenue over the lease term, as well as the fees charged for remote 
monitoring service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective 
customer contract term. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, deferred revenue 
related to such customer payments amounted to $320.0 million and $268.2 million,
respectively. As of December 31, 2017 and 2016, deferred revenue from rebates 
and incentives was not material.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the origination of solar energy system 
leases or power purchase agreements (i. e. the incremental cost of contract 
administration, referral fees and sales commissions) as an element of solar 
energy systems, leased and to be leased, net, and subsequently amortize these 
costs over the term of the related lease or power purchase agreement.

Cost of Revenue

Automotive

Cost of automotive revenue includes direct parts, material and labor costs, 
manufacturing overhead (including amortized tooling costs), shipping and 
logistic costs, vehicle internet connectivity costs, allocations of electricity 
and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network and reserves for 
estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive revenue also includes 
adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write-down the carrying value of 
our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to provide 
for on-hand inventory that is either obsolete or in excess of forecasted demand.

Automotive Leasing

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of 
operating lease vehicles over the lease term as well as warranty expenses 
recognized as incurred.

Service and Other

Cost of service and other revenue includes direct parts, material and labor 
costs, manufacturing overhead associated with sales of electric vehicle 
powertrain components and systems to other manufacturers, costs associated with 
providing maintenance and development services and costs associated with sales 
of used vehicles.

Energy Generation and Storage

Energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect 
material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other 
overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In 
addition, where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases, the cost of 
revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar 
energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization
of any initial direct costs.

Sales and Other Use Taxes

Taxes assessed by various government entities, such as sales, use and value 
added taxes, collected at the time of sale are excluded from automotive net 
sales and revenue.

Transportation Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as 
automotive revenue, and the related transportation costs are included in cost of
automotive revenue.

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs

Marketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are 
included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the 
consolidated statement of operations. We incurred marketing, promotional and 
advertising costs of $66.5 million, $48.0 million and $58.3 million in the years
ended December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, respectively.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other 
comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensiveincome(loss) consists of 
unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and available-for-sale 
marketable securities and foreign currency translation adjustments that have 
been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).

Stock-Based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (“ RSUs”) and our employee stock
purchase plan (the “ ESPP”). The fair value of stock options and the ESPP is 
estimated on the grant or offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing
fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of 
actual forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected 
forfeitures). Stock-based compensation associated with awards assumed from the 
acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“ SolarCity”) is measured as of the 
acquisition date using the relevant assumptions and recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the remaining requisite service period, net of actual 
forfeitures in the period (prior to 2017, net of estimated projected 
forfeitures).

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on
the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based 
compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market 
conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance
and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant 
performance condition is considered probable of achievement. The fair value of 
such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo simulations (see 
Note15, Equity Incentive Plans).

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and 
vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual 
provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We 
have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the 
noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that 
reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach
using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“ HLBV”) method. We, 
therefore, determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable 
noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet 
date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet
as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as 
noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the 
consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would 
hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation 
provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at
their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws 
effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The 
third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are 
determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable 
noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the 
start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital 
transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable 
noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The 
redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in 
the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these 
third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or 
other assets.

Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common 
stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the 
period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average 
shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and 
convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted 
method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) 
per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect 
is dilutive. Since we expect to settle in cash the principal outstanding under 
the 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, the 1.25% Convertible Senior 
Notes due in 2021 and the 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022, we use 
the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, if 
any. The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were 
excluded from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common 
stock attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was 
anti-dilutive:

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents 
are primarily comprised of money market funds.

Restricted Cash and Deposits

We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our 
restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to 
lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate 
leases, insurance policies, credit card borrowing facilities and certain 
operating leases. In addition, restricted cash includes cash received from 
certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held 
to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities.

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for DoubtfulAccounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain 
systems, sales of energy generation and storage products, receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, sales of regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers 
and maintenance services on vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an 
allowance against accounts receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will 
be collected. We write-off accounts receivable when they are deemed 
uncollectible.

We typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle
and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery, except
for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing 
arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions.

MyPower Customer Notes Receivable

We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower
was offered by SolarCity to provide residential customers with the option to 
finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The 
outstanding balances, net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible 
amounts, are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of 
prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as MyPower
customer notes receivable, net of current portion, for the long-term portion. In
determining the allowance and credit quality for customer notes receivable, we 
identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and also
consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that 
might impact the level of future credit losses. Customer notes receivable that 
are individually impaired are charged-off as a write-off of the allowance for 
losses. Since acquisition, there have been no new significant customers with 
known disputes or collection issues, and the amount of potentially uncollectible
amounts has been insignificant. Accordingly, we did not establish an allowance 
for losses against customer notes receivable. In addition, there were no 
material non-accrual or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31, 
2017.

Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable and
interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are primarily invested in money market 
funds or on deposit at high credit quality financial institutions in the U. S. 
At times, these deposits may be in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 
2017, no entity represented 10% or more of our total accounts receivable 
balance. As of December 31, 2016, one entity represented approximately 10% of 
our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our 
interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated 
multinational banks.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source 
suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components 
of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes 
acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from 
these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is 
computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which 
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for 
solar energy systems are recorded using actual cost. We record inventory 
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about on 
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of 
our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the
net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us 
to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost
to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A
small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported 
financial results.

Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles delivered under our resale value guarantee program, vehicles that are 
leased as part of our leasing programs as well as any vehicles that are sold 
with a significant buy-back guarantee are classified as operating lease vehicles
as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases. Operating 
lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation 
is computed using the straight-line method over the expected operating lease 
term. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated 
balance sheets as of December 31, 2017 and 2016 was $4.85 billion and $3.53 
billion, respectively. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of
December 31, 2017, and 2016 was $733.3 million and $399.5 million, respectively.

Solar Energy Systems, Leased and To Be Leased

We are the lessor of solar energy systems under leases that qualify as operating
leases. Our leases are accounted for in accordance with ASC 840. To determine 
lease classification, we evaluate the lease terms to determine whether there is 
a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option at the end of the lease, 
whether the lease term is greater than 75% of the useful life or whether the 
present value of the minimum lease payments exceed 90% of the fair value at 
lease inception. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and 
fair values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination. Solar 
energy systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems leased to customers            30 to 35 years            
  Initial direct costs related to customer solar      Lease term (up to 25 
years)  

Solar energy systems held for lease to customers are installed systems pending 
interconnection with the respective utility companies and will be depreciated as
solar energy systems leased to customers when they have been interconnected and 
placed in-service. Solar energy systems under construction represents systems 
that are under installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems 
leased to customers when they are completed, interconnected and leased to 
customers. Initial direct costs related to customer solar energy system lease 
acquisition costs are capitalized and amortized over the term of the related 
customer lease agreements.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment, including leasehold improvements, are recognized 
at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization. Depreciation is 
generally computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful 
lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and office      2 to 12 years   
  Building and building improvements             15 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software                3 to 10 years   

Depreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method 
whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life
of the respective assets. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated productive life
for Model S and X tooling was 250,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of
production. As of December 31, 2017, the estimated productive life for Model 3 
tooling was 1,000,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production.

Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance 
sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement
of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified 
useful life.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on 
construction-in-progress is included within property, plant and equipment and is
amortized over the life of the related assets.

Furthermore, we are deemed to be the owner, for accounting purposes, during the 
construction phase of certain long-lived assets under build-to-suit lease 
arrangements because of our involvement with the construction, our exposure to 
any potential cost overruns or our other commitments under the arrangements. In 
these cases, we recognize build-to-suit lease assets under construction and 
corresponding build-to-suit lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet,
in accordance with ASC 840. Once construction is completed, if a lease meets 
certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we remove the asset and liability and account
for the lease as an operating lease. Otherwise, the lease is accounted for as a 
capital lease.

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review our property, plant and equipment, long-term prepayments and 
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be 
recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the 
future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the 
asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted-down to its fair
value. We have recognized no material impairments of our long-lived assets in 
any of the periods presented.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from two to thirty years.

Capitalization of Software Costs

For costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs 
incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary 
project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. 
Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful life of three to ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets 
on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U. S. 
dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the 
different rates we apply to accumulated deficits, including current period 
income or loss, and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly
average functional currency rate to its income or loss and the month-end 
functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.

Beginning on January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign 
subsidiaries was changed to their local country’s currency. This change was 
based on the culmination of facts and circumstances that had developed as we 
expanded our foreign operations. The adjustment of $10.0 million attributable to
the translation of non-monetary assets and liabilities as of the date of change 
is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the consolidated balance 
sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income
(expense), net, on the consolidated statement of operations. For the years ended
December 31, 2017, 2016 and 2015, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains
(losses) of $52.3 million, $26.1 million and ($45.6) million, respectively.

Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles, production 
powertrain components and systems and energy products we sell. In addition, we 
also provide a warranty on the installation and components of the solar energy 
systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 30 years. We accrue a 
warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate 
of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranty. These 
estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an estimate of the 
nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently 
uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and changes to our 
historical or projected warranty experience may cause material changes to the 
warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not include projected 
warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease accounting and our 
solar energy systems under lease contracts or power purchase agreements, as the 
costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of 
the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is 
included within accrued liabilities and other while the remaining balance is 
included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues. Accrued 
warranty activity consisted of the following (in thousands):

For the years ended December 31, 2017 and 2016, warranty costs incurred for 
vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt arrangements 
were $35.5 million and $19.0 million, respectively.

Solar Energy Systems Performance Guarantees

We guarantee certain specified minimum solar energy production output for 
certain solar energy systems leased or sold to customers, generally for a term 
of up to 30 years. We monitor the solar energy systems to ensure that these 
outputs are being achieved. We evaluate if any amounts are due to our customers 
and make any payments periodically as specified in the customer agreements. As 
of December 31, 2017 and 2016, we had recognized a liability of $6.3 million and
$6.6 million, respectively, within accrued liabilities and other on the 
consolidated balance sheets, related to these guarantees based on our assessment
of the exposure.

Solar Renewable Energy Credits

We account for solar renewable energy credits (“ SRECs”) when they are purchased
by us or sold to third-parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy systems 
owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any 
specifically identifiable costs for those SRECs as there are no specific 
incremental costs incurred to generate the SRECs. For SRECs purchased by us, we 
record these SRECs at their cost, subject to impairment testing. We recognize 
revenue from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is transferred to the buyer, and 
the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to cost of revenue.

Deferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue

We have solar energy systems that are eligible for investment tax credits (“ 
ITCs”) that accrue to eligible property under the Internal Revenue Code (“ 
IRC”). Under Section 50(d)(5) of the IRC and the related regulations, a lessor 
of qualifying property may elect to treat the lessee as the owner of such 
property for the purposes of claiming the ITCs associated with such property. 
These regulations enable the ITCs to be separated from the ownership of the 
property and allow the transfer of the ITCs. Under our lease pass-through fund 
arrangements, we can make a tax election to pass-through the ITCs to the 
investors, who are the legal lessee of the property. Therefore, we are able to 
monetize these ITCs to the investors who can utilize them in return for cash 
payments. We consider the monetization of ITCs to constitute one of the key 
elements of realizing the value associated with solar energy systems. 
Consequently, we consider the proceeds from the monetization of ITCs to be a 
component of revenue generated from solar energy systems.

In accordance with the relevant FASB guidance, we recognize revenue from the 
monetization of ITCs when (1) persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists, (2) 
delivery has occurred or services have been rendered, (3) the sales price is 
fixed or determinable and (4) collection of the related receivable is reasonably
assured. An ITC is subject to recapture under the IRC if the underlying solar 
energy system either ceases to be a qualifying property or undergoes a change in
ownership within five years of its placed-in-service date; the recapture amount 
decreases on each anniversary of the placed-in-service date. Since we have an 
obligation to ensure that the solar energy system is in-service and operational 
for a term of five years in order to avoid any recapture of the ITC, we 
recognize revenue as the recapture amount decreases, assuming the other revenue 
recognition criteria above have been met. As a result, the monetized ITC is 
initially recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance sheets, and 
subsequently, one-fifth of the monetized ITC is recognized as energy generation 
and storage revenue on the consolidated statement of operations on each 
anniversary of the solar energy system’s placed-in-service date over five years.

We indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our non-compliance. 
We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture event is remote, and 
consequently, we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the
consolidated balance sheets.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board (“ FASB”) issued 
Accounting Standards Update (“ ASU”) No. 2014-09, Revenue from Contracts with 
Customers, to replace the existing revenue recognition criteria for contracts 
with customers. In August 2015, the FASB issued ASU No. 2015-14, Deferral of the
Effective Date, to defer the effective date of ASU No. 2014-09 to interim and 
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Subsequently, the FASB issued 
ASU No. 2016-08, Principal versus Agent Considerations, ASU No. 2016-10, 
Identifying Performance Obligations and Licensing, ASU No. 2016-11, Rescission 
of SEC Guidance Because of Accounting Standards Updates 2014-09 and 2014-16 
Pursuant to Staff Announcements at the March 3, 2016 EITF Meeting, ASU No. 
2016-12, Narrow-Scope Improvements and Practical Expedients, and ASU No. 
2016-20, Technical Corrections and Improvements, to clarify and amend the 
guidance in ASU No. 2014-09. We will adopt the ASUs on January 1, 2018 on a 
modified retrospective basis through a cumulative adjustment to accumulated 
deficit. The adoption of the ASUs will accelerate the revenue recognition of 
certain vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value 
guarantee, which will therefore qualify to be accounted for as sales with a 
right of return as opposed to the current accounting as operating leases or 
collateralized lease borrowings. Our interpretation is subject to change as a 
result of future changes in market conditions, incentives or program offerings. 
Upon adoption of the ASUs, we currently estimate a decrease to our beginning 
accumulated deficit in the range of $520.0 million to $570.0 million before 
income tax effects (which are still being assessed), including the impact of 
adjusting deferred revenue for ITC balances, as of January 1, 2018. We are 
continuing to assess the impact of adopting the ASUs on the consolidated 
financial statements, and we are continuing to adjust our accounting policies, 
operational and financial reporting processes, systems and related internal 
controls accordingly.

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to require lessees to
recognize all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance sheet, while 
recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to current lease 
accounting. The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies
certain aspects of lessor accounting. The ASU is effective for interim and 
annual periods beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted.
We currently expect to adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019. We will be required to 
recognize and measure leases existing at, or entered into after, the beginning 
of the earliest comparative period presented using a modified retrospective 
approach, with certain practical expedients available. We intend to elect the 
available practical expedients upon adoption. Upon adoption, we expect the 
consolidated balance sheet to include a right of use asset and liability related
to substantially all of our lease arrangements. We are continuing to assess the 
impact of adopting the ASU on our financial position, results of operations and 
related disclosures and have not yet concluded whether the effect on the 
consolidated financial statements will be material.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-06, Contingent Put and Call Options 
in Debt Instruments, to clarify when a contingent put or call option to 
accelerate the repayment of debt is an embedded derivative. The ASU is effective
for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2016. Adoption of 
the ASU is modified retrospective. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2017, but 
the ASU did not have an impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In March 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-09, Improvements to Employee 
Share-Based Payment Accounting, to simplify the accounting for the income tax 
effects from share-based compensation, the accounting for forfeitures and the 
accounting for statutory income tax withholding, among others. In particular, 
the ASU requires all income tax effects from share-based compensation to be 
recognized in the consolidated statement of operations when the awards vest or 
are settled, the ASU permits accounting for forfeitures as they occur, and the 
ASU permits a higher level of statutory income tax withholding without 
triggering liability accounting. Adoption of the ASU is modified retrospective, 
retrospective and prospective, depending on the specific provision being 
adopted. We adopted the ASU on January 1, 2017, which increased our beginning 
accumulated deficit and additional paid-in capital by $15.7 million. 
Furthermore, our gross U. S. deferred tax assets increased by $909.1 million, 
which was fully offset by a corresponding increase to our valuation allowance, 
upon adoption. In addition, beginning on January 1, 2017, we account for 
forfeitures as they occur.

In August 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-15, Classification of Certain Cash 
Receipts and Cash Payments, to reduce the diversity in practice with respect to 
the classification of certain cash receipts and cash payments on the statement 
of cash flows. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning 
after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is retrospective. We will adopt the
ASU on January 1, 2018, which will impact the classifications within the 
consolidated statement of cash flows.

In October 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-16, Intra-Entity Transfers of 
Assets Other Than Inventory, to require the recognition of the income tax 
effects from an intra-entity transfer of an asset other than inventory. The ASU 
is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
Adoption of the ASU is modified retrospective. We early adopted the ASU on 
January 1, 2017. Our adoption did not have a material impact on the consolidated
financial statements.

In November 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-18, Statement of Cash Flows: 
Restricted Cash, which requires entities to present the aggregate changes in 
cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents in the 
statement of cash flows. As a result, the statement of cash flows will be 
required to present restricted cash and restricted cash equivalents as a part of
the beginning and ending balances of cash and cash equivalents. The ASU is 
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
Adoption of the ASU is retrospective. We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2018, 
which will result in restricted cash being combined with unrestricted cash 
reconciling beginning and ending balances.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-01, Clarifying the Definition of a
Business, to clarify the definition of a business with the objective of 
assisting entities with evaluating whether transactions should be accounted for 
as acquisitions (or disposals) of assets or businesses. The ASU is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. Adoption of the 
ASU is prospective. We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2018, which we 
anticipate will result in more transactions being accounted for as asset 
acquisitions rather than business acquisitions.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for 
Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing 
Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by 
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount, 
recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount 
exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to 
the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative 
assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The 
ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 
2019, with early adoption permitted for interim or annual goodwill impairment 
tests performed on testing dates after January 1, 2017. Adoption of the ASU is 
prospective. We have not yet selected an adoption date, and the ASU currently 
has an undetermined impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In May 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-09, Scope of Modification Accounting, 
to provide guidance on which changes to the terms or conditions of a share-based
payment award require an entity to apply modification accounting. The ASU is 
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2017. 
Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We will adopt the ASU on January 1, 2018, 
which will have no impact on the consolidated financial statements upon 
adoption.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to 
Accounting for Hedging Activities, to simplify the application of current hedge 
accounting guidance. The ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both 
non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and 
presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
financial statements. The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods 
beginning after December 15, 2018, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of 
the ASU is generally modified retrospective. We are currently obtaining an 
understanding of the ASU and plan to adopt the ASU on January 1, 2019.
