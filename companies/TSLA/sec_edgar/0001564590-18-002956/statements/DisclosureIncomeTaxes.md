On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“ Tax Act”) was enacted 
into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes 
include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% 
to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U. S. 
international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a
one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign 
earnings. We are required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the 
period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U. S. deferred tax assets and 
liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax 
assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on 
the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to
our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our 
net U. S. deferred tax assets.

In December 2017, the Securities and Exchange Commission staff issued Staff 
Accounting Bulletin No. 118, Income Tax Accounting Implications of the Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act(“ SAB 118”), which allows us to record provisional amounts during a
measurement period not to extend beyond one year from the enactment date. Since 
the Tax Act was enacted late in the fourth quarter of 2017 (and ongoing guidance
and accounting interpretations are expected over the next 12 months), we 
consider the accounting of deferred tax re-measurements and other items, such as
state tax considerations, to be incomplete due to the forthcoming guidance and 
our ongoing analysis of final year-end data and tax positions. We expect to 
complete our analysis within the measurement period in accordance with SAB 118. 
We do not expect any subsequent adjustments to have any material impact on the 
consolidated balance sheets or statements of operations due to our historical 
worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our net U. S. 
deferred tax assets.

As of December 31, 2017, we recorded a valuation allowance of $1.84 billion for 
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation on our net deferred taxes increased by $821.0 million during the year 
ended December 31, 2017. The valuation allowance increase is primarily due to 
additional U. S. deferred tax assets incurred in the current year, as well as an
increase relating to adoption of ASU 2016-09, and offset by the re-measurement 
of the federal portion of our deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2017 from 
35% to the new 21% tax rate. Management believes that based on the available 
information, it is more likely than not that the U. S. deferred tax assets will 
not be realized, such that a full valuation allowance is required against all U.
S. deferred tax assets. We have net $46.5 million of deferred tax assets in 
foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be 
fully realized given the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions.

  (2)      Due to the Tax Act, our U. S. deferred tax assets and liabilities as 
of December 31, 2017 were re-measured from 35% to 21%. The change in tax rate 
resulted in a decrease to our gross U. S. defe...  

As of December 31, 2017, we had $6.42 billion of federal and $5.26 billion of 
state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable 
income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 
2028 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity 
prior to our acquisition in 2016 and, therefore, are subject to change of 
control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can 
be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control 
limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes. 
Upon the adoption of ASU 2016-09, our gross U. S. deferred tax assets increased 
by $583.4 million, inclusive of the effect for the U. S. statutory corporate tax
rate reduction from 35% to 21%, and is fully offset by a corresponding increase 
to our valuation allowance.

As of December 31, 2017, we had research and development tax credits of $209.0 
million and $223.2 million for federal and state income tax purposes, 
respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits 
will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state research 
and development tax credits can be carried-forward indefinitely. In addition, we
had other general business tax credits of $116.9 million for federal income tax 
purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.

Collectively, we had no foreign earnings as of December 31, 2017 and therefore 
was not subject to the mandatory repatriation tax provisions of the Tax Act. 
However, some of our foreign subsidiaries do have accumulated earnings. No 
deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded 
relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred 
tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change”, as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We determined 
that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net 
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership changes.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in 
thousands):

  December 31, 2014                                               41,377

  Increases in balances related to current year tax               84,352  
  Change in balances related to effect of U. S. tax law          (58,050  
  December 31, 2017                                              198,745  

As of December 31, 2017, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial. 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $191.0 million, if recognized, would not affect our
effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset 
that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance. We do not 
anticipate that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will 
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months.

We file income tax returns in the U. S., California and various state and 
foreign jurisdictions. Tax years 2004 to 2016 remain subject to examination for 
federal income tax purposes, and tax years 2004 to 2016 remain subject to 
examination for California income tax purposes. All net operating losses and tax
credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U. S. federal and 
California income tax purposes. Tax years 2008 to 2016 remain subject to 
examination in other U. S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

The U. S. Tax Court issued a decision inAltera Corp v. Commissionerrelated to 
the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing arrangement.
As this decision can be overturned upon appeal, we have not recorded any impact 
as of December 31, 2017. In addition, any potential tax benefits would increase 
our U. S. deferred tax asset, which is currently offset with a full valuation 
allowance.
