| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 13 - Equity Incentive Plans

In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 
2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock
appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, 
directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be 
either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock 
options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be 
granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock 
options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over
a maximum period of10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates
when the employment or consulting relationship ends.

As of December 31, 2021,49.0 million shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2019 Plan.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year 
ended December 31, 2021:

Tranche 8 of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which represents

8.4

million stock options, was achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021 and will vest 
upon expected certification following the filing of this Annual Report on Form 
10-K.

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs granted in the years ended 
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 was $784.00, $300.51 and $56.55, respectively. 
The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 
2021, 2020 and 2019 was $5.70 billion, $3.25 billion and $502 million, 
respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 
31, 2021, 2020, and 2019 was $26.88 billion, $1.55 billion and $237 million, 
respectively. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO exercised all of 
the remaining vested options from the 2012 CEO Performance Award, which amounted
to an intrinsic value of $23.45 billion.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we issued0.5 
million,1.8 million and2.5 million shares under the ESPP. There were33.8 million
shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2021.

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the 
grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The 
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options 
are as follows:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is 
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common 
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield for 
zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s 
expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our
employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied 
volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical 
volatility of our common stock.

2018 CEO Performance Award

In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of101.3 
million stock option awards, as adjusted to give effect to the five-for-one 
stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020 (“Stock 
Split”), to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). The 2018 CEO Performance
Award consists of12 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on 
the attainment of both operational milestones (performance conditions) and 
market conditions, assuming continued employment either as the CEO or as both 
Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and service through each vesting 
date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will 
vest upon certification by the Board of Directors that both (i) the market 
capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $ 100.0 billion for 
the first tranche and increases by increments of $ 50.0 billion thereafter 
(based on both a six calendar month trailing average and a 30 calendar day 
trailing average, counting only trading days), has been achieved, and (ii) any 
one of the following eight operational milestones focused on total revenue or 
any one of the eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA have been
achieved for the four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized basis and 
subsequently reported by us in our consolidated financial statements filed with 
our Forms 10-Q and/or 10-K. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) 
attributable to common stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit)
for income taxes, depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation. 
Upon vesting and exercise, including the payment of the exercise price of $70.01
per share, our CEO must hold shares that he acquires for five years 
post-exercise, other than a cashless exercise where shares are simultaneously 
sold to pay for the exercise price and any required tax withholding.

The achievement status of the operational milestones as of December 31, 2021 is 
provided below. Although an operational milestone is deemed achieved in the last
quarter of the relevant annualized period, it may be certified only after the 
financial statements supporting its achievement have been filed with our Forms 
10-Q and/or 10-K.

Achieved in the fourth quarter of 2021 and expected to be certified following 
the filing of this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

Stock-based compensation under the 2018 CEO Performance Award represents a 
non-cash expense and is recorded as a Selling, general, and administrative 
operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations. In each quarter 
since the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, we have recognized expense, 
generally on a pro-rated basis, for only the number of tranches (up to the 
maximum of 12 tranches) that corresponds to the number of operational milestones
that have been achieved or have been determined probable of being achieved in 
the future, in accordance with the following principles.

On the grant date, a Monte Carlo simulation was used to determine for each 
tranche (i) a fixed amount of expense for such tranche and (ii) the future time 
when the market capitalization milestone for such tranche was expected to be 
achieved, or its “expected market capitalization milestone achievement time.” 
Separately, based on a subjective assessment of our future financial 
performance, each quarter we determine whether it is probable that we will 
achieve each operational milestone that has not previously been achieved or 
deemed probable of achievement and if so, the future time when we expect to 
achieve that operational milestone, or its “expected operational milestone 
achievement time.” When we first determine that an operational milestone has 
become probable of being achieved, we allocate the entire expense for the 
related tranche over the number of quarters between the grant date and the 
then-applicable “expected full achievement time.” The “expected full achievement
time” at any given time is the later of (i) the expected operational milestone 
achievement time (if the related operational milestone has not yet been 
achieved) and (ii) the expected market capitalization milestone achievement time
(if the related market capitalization milestone had not yet been achieved). We 
immediately recognize a catch-up expense for all accumulated expense for the 
quarters from the grant date through the quarter in which the operational 
milestone was first deemed probable of being achieved. Each quarter thereafter, 
we recognize the prorated portion of the then-remaining expense for the tranche 
based on the number of quarters between such quarter and the then-applicable 
expected full achievement time, except that upon the achievement of both a 
market capitalization milestone and operational milestone with respect to a 
tranche, all remaining expense for that tranche is immediately recognized.

As a result, we have experienced significant catch-up expenses in quarters when 
one or more operational milestones were first determined to be probable of 
achievement. Historically, the expected market capitalization achievement times 
were generally later than the related expected operational milestone achievement
times. Therefore, when market capitalization milestones were achieved earlier 
than originally forecasted due to periods of rapid stock price appreciation, we 
had higher catch-up expenses and the remaining expenses were being recognized 
over shorter periods of time at a higher per-quarter rate. All market 
capitalization milestones were achieved as of the second quarter of 2021.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, five operational milestones became 
probable of achievement and consequently, we recognized an aggregate catch-up 
expense of $571 million.

As of December 31, 2021, we had$65 million of total unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense remaining, which will be recognized over a weighted-average
period of0.6 years. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we 
recorded stock-based compensation expense of$910 million, $838 million and $296 
million, respectively, related to the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

Other Performance-Based Grants

2012 CEO Performance Award

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted26.4 million stock option awards 
to our CEO (the “2012 CEO Performance Award”), as adjusted to give effect to the
Stock Split. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of10 vesting tranches with 
a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance 
conditions and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service 
through each vesting date. During the year ended December 31, 2021, our CEO 
exercised all of the remaining22.9 million vested options from the 2012 CEO 
Performance Award.

As of December 31, 2021, the performance milestone of gross margin of30% or more
for four consecutive quarters was considered not probable of achievement for 
which the unrecognized stock-based compensation is immaterial. For the years 
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we did no t record any stock-based 
compensation expense related to the 2012 CEO Performance Award.

2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in 
the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of 
our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees 
(excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of5.4 million shares of our common 
stock, as adjusted to give effect to the Stock Split. Each award consisted of 
four vesting tranches with the vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment
of the future performance milestones, assuming continued employment and service 
through each vesting date.

As of December 31, 2021, the performance milestone of annualized gross margin of
greater than30% for any three-year period was considered not probable of 
achievement for which the unrecognized stock-based compensation is immaterial. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we did no t record any 
stock-based compensation expense related to this grant.

2021 Performance-Based Stock Option & RSU Awards

During the fourth quarter of 2021, the Compensation Committee of our Board of 
Directors granted to certain employees restricted stock units and stock options 
to purchase an aggregate0.7 million shares of our common stock to create 
incentives for continued long-term success and to closely align compensation 
with our stockholders' interests in the achievement of certain performance 
milestones by our company.

We begin recording stock-based compensation expense when the performance 
milestones become probable of achievement. Following achievement, vesting occurs
over a two year period with continued employment. As of December 31, 2021, we 
had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $413 million f or this 
grant as it was not considered probable of achievement. For the year ended 
December 31, 2021, we did no t record stock-based compensation expense related 
to this grant.

each of the periods presented were immaterial due to cumulative losses and 
valuation allowances. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 
stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance sheets 
was $182 million, $89 million and $52 million, respectively. As of December 31, 
2021, we had $3.43 billion of total unrecognized stock-based compensation 
expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized over a 
weighted-average period of2.10 years.
