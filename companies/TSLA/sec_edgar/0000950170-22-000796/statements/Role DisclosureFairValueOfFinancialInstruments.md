| **  Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, 
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As 
such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based 
on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a 
liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs
should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable 
inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than 
quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or 
indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no 
market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data
when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value 
hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our 
marketable securities are classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy
and the market approach was used to determine fair value of these investments. 
Our interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value 
hierarchy because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models 
that utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest 
rates.

Interest Rate Swaps

We enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable 
interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments, as required by 
certain of our lenders. We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging 
instruments. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on 
the consolidated balance sheets within Other non-current assets or Other 
long-term liabilities, with any changes in their fair values recognized as Other
income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and with any
cash flows recognized as operating activities in the consolidated statements of 
cash flows. Our interest rate swaps outstanding were as follows (in millions):

Disclosure of Fair Values

Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include 
accounts receivable, MyPower customer notes receivable, accounts payable, 
accrued liabilities, customer deposits and debt. The carrying values of these 
financial instruments approximate their fair values, other than our1.25% 
Convertible Senior Notes due in2021(“2021Notes”),2.375% Convertible Senior Notes
due in2022(“2022Notes”),2024Notes and our subsidiary’s5.50% Convertible Senior 
Notes due in2022(collectively referred to as “Convertible Senior Notes” 
below),5.30% Senior Notes due in2025(“2025 Notes”), Solar Asset and Loan-backed 
Notes.

We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 2025 Notes 
using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and market-based risk 
measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit risk (Level II). In 
addition, we estimate the fair values of our Solar Asset and Loan-backed Notes 
based on rates currently offered for instruments with similar maturities and 
terms (Level III). The following table presents the estimated fair values and 
the carrying values (in millions):
