During the year ended December 31, 2021, we recorded $101 million of impairment 
losses on bitcoin. We also realized gains of $128 million in connection with 
selling a portion of our holdings in March 2021.

During the year ended December 31, 2019, we carried out certain restructuring 
actions in order to reduce costs and improve efficiency. As a result, we 
recognized $50 million of costs primarily related to employee termination 
expenses and losses from closing certain stores impacting both segments. We 
recognized $47 million in impairment related to the in-process research and 
development intangible asset as we abandoned further development efforts and $15
million for the related equipment within the energy generation and storage 
segment. We also incurred a loss of $37 million for closing operations in 
certain facilities. On the statement of cash flows, the amounts were presented 
in the captions in which such amounts would have been recorded absent the 
impairment charges. The employee termination expenses were substantially paid by
December 31, 2019, while the remaining amounts were non-cash.
