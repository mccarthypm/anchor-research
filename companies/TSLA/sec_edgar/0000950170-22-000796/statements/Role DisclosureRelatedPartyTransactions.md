In May 2019, our CEO purchased from us514,400 shares of our common stock in a 
public offering at the public offering price for an aggregate $25 million.

In February 2020, our CEO and a member of our Board of Directors purchased from 
us65,185 and6,250 shares, respectively, of our common stock in a public offering
at the public offering price for an aggregate $10 million and $1 million, 
respectively.

In June 2020, our CEO entered into an indemnification agreement with us for an 
interim term of90 days. During the interim term, we resumed our annual 
evaluation of all available options for providing directors’ and officers’ 
indemnity coverage, which we had suspended during the height of shelter-in-place
requirements related to the COVID-19 pandemic. As part of such process, we 
obtained a binding market quote for a directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance policy with an aggregate coverage limit of $100 million.

Pursuant to the indemnification agreement, our CEO provided, from his personal 
funds, directors’ and officers’ indemnity coverage to us during the interim term
in the event such coverage is not indemnifiable by us, up to a total of $100 
million. In return, we paid our CEO a total of $3 million, which represents the 
market-based premium for the market quote described above as prorated for 90 
days and further discounted by50%. Following the lapse of the 90-day period, we 
did not extend the term of the indemnification agreement with our CEO and 
instead bound a customary directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy 
with third-party carriers.
