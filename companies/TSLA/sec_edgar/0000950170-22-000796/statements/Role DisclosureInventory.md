Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer 
orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles, energy storage products 
and Solar Roof products available for sale.

For solar energy systems, we commence transferring component parts from 
inventory to construction in progress, a component of solar energy systems, once
a lease or PPA contract with a customer has been executed and installation has 
been initiated. Additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, 
including labor and overhead, are recorded within solar energy systems under 
construction.

We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we 
believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying 
value. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we recorded 
write-downs of$106 million,$145 million and $138 million, respectively, in Cost 
of revenues in the consolidated statements of operations.
