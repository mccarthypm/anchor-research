Construction in progress is primarily comprised of construction of Gigafactory 
Berlin and Gigafactory Texas, expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and equipment 
and tooling related to the manufacturing of our products. We are currently 
constructing Gigafactory Berlin under conditional permits in anticipation of 
being granted final permits. Completed assets are transferred to their 
respective asset classes and depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its 
intended use. Interest on outstanding debt is capitalized during periods of 
significant capital asset construction and amortized over the useful lives of 
the related assets. During the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we 
capitalized interest of$53 million,$48 million and $31 million, respectively.

Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019 
was$1.91 billion,$1.57 billion and$1.37 billion, respectively. Gross property, 
plant and equipment under finance leases as of December 31, 2021 and 2020 
was$2.75 billion and$2.28 billion, respectively, with accumulated depreciation 
of$1.21 billion and$816 million, respectively.

Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the 
production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery 
cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output
from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the 
arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, Leases, we account for their 
production equipment as leased assets when production commences. We account for 
each lease and any non-lease components associated with that lease as a single 
lease component for all asset classes, except production equipment classes 
embedded in supply agreements. This results in us recording the cost of their 
production equipment within Property, plant and equipment, net, on the 
consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding liability recorded to debt and 
finance leases. Depreciation on Panasonic production equipment is computed using
the units-of-production method whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the 
total estimated productive life of the respective assets. As of December 31, 
2021 and 2020, we had cumulatively capitalized gross costs of$1.98 billion 
and$1.77 billion, respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation 
to the production equipment under our Panasonic arrangement.

During the y ears ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we received cash 
incentives of $6 million, $123 million and $46 million, respectively, from the 
Shanghai government in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment
investments at Gigafactory Shanghai. These incentives were taken as a reduction 
to Property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets and 
cash receipts were reflected as investing cash inflows on the consolidated 
statements of cash flows.
