Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of 
likelihood that customers would exercise their resale value guarantees, 
resulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with 
resale value guarantees. Actual return rates being lower than expected and 
increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of 
our reserve of $

365

million, which represented an increase in automotive sales revenue. For the 
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, vehicle pricing reductions resulted in 
an increase of our reserve of $

72

million and $

555

million, respectively, which represented decreases in automotive sales revenue.
