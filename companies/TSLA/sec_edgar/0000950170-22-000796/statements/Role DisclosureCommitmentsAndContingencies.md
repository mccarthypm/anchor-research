Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State 
University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”) with respect to Gigafactory New 
York. Under the lease and a related research and development agreement, we are 
continuing to further develop the facility.

Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment 
targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New 
York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined 
capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State 
of New York during the10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual 
basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such 
date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation 
requirements, then we would be obligated to pay a $41 million “program payment” 
to the SUNY Foundation for each year that we fail to meet these requirements. 
Furthermore, if the arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, 
then additional amounts may become payable by us.

As we temporarily suspended most of our manufacturing operations at Gigafactory 
New York pursuant to a New York State executive order issued in March 2020 as a 
result of the COVID-19 pandemic, we were granted a deferral of our obligation to
be compliant with our applicable targets through December 31, 2021 in an 
amendment memorialized in August 2021. The amendment also extended our overall 
agreement to spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational 
expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State of New York through 
December 31, 2029. As of December 31, 2021, we are currently in excess of such 
targets relating to investments and personnel in the State of New York and 
Buffalo and do not currently expect any issues meeting our applicable 
obligations following this expected deferral or in the years beyond. However, if
our expectations as to the costs and timelines of our investment and operations 
at Buffalo or our production ramp of the Solar Roof prove incorrect, we may 
incur additional expenses or be required to make substantial payments to the 
SUNY Foundation.

Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China

We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of50 years with the 
local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing 
Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to 
spend RMB14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023 and to 
generate RMB2.23 billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If 
we are unwilling or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project 
approvals, in accordance with the Chinese government’s standard terms for such 
arrangements, we would be required to revert the site to the local government 
and receive compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings 
and fixtures. We expect to meet the capital expenditure and tax revenue 
requirements based on our current level of spend and sales.

Legal Proceedings

Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the 
Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our 
acquisition of SolarCity Corporation (“SolarCity”). Following consolidation, the
lawsuit names as defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then 
constituted and alleges, among other things, that board members breached their 
fiduciary duties in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both 
derivative claims and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, 
among other relief, unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees and costs. On 
January 27, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. 
Rather than respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended 
complaint. On March 17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended 
complaint. On December 13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. On
March 28, 2018, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed
a request for interlocutory appeal, and the Delaware Supreme Court denied that 
request without ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this 
early stage of the case. Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018, and 
mediations were held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed 
respective motions for summary judgment on August 25, 2019, and further 
mediations were held on October 3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions
for summary judgment on November 4, 2019. On January 22, 2020, all of the 
director defendants except Elon Musk reached a settlement to resolve the lawsuit
against them for an amount to be paid entirely under the applicable insurance 
policy. The settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by
any party, was approved by the Court on August 17, 2020. Tesla received payment 
of approximately $43 million on September 16, 2020, which has been recognized in
our consolidated statement of operations as a reduction to Selling, general and 
administrative operating expenses for costs previously incurred related to the 
acquisition of SolarCity. On February 4, 2020, the Court issued a ruling that 
denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion for summary judgment and granted in 
part and denied in part defendants’ previously-filed motion for summary 
judgment. The case was set for trial in March 2020 until it was postponed by the
Court due to safety precautions concerning COVID-19. The trial was held from 
July 12 to July 23, 2021 and on August 16, 2021. On October 22, 2021, the Court 
approved the parties’ joint stipulation that (a) the class is decertified and 
the action shall continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of 
Chancery Rule 23.1; and (b) the direct claims against Elon Musk are dismissed 
with prejudice. Following post-trial briefing, post-trial argument was held on 
January 18, 2022. The matter is now submitted, and a decision is expected by 
middle of 2022.

These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U. S. District Court 
for the District of Delaware on or about April 21, 2017. They include claims for
violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by 
Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed 
pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.

Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award

On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and 
derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the 
members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate 
waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary 
duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 
2018. The complaint seeks, among other things, monetary damages and rescission 
or reformation of the stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its 
opposition brief on November 1, 2018; and defendants filed a reply brief on 
December 13, 2018. The hearing on the motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019.
On September 20, 2019, the Court granted the motion to dismiss as to the 
corporate waste claim but denied the motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty 
and unjust enrichment claims. Defendants' answer was filed on December 3, 2019.

On January 25, 2021, the Court conditionally certified certain claims and a 
class of Tesla stockholders as a class action. On September 30, 2021, plaintiff 
filed a motion for leave to file a verified amended derivative complaint. On 
October 1, 2021, defendants Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson moved for summary 
judgment as to the claims against them. Following the motion, plaintiff agreed 
to voluntarily dismiss the claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson. 
Plaintiff also moved for summary judgment on October 1, 2021. On October 27, 
2021, the Court approved the parties’ joint stipulation that, among other 
things, (a) all claims against Kimbal Musk and Steve Jurvetson in the Complaint 
are dismissed with prejudice; (b) the class is decertified and the action shall 
continue exclusively as a derivative action under Court of Chancery Rule 23.1; 
and (c) the direct claims against the remaining defendants are dismissed with 
prejudice. On November 18, 2021, the remaining defendants (a) moved for partial 
summary judgment, (b) opposed plaintiff’s summary judgment motion, and (c) 
opposed the plaintiff’s motion to amend his complaint. Oral argument on summary 
judgment and the motion to amend were set for January 6, 2022, however, it was 
canceled by the Court. The case was recently assigned to a different judge. 
Trial is currently set for April 18-22, 2022.

Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation

On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of 
Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to 
Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts
claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory 
and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed 
their answer on September 17, 2020. Trial is set for September 11, 2023.

Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction

Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class 
actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s 
August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of
the suits are now pending in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District 
of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each 
purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to 
Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief 
on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs 
filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants 
the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The now-consolidated purported 
stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel
was briefed and argued before the Ninth Circuit. The Ninth Circuit ruled 
regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to dismiss the complaint on 
November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion was held on March 6, 2020. On April
15, 2020, the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. The parties stipulated
to certification of a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November
25, 2020. On January 11, 2022, plaintiff filed a motion for partial summary 
judgment which is currently pending before the Court. Trial is set for May 2022.

Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed
in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. 
Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant 
times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going
private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter
posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Five of those actions were consolidated, 
and all seven actions have been stayed pending resolution of the 
above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. In addition to
these cases, two derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February
11, 2019 in the U. S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly 
on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of 
directors as then constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and 
stayed pending resolution of the above-referenced consolidated purported 
stockholder class action.

Unless otherwise stated, the individual defendants named in the stockholder 
proceedings described above and the Company with respect to the stockholder 
class action proceedings described above believe that the claims in such 
proceedings have no merit and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are 
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with 
these claims.

On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank (“JP Morgan”) filed a lawsuit against 
Tesla in the Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant 
agreement that was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014.
In 2018, JP Morgan informed Tesla that it had adjusted the strike price based 
upon Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla
private. Tesla disputed JP Morgan’s adjustment as a violation of the parties’ 
agreement. In 2021 Tesla delivered shares to JP Morgan per the agreement, which 
they duly accepted. JP Morgan now alleges that it is owed approximately $162 
million as the value of additional shares that it claims should have been 
delivered as a result of the adjustment to the strike price in 2018. On January 
24, 2022, Tesla filed multiple counterclaims as part of its answer to the 
underlying lawsuit, asserting among other points that JP Morgan should have 
terminated the stock warrant agreement in 2018 rather than make an adjustment to
the strike price that it should have known would lead to a commercially 
unreasonable result. Tesla believes that the adjustments made by JP Morgan were 
neither proper nor commercially reasonable, as required under the stock warrant 
agreements.

Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Race Discrimination

On October 4, 2021, in a case captionedDiaz v. Tesla, a jury in the Northern 
District of California returned a verdict of $136.9 million against Tesla on 
claims by a former contingent worker that he was subjected to race 
discrimination while assigned to work at Tesla's Fremont Factory from 2015-2016.
The Company does not believe that the facts and law justify the verdict. On 
November 16, 2021, Tesla filed a post-trial motion for relief that included a 
request for a new trial or reduction of the jury's damages. The court held a 
hearing on Tesla's motion on January 19, 2022, and a decision is expected soon. 
Tesla will pursue next steps, including an appeal, if necessary.

On January 3, 2022, the California Department of Fair Employment and Housing 
(“DFEH”) issued Tesla a Notice of Cause Finding and Mandatory Dispute Resolution
following an investigation into undisclosed allegations of race discrimination 
and harassment at unspecified Tesla locations. The DFEH gave notice that, based 
upon the evidence collected, it believes that it has grounds to file a civil 
complaint against Tesla.

Certain Investigations and Other Matters

We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental 
authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”)
and various state, federal, and international agencies. We routinely cooperate 
with such regulatory and governmental requests, including subpoenas, formal and 
informal requests and other investigations and inquiries.

For example, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with Elon 
Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. The 
take-private investigation was resolved and closed with a settlement entered 
into with the SEC in September 2018 and as further clarified in April 2019 in an
amendment. More recently, on November 16, 2021, the SEC issued a subpoena to us 
seeking information on our governance processes around compliance with the SEC 
settlement, as amended.

On December 4, 2019, the SEC issued a subpoena seeking information concerning 
certain financial data and contracts including Tesla’s regular financing 
arrangements. On December 16, 2021, the SEC informed us that it closed this 
investigation. Separately, the DOJ had also asked us to voluntarily provide it 
with information about the above matter related to taking Tesla private and 
Model 3 production rates. We have not received any further requests from DOJ on 
these matters since we last provided information in May 2019. There have not 
been any additional developments in these matters that we deem to be material, 
and to our knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has 
concluded that any wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been 
cooperating and will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We 
cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the 
government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there exists the possibility 
of a material adverse impact on our business, results of operation, prospects, 
cash flows and financial position.

We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise 
from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or 
development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse 
impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial 
position and brand.

Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns

We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any 
losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from 
reductions in investment tax credits claimed under U. S. federal laws for the 
installation of solar power facilities and energy storage systems that are 
charged from a co-sited solar power facility. We believe that any payments to 
the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us for this 
obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the filing 
date.

We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are 
associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can 
be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or 
the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one 
state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the 
tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives 
received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the 
contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to 
indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in 
the amount of state or local incentives actually received.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2021, we had $286 million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
