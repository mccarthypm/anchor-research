| **  Principles of Consolidation** | Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and 
reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we 
have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any
variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We 
have formed VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of 
business in order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain 
attributes associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct 
vehicle leasing programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial 
interest ownership is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; 
however, a controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as 
VIEs, through arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC
810 requires a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has 
the power to direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the
VIE’s economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that 
could potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits 
from the VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not 
consolidate a VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not
considered the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary 
beneficiary of all the VIEs (seeNote 16, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements).
We evaluate our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure 
that we continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions 
and balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

|   Use of Estimates | Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with U. S. GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities, revenues, costs and expenses and related disclosures in the
accompanying notes.

Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been uncertainty and disruption in the 
global economy and financial markets which could impact our estimates and 
assumptions. We have assessed the impact and are not aware of any specific 
events or circumstances that required an update to our estimates and assumptions
or materially affected the carrying value of our assets or liabilities as of the
date of issuance of this Annual Report on Form 10-K. These estimates may change 
as new events occur and additional information is obtained. Actual results could
differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or 
conditions.

Pricing adjustments on our vehicle offerings can impact the estimate of 
likelihood that customers would exercise their resale value guarantees, 
resulting in an adjustment of our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with 
resale value guarantees. Actual return rates being lower than expected and 
increases in resale values of our vehicles in 2021 resulted in a net release of 
our reserve of $

365

million, which represented an increase in automotive sales revenue. For the 
years ended December 31, 2020 and 2019, vehicle pricing reductions resulted in 
an increase of our reserve of $

72

million and $

555

million, respectively, which represented decreases in automotive sales revenue.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales Revenue

Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles
and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the 
definition of a performance obligation under ASC 606, including access to our 
Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Full Self Driving ("FSD") features 
and over-the-air software updates. We recognize revenue on automotive sales upon
delivery to the customer, which is when the control of a vehicle transfers. 
Payments are typically received at the point control transfers or in accordance 
with payment terms customary to the business. Other features and services such 
as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity and over-the-air 
software updates are provisioned upon control transfer of a vehicle and 
recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we have a stand-ready 
obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We recognize revenue 
related to these other features and services over the performance period, which 
is generally the estimated useful life of the vehicle. Revenue related to FSD 
features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For our 
obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling price by
considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party pricing 
of similar options and other information that may be available.

At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a
sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration 
related to future product returns. Such return rate estimates are based on 
historical experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, 
any fees that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange 
the financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.

Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales 
personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other 
obligations such as access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, 
FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs related to
automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs to obtain a 
contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers related to 
shipping and handling are classified as automotive sales revenue, and we have 
elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over 
vehicles, parts or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense in
cost of automotive sales revenue. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from 
a customer from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option

We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain 
international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles 
through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale 
value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing 
partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales 
price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling 
their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is 
generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, 
for a pre-determined resale value.

We recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to customers in 
accordance with ASC 606 as a sale with a right of return when we do not believe 
the customer has a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value 
guarantee provided to them at contract inception. The process to determine 
whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a 
vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the 
guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to 
exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive 
sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without 
resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return 
reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees
are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected 
future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market 
values of vehicles sold with resale value guarantees to determine whether there 
have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate 
more data related to the resale values of our vehicles or as market conditions 
change, there may be material changes to their estimated values.

Due to actual return rates being lower than expected and increases in resale 
values of our vehicles during 2021, we estimated that there is a lower future 
likelihood that customers will exercise their resale value guarantees. We 
adjusted our sales return reserve on vehicles sold with resale value guarantees 
resulting in an increase of automotive sales revenues of $365 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2021 and a corresponding increase in cost of automotive 
sales of $286 million. The net benefit in gross profit was $79 million for the 
year ended December 31, 2021. The total sales return reserve on vehicles sold 
with resale value guarantees was$223 million and$703 million as of December 31, 
2021 and December 31, 2020, respectively, of which$91 million and$202 million 
was short term, respectively.

Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, 
internet connectivity, FSD features and over-the-air software updates on 
automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the 
following (in millions):

Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the 
performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of 
the balance sheet date. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as 
of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was$312 million and$283 million for the years 
ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Of the total deferred revenue on
automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees as of December 31, 
2021, we expect to recognize$962 million of revenue in the next 12 months. The 
remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as discussed 
above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee.

Automotive Regulatory Credits

We earn tradable credits in the operation of our automotive business under 
various regulations related to zero-emission vehicles, greenhouse gas, fuel 
economy and clean fuel. We sell these credits to other regulated entities who 
can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory 
requirements.

Payments for automotive regulatory credits are typically received at the point 
control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business. We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory 
credits, which have negligible incremental costs associated with them, at the 
time control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party. 
Revenue from the sale of automotive regulatory credits totaled $1.46 billion, 
$1.58 billion and $594 million for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 
2019, respectively. Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory 
credits was immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Revenue 
recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 
was immaterial and$140 million for the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Direct Vehicle Operating Leasing Program

We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle operating leasing programs 
in the U. S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. Qualifying customers 
are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up to48 months. At the 
end of the lease term, customers are required to return the vehicles to us or, 
for Model S and Model X in certain regions, may opt to purchase the vehicles for
a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as 
operating leases. We record leasing revenues to automotive leasing revenue on a 
straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we record the depreciation of
these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue. For the years ended 
December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recognized $1.25 billion, $752 million and 
$532 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, respectively. As of December 31,
2021 and 2020, we had deferred $392 million and $293 million, respectively, of 
lease-related upfront payments, which will be recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the contractual terms of the individual leases.

Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction 
price of automotive contracts.

Direct Sales-Type Leasing Program

We have outstanding direct leases and vehicles financed by us under loan 
arrangements accounted for as sales-type leases under ASC 842 in certain 
countries in Asia and Europe, which we introduced during the third quarter of 
2020. Depending on the specific program, customers may or may not have a right 
to return the vehicle to us during or at the end of the lease term. If the 
customer does not have a right to return, the customer will take title to the 
vehicle at the end of the lease term after making all contractual payments. 
Under the programs for which there is a right to return, the purchase option is 
reasonably certain to be exercised by the lessee and we therefore expect the 
customer to take title to the vehicle at the end of the lease term after making 
all contractual payments. Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle 
directly under these programs for up to48 months. Our loan arrangements under 
these programs can have terms for up to72 months. We recognize all revenue and 
costs associated with the sales-type lease as automotive leasing revenue and 
automotive leasing cost of revenue, respectively, upon delivery of the vehicle 
to the customer. Interest income based on the implicit rate in the lease is 
recorded to automotive leasing revenue over time as customers are invoiced on a 
monthly basis. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we recognized$369
million and $120 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing revenue and$234 
million and $87 million, respectively, of sales-type leasing cost of revenue.

Services and Other Revenue

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle 
services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired 
subsidiaries to third party customers and vehicle insurance revenue.

Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as 
services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the 
performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a 
stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service
plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone 
selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these 
items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for 
used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point 
when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable 
upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within 
customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheets. Deferred revenue related 
to services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2021 and 2020.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage Sales

Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy
systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, large 
commercial and utility grade customers. Energy generation and storage sales 
revenue also includes revenue from agreements for solar energy systems and power
purchase agreements (“PPAs”) that commence after January 1, 2019, which is 
recognized as earned, based on the amount of capacity provided for solar energy 
systems or electricity delivered for PPAs at the contractual billing rates, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. Under the 
practical expedient available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize revenue based
on the value of the service which is consistent with the billing amount. Sales 
of solar energy systems to residential and small scale commercial customers 
consist of the engineering, design and installation of the system. 
Post-installation, residential and small scale commercial customers receive a 
proprietary monitoring system that captures and displays historical energy 
generation data. Residential and small scale commercial customers pay the full 
purchase price of the solar energy system upfront. Revenue for the design and 
installation obligation is recognized when control transfers, which is when we 
install a solar energy system and the system passes inspection by the utility or
the authority having jurisdiction. Sales of energy storage systems to 
residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the installation of 
the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control transfers, 
which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing 
installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems 
is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the 
business.

For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage 
system sales which consist of the engineering, design and installation of the 
system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with 
contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized
over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a 
percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and
as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. 
Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy 
storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are 
negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to
be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain 
large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage 
systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is 
recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered 
to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project
has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. 
Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the 
respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the 
service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are
usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.

In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single 
contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the 
contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone 
selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or by using 
market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential 
installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work
in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. Any fees that 
are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized as an 
offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to commissions 
paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy systems and 
energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar energy system and
energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs 
to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.

As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may 
provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the 
underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or energy 
performance requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may
receive a bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. 
Conversely, if a solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the 
performance guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated 
damages. Other forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial 
and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts 
include variable customer payments that will be made based on our energy market 
participation activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments 
represent a form of variable consideration and are estimated at contract 
inception at their most likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting 
period as additional performance data becomes available. Such estimates are 
included in the transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a 
significant reversal of revenue will not occur.

We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from
customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service 
and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably 
over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, 
deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to$399 million 
and$187 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue 
balance as of December 31, 2020 and 2019 was$93 million and$34 million for the 
years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. We have elected the 
practical expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price 
allocated to remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage
sales with an original expected contract length of one year or less and the 
amount that we have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly 
with the value of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2021, total 
transaction price allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or 
partially unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more 
than one year was$152 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize$9 million 
in the next 12 months and the remaining over a period up to26 years.

Energy Generation and Storage Leasing

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue 
from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned 
from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference 
between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred
revenue or deferred asset on the consolidated balance sheet.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs
prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be 
accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized 
based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the 
contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and 
maintenance service fees, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the 
respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred 
revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $198 million and $206 
million, respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and
incentives received from utility companies and various local and state 
government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of 
December 31, 2021 and 2020, deferred revenue from rebates and incentives 
amounted to $27 million and $29 million, respectively.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar 
energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, 
as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these 
costs over the term of the related agreements.

costs were immaterial for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019.

| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

The Tax Cuts and Jobs Act ("TCJA") subjects a U. S. shareholder to tax on global
intangible low-taxed income (“GILTI”) earned by certain foreign subsidiaries. 
Under GAAP, we can make an accounting policy election to either treat taxes due 
on the GILTI inclusion as a current period expense or factor such amounts into 
our measurement of deferred taxes. We elected the deferred method, under which 
we recorded the corresponding deferred tax assets and liabilities on our 
consolidated balance sheets, currently subject to valuation allowance.

| **  Comprehensive Income (Loss)** | Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other 
comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of 
foreign currency translation adjustments and unrealized net gains and losses on 
marketable securities that have been excluded from the determination of net 
income (loss).
 |  |  |
|   Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-Based Compensation

We use the fair value method of accounting for our stock options and restricted 
stock units (“RSUs”) granted to employees and for our employee stock purchase 
plan (the “ESPP”) to measure the cost of employee services received in exchange 
for the stock-based awards. The fair value of stock option awards with only 
service and/or performance conditions is estimated on the grant or offering date
using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The Black-Scholes option-pricing 
model requires inputs such as the risk-free interest rate, expected term and 
expected volatility. These inputs are subjective and generally require 
significant judgment. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based
on the closing fair market value of our common stock. The resulting cost is 
recognized over the period during which an employee is required to provide 
service in exchange for the awards, usually the vesting period, which is 
generally four years for stock options and RSUs and six months for the ESPP. 
Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line basis, net of 
actual forfeitures in the period.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on
the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based 
compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer 
of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such 
tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market 
capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in
time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being 
achieved. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the 
grant date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date 
to that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is 
achieved earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the
related operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be
recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, 
which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair 
value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo 
simulations.

As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we
incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate 
significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially 
impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation 
expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation 
expense is recorded in Cost of revenues, Research and development expense and 
Selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of 
operations.

| **  Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests** | Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that we have entered into to finance the costs of solar energy systems 
and vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual 
provisions of the funds represent substantive profit-sharing arrangements. We 
have further determined that the methodology for calculating the noncontrolling 
interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that reflects the 
substantive profit-sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach using the 
hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore, determine
the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet date using the 
HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet as 
noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling interests
in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as noncontrolling 
interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the consolidated balance 
sheet represent the amounts the third parties would hypothetically receive at 
each balance sheet date under the liquidation provisions of the funds, assuming 
the net assets of the funds were liquidated at their recorded amounts determined
in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws effective at the balance sheet date 
and distributed to the third parties. The third parties’ interests in the 
results of operations of the funds are determined as the difference in the 
noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances in the 
consolidated balance sheets between the start and end of each reporting period, 
after taking into account any capital transactions between the funds and the 
third parties. However, the redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is at 
least equal to the redemption amount. The redeemable noncontrolling interest 
balance is presented as temporary equity in the mezzanine section of the 
consolidated balance sheet since these third parties have the right to redeem 
their interests in the funds for cash or other assets. For certain funds, there 
may be significant fluctuations in net income (loss) attributable to 
noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries
due to changes in the liquidation provisions as time-based milestones are

| **  Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders** | Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common 
stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the 
period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the weighted-average 
shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based awards, warrants and 
convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or the if-converted 
method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted net income (loss) 
per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders when their effect 
is dilutive.

On January 1, 2021, we adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective 
method. Following this adoption, we utilize the if-converted method for diluted 
net income per share calculation of our convertible debt instruments (see Recent
Accounting Pronouncements section below for further details). During the year 
ended December 31, 2021, we increased net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders by $9 million to arrive at the numerator used to calculate diluted 
net income per share, which represents the interest expense recognized on the 
convertible debt instruments that were subject to this change in methodology.

Prior to the adoption, we applied the treasury stock method when calculating the
potential dilutive effect, if any, of the following convertible senior notes 
which we intended to settle or have settled in cash the principal outstanding. 
Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our convertible senior notes, 
we entered into convertible note hedges and warrants (seeNote 11, Debt). 
However, our convertible note hedges are not included when calculating 
potentially dilutive shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. The 
strike price on the warrants were below our average share price during the 
period and were in the money and included in the tables below. Warrants have 
been included in the weighted-average shares used in computing basic net income 
(loss) per share of common stock in the period(s) they are settled.

The following table presents the reconciliation of net income (loss) 
attributable to common stockholders to net income (loss) used in computing basic
and diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock (in millions):

|   Business Combinations | Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.

| **  Cash and Cash Equivalents** | Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents 
are primarily comprised of money market funds.
 |  |  |
|   Restricted Cash | Restricted Cash

We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our 
restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash held to service certain payments 
under various secured debt facilities. In addition, restricted cash includes 
cash held as collateral for certain permits as well as sales to lease partners 
with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate leases, insurance 
policies, certain operating leases and cash received from certain fund investors
that have not been released for use by us. We record restricted cash as other 
assets in the consolidated balance sheets and determine current or non-current 
classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.

Our total cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash, as presented in the 
consolidated statements of cash flows, was as follows (in millions):

|   Marketable Securities | Marketable Securities

Marketable securities may be comprised of a combination of U. S. government 
securities and corporate debt securities and are all designated as 
available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains 
and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income which is included 
within stockholders’ equity. Available-for-sale marketable securities with 
maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase are included in 
short-term marketable securities on our consolidated balance sheet. Interest, 
dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our 
marketable securities are included in other income (expense), net.

The cost of available-for-sale marketable securities sold is based on the 
specific identification method. Realized gains and losses on the sale of 
available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other income (expense),
net.

We regularly review all of our marketable securities for declines in fair value.
The review includes but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of 
the decline, (ii) any currently recorded expected credit losses and (iii) the 
creditworthiness of the respective security issuers. The amortized cost basis of
our marketable securities approximates its fair value.

| **  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts** | Accoun ts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of 
regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers, government rebates already
passed through to customers and maintenance services on vehicles owned by 
leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts receivable for the 
amount we expect to be uncollectible. We write-off accounts receivable against 
the allowance when they are deemed uncollectible.

Depending on the day of the week on which the end of a fiscal quarter falls, our
accounts receivable balance may fluctuate as we are waiting for certain customer
payments to clear through our banking institutions and receipts of payments from
our financing partners, which can take up to approximately two weeks based on 
the contractual payment terms with such partners. Our accounts receivable 
balances associated with our sales of regulatory credits, which are typically 
transferred to other manufacturers during the last few days of the quarter, is 
dependent on contractual payment terms. Additionally, government rebates can 
take up to a year or more to be collected depending on the customary processing 
timelines of the specific jurisdictions issuing them. These various factors may 
have a significant impact on our accounts receivable balance from period to 
period. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had $627 million and $46 million, 
respectively, of long-term government rebates receivable in Other non-current 
assets on our consolidated balance sheets.

|   MyPower Customer Notes Receivable | MyPower Customer Notes Receivable

We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program, which 
provided residential customers with the option to finance the purchase of a 
solar energy system through a30-year loan. The outstanding balances, net of any 
allowance for expected credit losses, are presented on the consolidated balance 
sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the 
current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. In 
determining expected credit losses, we consider our historical level of credit 
losses, current economic trends, and reasonable and supportable forecasts that 
affect the collectability of the future cash flows. As of December 31, 2021 and 
2020, the total outstanding balance of MyPower customer notes receivable, net of
allowance for expected credit losses, was$299 million and$334 million, 
respectively, of which$11 million and$9 million were due in the next 12 months 
as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively. As of December 31, 2021 and 
2020, the allowance for expected credit losses was$41 million and$45 million, 
respectively.

|   Concentration of Risk | Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable securities, restricted cash, 
accounts receivable, convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash 
balances are primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high 
credit quality financial institutions in the U. S. These deposits are typically 
in excess of insured limits. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, no entity 
represented10% or more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of 
concentration for our convertible note hedges and interest rate swaps is 
mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated multinational banks.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, including single source suppliers, and the 
inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components of our products in 
a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes acceptable to us, or our 
inability to efficiently manage these components from these suppliers, could 
have a material adverse effect on our business, prospects, financial condition 
and operating results.
 |  |  |
| **  Inventory Valuation** | Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is 
computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which 
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for 
solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory 
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about 
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of 
our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the
net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us 
to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost
to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material write-downs may be required. A small change 
in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported financial 
results.
 |  |  |
| **  Operating Lease Vehicles** | Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program are 
classified as operating lease vehicles at cost less accumulated depreciation. We
generally depreciate their cost, less residual value, using the 
straight-line-method to cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual 
period. The gross cost of operating lease vehicles as of December 31, 2021 and 
2020 was$5.28 billion and$3.54 billion, respectively. Operating lease vehicles 
on the consolidated balance sheets are presented net of accumulated depreciation
of$773 million and$446 million as of December 31, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

| **  Digital Assets, Net** | During the year ended December 31, 2021, we purchased an aggregate of$1.50 
billion in bitcoin (a "digital asset") and briefly accepted bitcoin as a payment
for sales of certain of our products in specified regions, subject to applicable
laws. We account for such non-cash consideration at the time we enter into 
transactions with our customers in accordance with the non-cash consideration 
guidance included in the Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 606, Revenue 
from Contracts with Customers, based on the then current quoted market prices of
the digital assets.

We currently account for all digital assets held as a result of these 
transactions as indefinite-lived intangible assets in accordance with ASC 350, 
Intangibles - Goodwill and Other. We have ownership of and control over our 
digital assets and we may use third-party custodial services to secure it. The 
digital assets are initially recorded at cost and are subsequently remeasured on
the consolidated balance sheet at cost, net of any impairment losses incurred 
since acquisition.

We determine the fair value of our digital assets on a nonrecurring basis in 
accordance with ASC 820, Fair Value Measurement, based on quoted prices on the 
active exchange(s) that we have determined is the principal market for such 
assets (Level 1 inputs). We perform an analysis each quarter to identify whether
events or changes in circumstances, principally decreases in the quoted prices 
on active exchanges, indicate that it is more likely than not that our digital 
assets are impaired. In determining if an impairment has occurred, we consider 
the lowest market price of one unit of digital asset quoted on the active 
exchange since acquiring the digital asset. If the then current carrying value 
of a digital asset exceeds the fair value so determined, an impairment loss has 
occurred with respect to those digital assets in the amount equal to the 
difference between their carrying values and the price determined.

Impairment losses are recognized within Restructuring and other in the 
consolidated statements of operations in the period in which the impairment is 
identified. The impaired digital assets are written down to their fair value at 
the time of impairment and this new cost basis will not be adjusted upward for 
any subsequent increase in fair value. Gains are not recorded until realized 
upon sale(s), at which point they are presented net of any impairment losses for
the same digital assets held within Restructuring and other. In determining the 
gain to be recognized upon sale, we calculate the difference between the sales 
price and carrying value of the digital assets sold immediately prior to sale.

SeeNote 3, Digital Assets, Net, for further information regarding digital 
assets.

| **  Solar Renewable Energy Credits** | Solar Energy Systems, Net

We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Solar energy systems are stated at 
cost less accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems in service               30 to 35 years               
  Initial direct costs related to customer      Lease term (up to 25 years)  

Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy
systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. 
Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under 
installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when 
they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs 
related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are 
capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.

Solar Renewable Energy Credits

We account for Solar Renewable Energy Certificates (“SRECs”) when they are 
purchased by us or sold to third parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy 
systems owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any 
specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs 
incurred to generate the SRECs. We recognize revenue within the energy 
generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is 
transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to 
energy generation and storage cost of revenue.

| **  Property, Plant and Equipment, net** | Property, Plant and Equipment, Net

Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are 
recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally 
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
respective assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and      3 to 15 years   
  Tooling                                 4 to 7 years    
  Building and building improvements      15 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software         3 to 10 years   

Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance 
sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement
of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified 
useful life.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in 
progress is included within Property, plant and equipment, net and is amortized 
over the life of the related assets.

| **  Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets** | Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review our property, plant and equipment, solar energy systems, long-term 
prepayments and intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may
not be recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount 
to the future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If
the asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted down to its 
fair value. For the years ended December 31, 2021 and 2020, we have recognized 
no material impairments of our long-lived assets. For the year ended December 
31, 2019, we have recognized certain impairments of our long-lived assets (refer
toNote 19, Restructuring and Other, for further details).

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from three to thirty years.

Goodwill

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. 
For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020, and 2019, we did no t recognized 
any impairment of goodwill.

|   Capitalization of Software Costs | Capitalization of Software Costs

We capitalize costs incurred in the development of internal use software, during
the application development stage to Property, plant and equipment, net on the 
consolidated balance sheets. Costs related to preliminary project activities and
post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. Such costs are 
amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life of three 
years.

S oftware development costs incurred in development of software to be sold, 
leased, or otherwise marketed, incurred subsequent to the establishment of 
technological feasibility and prior to the general availability of the software 
are capitalized when they are expected to become significant. Such costs are 
amortized over the estimated useful life of the applicable software once it is 
made generally available to our customers.

We evaluate the useful lives of these assets on an annual basis, and we test for
impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances occur that could impact 
the recoverability of these assets. For the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020,
and 2019, we have recognized no material impairments of capitalized software 
costs.

| **  Foreign Currency** | Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U. S. 
dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the 
different rates we apply to current period income or loss and the balance sheet.
For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly average functional exchange rate to 
its monthly income or loss and the month-end functional currency rate to 
translate the balance sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in Other income
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years 
ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, we recorded a net foreign currency 
transaction gain of $97 million, loss of $114 million and gain of $48 million, 
respectively.

|   Warranties | Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles anda warranty 
on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage systems 
we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a warranty 
reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate of the 
projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls if 
identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and an 
estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates 
are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and 
changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material 
changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not 
include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to 
operating lease accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or
PPAs, as the costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The
portion of the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 
months is included within Accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining 
balance is included within Other long-term liabilities on the consolidated 
balance sheets. Warranty expense is recorded as a component of Cost of revenues 
in the consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our 
automotive business, accrued warranty balance is primarily related to our 
automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following (in 
millions):

| **  Customer Deposits** | Customer Deposits

Customer deposits primarily consist of cash payments from customers at the time 
they place an order or reservation for a vehicle or an energy product and any 
additional payments up to the point of delivery or the completion of 
installation, including the fair values of any customer trade-in vehicles that 
are applicable toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposits also include 
prepayments on contracts that can be cancelled without significant penalties, 
such as vehicle maintenance plans. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary 
depending on the vehicle model, the energy product and the country of delivery. 
With the exception of a nominal order fee, customer deposits are fully 
refundable on vehicles prior to delivery and fully refundable in the case of an 
energy generation or storage product prior to the entry into a purchase 
agreement or in certain cases for a limited time thereafter (in accordance with 
applicable laws). Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until 
refunded, forfeited or applied towards the customer’s purchase balance.

| **  Nevada Tax Incentive and Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives** | Nevada Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Nevada, we entered into 
agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in Nevada that provide 
abatements for specified taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and 
transferable tax credits of up to $195 million in consideration of capital 
investment and hiring targets that were met at Gigafactory Nevada. These 
incentives are available until June 2024 or June 2034, depending on the 
incentive. As of December 31, 2021 and 2020, we had earned the maximum of $195 
million of transferable tax credits under these agreements.

Gigafactory Texas Tax Incentives

In connection with the construction of Gigafactory Texas, we entered into 
a20-year agreement with Travis County in Texas pursuant to which we would 
receive grant funding equal to70-80% of property taxes paid by us to Travis 
County and a separate10-year agreement with the Del Valle Independent School 
District in Texas pursuant to which a portion of the taxable value of our 
property would be capped at a specified amount, in each case subject to our 
meeting certain minimum economic development metrics through our construction 
and operations at Gigafactory Texas. As of December 31, 2021, we had no t yet 
received any grant funding related to property taxes paid to Travis County.

| **  Defined Contribution Plan** | Defined Contribution Plan

We have a 401(k) savings plan in the U. S. that is intended to qualify as a 
deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code 
and a number of savings plans internationally. Under the 401(k) savings plan, 
participating employees may elect to contribute up to90% of their eligible 
compensation, subject to certain limitations. We didno t make any contributions 
to the 401(k) savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 
2019 (other than employee deferrals of eligible compensation). Beginning in 
January 2022, we will match50% of each employee's contributions up to a maximum 
of6% (capped at $3,000) of the employee's eligible compensation, vested upon one
year of service.

| **  Recent Accounting Pronouncements** | Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In October 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-08, Accounting for Contract Assets
and Contract Liabilities from Contracts with Customers (Topic 805). This ASU 
requires an acquirer in a business combination to recognize and measure contract
assets and contract liabilities (deferred revenue) from acquired contracts using
the revenue recognition guidance in Topic 606. At the acquisition date, the 
acquirer applies the revenue model as if it had originated the acquired 
contracts. The ASU is effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 
2022, including interim periods within those fiscal years. Adoption of the ASU 
should be applied prospectively. Early adoption is also permitted, including 
adoption in an interim period. If early adopted, the amendments are applied 
retrospectively to all business combinations for which the acquisition date 
occurred during the fiscal year of adoption. This ASU is currently not expected 
to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In November 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-10, Government Assistance (Topic 
832). This ASU requires business entities to disclose information about 
government assistance they receive if the transactions were accounted for by 
analogy to either a grant or a contribution accounting model. The disclosure 
requirements include the nature of the transaction and the related accounting 
policy used, the line items on the balance sheets and statements of operations 
that are affected and the amounts applicable to each financial statement line 
item and the significant terms and conditions of the transactions. The ASU is 
effective for annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021. The disclosure 
requirements can be applied either retrospectively or prospectively to all 
transactions in the scope of the amendments that are reflected in the financial 
statements at the date of initial application and new transactions that are 
entered into after the date of initial application. The ASU is currently not 
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting 
for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting 
standards. The amendments in the ASU include removing exceptions to incremental 
intraperiod tax allocation of losses and gains from different financial 
statement components, exceptions to the method of recognizing income taxes on 
interim period losses, and exceptions to deferred tax liability recognition 
related to foreign subsidiary investments. In addition, the ASU requires that 
entities recognize franchise tax based on an incremental method and requires an 
entity to evaluate the accounting for step-ups in the tax basis of goodwill as 
inside or outside of a business combination. We adopted ASU 2019-12 starting 
2021, which did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements.

In March 2020, the FASB issued ASU No. 2020-04, Facilitation of the Effects of 
Reference Rate Reform on Financial Reporting (Topic 848). The ASU provides 
optional expedients and exceptions for applying GAAP to transactions affected by
reference rate (e. g., LIBOR) reform if certain criteria are met, for a limited 
period of time to ease the potential burden in accounting for (or recognizing 
the effects of) reference rate reform on financial reporting. The ASU is 
effective as of March 12, 2020 through December 31, 2022. We continue to 
evaluate transactions or contract modifications occurring as a result of 
reference rate reform and determine whether to apply the optional guidance on an
ongoing basis. We adopted ASU 2020-04 during 2021. The ASU has not and is 
currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial 
statements.

In May 2021, the FASB issued ASU No. 2021-04, Issuer’s Accounting for Certain 
Modifications or Exchanges of Freestanding Equity-Classified Written Call 
Options. The ASU addresses the previous lack of specific guidance in the 
accounting standards codification related to modifications or exchanges of 
freestanding equity-classified written call options (such as warrants) by 
specifying the accounting for various modification scenarios. The ASU is 
effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with
early adoption permitted for any periods after issuance to be applied as of the 
beginning of the fiscal year that includes the interim period. We adopted the 
ASU during 2021 as of the beginning of our fiscal year, which did not have a 
material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

ASU 2020-06

In August 2020, the FASB issued ASU 2020-06, Accounting for Convertible 
Instruments and Contracts in an Entity’s Own Equity. The ASU simplifies the 
accounting for convertible instruments by removing certain separation models in 
ASC 470-20, Debt - Debt with Conversion and Other Options, for convertible 
instruments. The ASU updates the guidance on certain embedded conversion 
features that are not required to be accounted for as derivatives under Topic 
815, Derivatives and Hedging, or that do not result in substantial premiums 
accounted for as paid-in capital, such that those features are no longer 
required to be separated from the host contract. The convertible debt 
instruments will be accounted for as a single liability measured at amortized 
cost. This will also result in the interest expense recognized for convertible 
debt instruments to be typically closer to the coupon interest rate when 
applying the guidance in Topic 835, Interest. Further, the ASU made amendments 
to the EPS guidance in Topic 260 for convertible debt instruments, the most 
significant impact of which is requiring the use of the if-converted method for 
diluted EPS calculation, and no longer allowing the net share settlement method.
The ASU also made revisions to Topic 815-40, which provides guidance on how an 
entity must determine whether a contract qualifies for a scope exception from 
derivative accounting. The amendments to Topic 815-40 change the scope of 
contracts that are recognized as assets or liabilities. The ASU is effective for
interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 2021, with early 
adoption permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2020. Adoption of 
the ASU can either be on a modified retrospective or full retrospective basis.

On January 1, 2021, we adopted the ASU using the modified retrospective method. 
We recognized a cumulative effect of initially applying the ASU as an adjustment
to the January 1, 2021 opening balance of accumulated deficit. Due to the 
recombination of the equity conversion component of our convertible debt 
remaining outstanding, additional paid in capital and convertible senior notes 
(mezzanine equity) were reduced. The removal of the remaining debt discounts 
recorded for this previous separation had the effect of increasing our net debt 
balance and the reduction of property, plant and equipment was related to 
previously capitalized interest. The prior period consolidated financial 
statements have not been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported 
under the accounting standards in effect for those periods.

Accordingly, the cumulative effect of the changes made on our January 1, 2021 
consolidated balance sheet for the adoption of the ASU was as follows (in 
millions):

The impact of adoption on our consolidated statements of operations for the year
ended December 31, 2021 was primarily to decrease net interest expense by $204 
million and to decrease depreciation expense by immaterial amounts. This had the
effect of increasing our basic and diluted net income per share of common stock 
attributable to common stockholders by $0.22 and $0.20, respectively, for the 
year ended December 31, 2021. The change in methodology to determine the 
denominator used in the calculation of diluted net income per share of common 
stock attributable to common stockholders contributed less than $0.01 of the 
increase by requiring the use of the if-converted method as discussed above for 
the year ended December 31, 2021.
