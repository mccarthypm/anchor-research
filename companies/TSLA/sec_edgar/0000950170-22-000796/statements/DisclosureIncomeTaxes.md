A provision for income taxes of $699 million, $292 million and $110 million has 
been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively, related primarily to our subsidiaries located outside of the U. S.

As of December 31, 2021, we recorded a valuation allowance of $9.07 billion for 
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $6.14 billion, $974 
million, and $150 million during the years ended December 31, 2021, 2020 and 
2019, respectively. The changes in valuation allowance are primarily due to 
additional U. S. deferred tax assets and liabilities incurred in the respective 
year. We have $417 million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, 
which management believes are more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given 
the expectation of future earnings in these jurisdictions. We did not have any 
material releases of valuation allowance for the years ended December 31, 2021, 
2020 and 2019. We continue to monitor the realizability of the U. S. deferred 
tax assets taking into account multiple factors. In completing this assessment, 
we considered both objective and subjective factors. These factors included, but
were not limited to, a history of losses in prior years, excess tax benefits 
related to stock-based compensation, future reversal of existing temporary 
differences and tax planning strategies. After evaluating all available 
evidence, we intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on our U.
S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the 
reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Given the improvement in 
our operating results and depending on the amount of stock-based compensation 
tax deductions available in the future, we may release the valuation allowance 
associated with the U. S. deferred tax assets in the next few years. Release of 
all, or a portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of
certain deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period 
the release is recorded.

As of December 31, 2021, we had $31.2 billion of federal and $21.6 billion of 
state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable 
income, some of which, if not utilized, will begin to expire in 2022 for federal
and state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity and 
some of the companies we acquired, and therefore are subject to change of 
control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can 
be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect the change of control 
limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.

Our 2021 net operating loss included corporate income tax deductions related to 
our CEO’s exercise of the remaining stock options from the 2012 CEO Performance 
Award, which resulted in a $23.45 billion tax deduction. Such increase in net 
operating loss is included in our deferred income tax assets, offset by a 
valuation allowance. Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code was amended for
deductibility of executive compensation for stock grants after 2017. Therefore, 
we are not expecting substantial corporate income tax deductions from our CEO's 
subsequent option exercises.

As of December 31, 2021, we had research and development tax credits of $738 
million and $584 million for federal and state income tax purposes, 
respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits 
will expire in various amounts beginning in2024. However, the state of 
California research and development tax credits can be carried forward 
indefinitely. In addition, we have other general business tax credits of $186 
million for federal income tax purposes, which will not begin to significantly 
expire until2033.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have 
determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of 
our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership 
changes.

The local government of Shanghai granted a beneficial corporate income tax rate 
of15% to certain eligible enterprises, compared to the25% statutory corporate 
income tax rate in China. Our Gigafactory Shanghai subsidiary was granted this 
beneficial income tax rate of15% for 2019 through 2023.

We constantly assess our intent to reinvest our offshore earnings. As of 
December 31, 2021, we no longer intend to reinvest certain undistributed 
earnings of our foreign entities that have been previously taxed in the U. S, 
while for the remainder of our undistributed earnings, we intend to indefinitely
reinvest. We have recorded the taxes associated with the earnings we intend to 
repatriate in the future. For the earnings we intend to indefinitely reinvest, 
no deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding or state taxes have been 
recorded. As of December 31, 2021, such undistributed earnings were 
approximately $161 million. The amount of any unrecognized deferred tax 
liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in 
millions):

  Increases in balances related to prior year tax positions         117  
  Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions        ( 90  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax positions       124

As of December 31, 2021, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial. 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $473 million, if recognized, would not affect our 
effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset 
that is currently fully offset by a valuation allowance.

We file income tax returns in the U. S., California and various state and 
foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 
years2015 to2018. Additional tax years within the periods2004 to 2014 and2019 
to2020 remain subject to examination for federal income tax purposes, and2004 
and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination for California income tax
purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject
to adjustment for U. S. federal and California income tax purposes. Our returns 
for2008 and subsequent tax years remain subject to examination in other U. S. 
state and foreign jurisdictions.

Given the uncertainty in timing and outcome of our tax examinations, an estimate
of the range of the reasonably possible change in gross unrecognized tax 
benefits within twelve months cannot be made at this time.
