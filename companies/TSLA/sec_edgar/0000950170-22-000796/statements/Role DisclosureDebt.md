There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes 
with respect to any available committed funds under our credit facilities, 
except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down, including pledging to 
our lenders sufficient amounts of qualified receivables, inventories, leased 
vehicles and our interests in those leases, solar energy systems and the 
associated customer contracts or various other assets and as may be described 
below.

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our 
subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net 
carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred financing costs. On 
January 1, 2021, we adopted ASU 2020-06 using the modified retrospective method.
As a result of this adoption, we have de-recognized the remaining debt discounts
on the 2021, 2022 and 2024 Notes and therefore no longer recognized any 
amortization of debt discounts as interest expense (see Note 2, Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies). As of December 31, 2021, we were in material 
compliance with all financial debt covenants.

2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

During the first quarter of 2021, the remaining $422 million in aggregate 
principal amount of the 2021 Notes was settled in cash for the par amount and5.3
million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable conversion 
premium. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the issuance of the 
2021 Notes were automatically settled with the respective conversions of the 
2021 Notes, resulting in the receipt of5.3 million shares of our common stock 
during the same period. Additionally, during the second and third quarters of 
2021, we fully settled the warrants entered into in connection with the issuance
of the 2021 Notes, resulting in the issuance of15.8 million shares of our common
stock.

2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of our 2022 
Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting 
transaction costs, were $966 million.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is convertible into15.2670 shares of 
our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $65.50 per share,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. As of December 
31, 2021, holders of the 2022 Notes have the option to convert. Such holders 
also had the option to convert in each quarter in 2021 due to the closing price 
of our common stock exceeding130% of the applicable conversion price on at 
least20 of the last30 consecutive trading days of the prior applicable quarter. 
We have elected to settle the principal in cash and the conversion premium in 
net shares upon a conversion. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the 
maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a 
portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to100% of the 
principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific 
corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the 
conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in connection 
with such an event in certain circumstances.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount was being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of6.00%, which is no longer applicable under ASU 2020-06.

In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase14.9 million shares
of our common stock at a price of $65.50 per share. The cost of the convertible 
note hedge transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby 
the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase14.9 million shares of 
our common stock at a price of $131.00 per share. We received $53 million in 
cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of 
the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce 
potential dilution from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively 
increase the overall conversion price from $65.50 to $131.00 per share. As these
transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and 
warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as 
derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge
and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in 
capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, $474 million in aggregate principal 
amount of the 2022 Notes was early converted and settled in cash for the par 
amount and6.5 million shares of our common stock were issued for the applicable 
conversion premium. The note hedges we entered into in connection with the 
issuance of the 2022 Notes were automatically settled with the respective 
conversions of the 2022 Notes, resulting in the receipt of6.5 million shares of 
our common stock during the same period. The related warrants will settle under 
their terms after the maturity or settlement of the 2022 Notes. As of December 
31, 2021, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal 
amount by $439 million.

2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of our 2024 
Notes in a public offering. The net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting 
transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is convertible into16.1380 shares of 
our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of $61.97 per share,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 
2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after February 15, 2024. Further,
holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, prior to February 15, 
2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) during any calendar quarter 
commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during such calendar quarter), if 
the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least20 trading days 
(whether or not consecutive) during a period of30 consecutive trading days 
ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding calendar quarter is 
greater than or equal to130% of the conversion price on each trading day; (2) 
during the five-business day period after any five-consecutive trading day 
period in which the trading price per $1,000 principal amount of the 2024 Notes 
for each trading day of such period is less than98% of the product of the last 
reported sale price of our common stock and the conversion rate on each such 
trading day, or (3) if specified corporate events occur. Upon conversion, the 
2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of our common stock or a combination 
thereof, at our election. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity 
date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of
their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to100% of the principal 
amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate 
events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate 
for a holder who elects to convert its 2024 Notes in connection with such an 
event in certain circumstances. Early conversion of notes which are scheduled to
settle in the following quarter are classified as current on our consolidated 
balance sheets.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2024 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $491 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount was being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of8.68%, which is no longer applicable under ASU 2020-06.

In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to purchase29.7 million shares
of our common stock at a price of $61.97 per share. The cost of the convertible 
note hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby 
the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase29.7 million shares of 
our common stock at a price of $121.50 per share. We received $174 million in 
cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of 
the convertible note hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce 
potential dilution from the conversion of the 2024 Notes and to effectively 
increase the overall conversion price from $61.97 to $121.50 per share. As these
transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and 
warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as 
derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge
and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in 
capital on the consolidated balance sheet.

The closing price of our common stock exceeded130% of the applicable conversion 
price on at least20 of the last30 consecutive trading days of each quarter in 
2021, causing the 2024 Notes to be convertible by their holders in the 
subsequent quarter. During the year ended December 31, 2021, $1.19 billion in 
aggregate principal amount of the 2024 Notes was early converted and settled in 
cash for the par amount and17.6 million shares of our common stock were issued 
for the applicable conversion premium. The note hedges we entered into in 
connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes were automatically settled with 
the respective conversions of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the receipt of17.6 
million shares of our common stock during the same period. Additionally, during 
the year ended December 31, 2021, we partially settled the warrants entered into
in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the issuance 
of21.4 million shares of our common stock. As of December 31, 2021, the 
if-converted value of the notes exceeds the outstanding principal amount by 
$1.46 billion.

2025 Notes

In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of the 
2025 Notes pursuant to Rule 144A and Regulation S under the Securities Act. The 
net proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.77 
billion. During the year ended December 31, 2021, we fully repaid the $ 1.80 
billion in aggregate principal of the 2025 Notes and recorded an extinguishment 
of debt charge of $ 60 million related to the redemption in Interest expense in 
the consolidated statement of operations.

Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement 
(as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of 
banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a)1% 
plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus0.50%, (ii) the 
lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts

Automotive Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to 
certain leased vehicles into special purpose entities (“SPEs”) and issue 
Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive assets to investors. 
The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The cash flows generated 
by these automotive assets are used to service the principal and interest 
payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, 
and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize 
revenue earned from the associated customer lease contracts in accordance with 
our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not 
available to our other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the 
Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets.

During the year ended December 31, 2021, we transferred beneficial interests 
related to certain leased vehicles into SPEs and issued $1.98 billion in 
aggregate principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar 
to our other, previously issued, Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds 
from the issuances, net of discounts and fees, were $1.97 billion.

in the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these solar assets and 
notes receivable, or distributed by the underlying financing funds to certain 
SPEs are used to service the principal and interest payments on the Solar Asset 
and Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is 
distributed to us. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our 
other creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset and 
Loan-backed Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. We contracted 
with certain SPEs to provide operations & maintenance and administrative
