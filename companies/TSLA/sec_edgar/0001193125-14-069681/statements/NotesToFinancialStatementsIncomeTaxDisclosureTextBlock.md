Management
believes that based on the available information, it is more likely
than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, such
that a full valuation allowance is required against all U. S.
deferred tax assets.

As of
December 31, 2013, we had approximately $1.13 billion of
federal and $663.5 million of California operating loss
carry-forwards available to offset future taxable income, $246.0
million of which is associated with windfall tax benefits that will
be recorded as additional paid-in capital when realized. These
carryforwards will expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 for
federal and 2019 for state if unused. Additionally, we have
research and development tax credits of approximately $23.5 million
and $26.1 million for federal and state income tax purposes,
respectively. If not utilized, the federal carry-forwards will
expire in various amounts beginning in 2019. However, the state
credits can be carried forward indefinitely.

We have
indefinitely reinvested $5.1 million of undistributed earnings of
our foreign operations outside of our U. S. tax jurisdiction as of
December 31, 2013. No deferred tax liability has been
recognized for the remittance of such earnings to the United States
since it is our intention to utilize these earnings to fund future
foreign expansions including but not limited to, hiring of
additional personnel, capital purchases, expansion into larger
facilities, and potential new dealerships.

Federal and
state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization
of net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of
an “ownership change,” as defined in Section 382
of the Internal Revenue Code. We performed a study and had
determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the
utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards
as a result of prior ownership changes.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

The aggregate
changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits
during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 were
as follows (in thousands):

  December 31,                                            16,393  
  Increases in balances                                    1,037  
  December 31,                                            17,430  
  Increases in balances                                      640  
  December 31,                                            18,070  
  Decreases in balances                                   (7,802  
  Increases in balances                                    3,102  
  December 31,                                            13,370  

The decreases
in our gross unrecognized tax benefit during the year ended
December 31, 2013 primarily related to prior year errors
identified in the current year. Accrued interest and penalties
related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as income tax
expense and was immaterial. As of December 31, 2013,
unrecognized tax benefits of $11.8 million, if recognized, would
not affect our effective tax rate as the tax benefits would
increase a deferred tax asset which is currently fully offset with
a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate that the amount of
existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly increase or
decrease within the next 12 months. We file income tax returns in
the United States, California, various states and foreign
jurisdictions. Tax years 2003 to 2012 remain subject to examination
for federal purposes, and tax years 2003 to 2012 remain subject to
examination for California purposes. All net operating losses and
tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for U. S.
federal and California purposes. Tax years 2007 to 2012 remain open
for examination in other U. S. state and foreign
jurisdictions.
