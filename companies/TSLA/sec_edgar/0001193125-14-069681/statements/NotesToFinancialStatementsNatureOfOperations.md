Company

Tesla Motors,
Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of
Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and
sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric
vehicle powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in
North America, Europe and Asia.  The primary purpose of these
subsidiaries is to market, manufacture, sell and/or service our
vehicles.

Correction of Prior Year
Amounts

In conjunction
with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the year ended
December 31, 2012 filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission (SEC) on March 7, 2013, we revised our consolidated
statement of cash flows for the year ended December 31, 2011
to correct an immaterial error. Amounts related to purchases of
property and equipment during 2011 that were not paid as of
December 31, 2011 were erroneously included as cash outflows
from investing activities in our previously issued financial
statements. This revision resulted in a $13.7 million decrease in
purchases of property and equipment included in cash flows used in
investing activities and a corresponding increase in the change in
accounts payable resulting in an increase in cash flows used in
operating activities. We also revised our supplemental disclosure
of noncash acquisition of property and equipment by an increase of
$12.9 million for 2011.

There was no
impact on previously reported total cash and cash equivalents,
consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of
operations.
