Deposits

Customer
deposits consist of payments that allow potential customers to
place an order for the future purchase of a Model S or Model X.
These amounts are recorded as current liabilities until the vehicle
is delivered. We require full payment of the purchase price of the
vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer. Amounts
received by us as customer deposits are generally not restricted as
to their use by us. Upon delivery of the vehicle, the related
customer deposits are applied against the customer’s total
purchase price for the vehicle and recognized in automotive sales
as part of the respective vehicle sale.

Historically,
we have referred to such customer deposits as reservation payments
and these initial reservation payments have been fully refundable
until such time that the customer selected the vehicle
specifications and entered into a purchase agreement. We have
eliminated the reservation process for Model S in North America and
in most of our markets in Europe, as vehicle production became more
reliable and customer wait times decreased. Customers now initiate
their purchase by ordering their customized Model S rather than
placing a generic reservation in queue. As a result of this
transition away from reservations, we have renamed the
“reservation payments” caption on our consolidated
financial statements to “customer deposits.” Customer
deposits related to Model X still represent fully refundable
reservations.

As of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, we held customer deposits of
$163.2 million and $138.8 million, respectively.
