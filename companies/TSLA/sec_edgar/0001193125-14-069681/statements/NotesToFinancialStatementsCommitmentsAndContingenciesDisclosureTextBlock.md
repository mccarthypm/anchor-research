Our corporate

Alto, California where we have leased a facility consisting of
350,000 square feet. This lease expires in January 2020. We have
leased a 203,772 square feet manufacturing facility in Tilburg,

Rent expense
for the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $21.5
million, $12.1 million and $8.6 million,
respectively.

Capital
Leases

We have entered
into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases
over terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases
are collateral for the lease obligations and are included within
property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance
sheets under the categories of computer equipment and software and
office furniture and equipment.

Future minimum

Environmental Liabilities

In May 2010, we
entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile
production facility located in Fremont, California from New United
Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI has previously identified
environmental conditions at the Fremont site which could affect
soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts
to address these conditions. These conditions are now being
addressed by us and NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI
that it has documented and managed the environmental issues and we
completed a reasonable level of diligence on such environmental
issues at the time we purchased the facility, we cannot determine
the potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination
with any certainty. Based on management’s best estimate, at
the time of the facility purchase, we estimated the fair value of
the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million.
The fair value of these liabilities was determined based on an
expected value analysis of the related potential costs to
investigate, remediate and manage various environmental conditions
that were identified as part of NUMMI’s facility
decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence
efforts.

We reached an
agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will
pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any
governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination
that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land
purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions, and
NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such remediation
activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up
to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are
incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our
reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the
closing. Through December 31 2013, remediation costs of $2.1
million had been incurred by NUMMI; therefore, we classified $2.1
million of our $5.3 million environmental liabilities to accrued
liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2013.

On the ten-year
anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent
on the remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI’s
liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and
we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the
Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and we have
released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for
NUMMI’s obligations for representations and warranties under
the agreement. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we accrued a
total of $5.5 million and $5.3 million related to these
environmental liabilities, respectively. As we continue with our
construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible
that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change
materially.

From time to
time, we are subject to various legal proceedings that arise from
the normal course of business activities. In addition, from time to
time, third parties may assert intellectual property infringement
claims against us in the form of letters and other forms of
communication. If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists
the possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of
operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and
brand.

In November
2013, a putative securities class action lawsuit was filed against
Tesla in U. S. District Court, Northern District of California,
alleging violations of, and seeking remedies pursuant to, Sections
10(b) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 and Rule
10b-5. The claims were originally asserted against Tesla and two of
its executive officers. The current complaint seeks damages,
attorney fees and other relief, and alleges, among other things,
that Tesla made false and/or misleading representations and
omissions including with respect to the safety of the Model S
vehicle and Tesla’s ability to meet public expectations with
respect to its financial performance. The current complaint is
brought on behalf of a putative class consisting of “all
persons other than Defendants who purchased Tesla’s
securities between May 10, 2013 and November 6, 2013,
inclusive.” We believe this lawsuit is without merit and
intend to defend against this class action vigorously.
