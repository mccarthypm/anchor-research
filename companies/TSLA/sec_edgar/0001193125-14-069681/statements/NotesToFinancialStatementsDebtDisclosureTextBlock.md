Long-term Debt Obligations

1.50%  Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and
Warrant Transactions

In May 2013, we
issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of Notes in a
public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after
deducting transaction costs, were approximately
$648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million of debt
issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the Notes which
we recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense
using the effective interest method over the contractual term of
the Notes. The interest under the Notes is fixed at 1.50% per
annum and is payable semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and
December 1 of each year, commencing on December 1, 2013.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $1.2
million of interest expense related to the amortization of debt
issuance costs and $5.9 million of coupon interest
expense.

Each $1,000 of
principal of the Notes will initially be convertible into
8.0306 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an
initial conversion price of approximately $124.52 per share,
subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events.
Holders of the Notes may convert their Notes at their option on or
after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the Notes may convert
their Notes at their option prior to March 1, 2018, only under
the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter
beginning after the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2013,
if the last reported sale price of our common stock for at least 20
trading days (whether or not consecutive) during the last
30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding
fiscal quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion
price on each applicable trading day; (2) during the five
business day period following any five consecutive trading day
period in which the trading price for the Notes is less than 98% of
the average of the closing sale price of our common stock for each
day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make
specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if
specified corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would
pay the holders in cash for the principal amount of the Notes and,
if applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to
deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our
common stock) based on a calculated daily conversion value. If a
fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of
the Notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their
Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal
amount of the Notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In
addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity
date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects
to convert its Notes in connection with such a corporate event in
certain circumstances.

We valued and
bifurcated the conversion option associated with the Notes from the
host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $82.8
million in stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discount
on the Notes is being amortized to interest expense at an effective
interest rate of 4.29% over the contractual term of the Notes.
During the year ended December 31, 2013, we recognized $9.1
million of interest expense related to the amortization of the debt
discount. As of December 31, 2013, the net carrying value of
the Notes was $586.3 million.

In connection
with the offering of the Notes, we entered into convertible note
hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase up to
5.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of
approximately $124.52 per share. The cost of the convertible note
hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition, we sold
warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to
purchase up to approximately 5.3 million shares of our common
stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received
$120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these
warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note
hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to offset any actual
dilution from the conversion of the Notes and to effectively
increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per
share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the
convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in
stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as
derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a
reduction to additional paid-in capital in the consolidated balance
sheet as of December 31, 2013.

During the
fourth quarter of 2013, the closing price of our common stock did
not meet or exceed 130% of the applicable conversion price of our
Notes on at least 20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the
quarter; furthermore, no other conditions allowing holders of the
Notes to convert have been met as of December 31, 2013.
Therefore, the Notes are not convertible during the first quarter
of 2014 and are classified as long-term debt. Should the closing
price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2014 or a future
quarter, the Notes will be convertible at their holders’
option during the immediately following quarters.

Full Repayment of
Department of Energy Loan Facility

In
May 2013, in connection with the closing of our offerings of
common stock and Notes, we paid $451.8 million to settle all
outstanding loan amounts of $441.0 million, including principal and
interest, as well as an early repayment penalty of $10.8 million
which was recorded in interest expense for the year ended
December 31, 2013. Upon termination of the DOE Loan Facility,
$29.3 million held in this dedicated account was released by the
DOE.

On
January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the
Federal Financing Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the Advanced
Technology Vehicles Manufacturing (ATVM) Incentive Program. This
loan facility was amended in June 2011 to expand our cash
investment options, in February 2012 to modify the timing of
certain future financial covenants and funding of the debt service
reserve account, and in June and December 2012 to allow us to
effect certain initiatives in our business plan. In September 2012,
we entered into an amendment with the DOE to remove our obligation
to comply with the current ratio financial covenant as of
September 30, 2012 and amend the timing of pre-funding the
principal payment due in June 2013. We entered into another
amendment with the DOE in March 2013 that, among other things,
modified certain future financial covenants, accelerated the
maturity date of the DOE Loan Facility to December 15, 2017,
created an obligation to repay approximately 1.0% of the
outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before
June 15, 2013, and created additional contingent obligations
based on excess cash flows that may result in accelerated repayment
of the DOE Loan Facility starting in 2015. The original
amortization schedule for the DOE Loan Facility was not affected by
this amendment, and so the debt service payments remained the same
until the new maturity date when all outstanding loans under the
DOE Loan Facility were to be repaid. We refer to the loan facility
with the DOE, as amended, as the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE
Loan Facility, the FFB made available to us two multi-draw term
loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of $465.0 million.
As of August 31, 2012, we had fully drawn down the
aforementioned facilities.

All outstanding
amounts under the DOE Loan Facility were repayable in quarterly
installments, which commenced on December 15, 2012 and would
be due on the maturity date of December 15, 2017. All
obligations under the DOE Loan Facility were secured by
substantially all of our property.

The DOE Loan
Facility documents contained customary covenants that included,
among others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in
accordance with the business plan for such project, compliance with
all requirements of the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and
our subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens,
make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions,
dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital
stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees
to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter
into new lines of business, and enter into certain restrictive
agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The DOE
Loan Facility documents also contained customary financial
covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current
assets to current liabilities, and (i) a limit on capital
expenditures, (ii) from December 31, 2013, a maximum
leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed
charge coverage ratio, and (iii) from March 31, 2014, a
maximum ratio of total liabilities to shareholder equity. We were
in compliance with our current applicable financial covenants as of
March 31, 2013. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contained
customary events of default, subject in some cases to customary
cure periods for certain defaults. In addition, events of default
included a failure of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO),
and certain of his affiliates, at any time prior to one year after
we would complete the project relating to the Model S Facility, to
own at least 65% of capital stock held by Mr.  Musk and such
affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility. As part of the
amendment to the DOE Loan Facility in March 2013, we agreed to,
among other things, (i) make an early payment of approximately
1.0% of the outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or
before June 15, 2013, (ii) make additional quarterly
prepayments equal to: 20% of our excess cash flow for each quarter
of fiscal 2015; and 35% of our excess cash flow for each quarter of
fiscal 2016 and 2017.

Under the DOE
Loan Facility, we had agreed to pre-fund a dedicated debt service
reserve account with our planned loan repayments as required by the
DOE loan facility. As of December 31, 2012, $14.9 million was
held in this dedicated account and classified this cash as current
restricted cash on the consolidated balance sheet.

DOE Warrant
Expiration

In connection
with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we issued in January
2010 a warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our
Series  E convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of
$2.51 per share. Upon the completion of our initial public offering
on July 2, 2010, this preferred stock warrant became a warrant
to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common stock at an exercise
price of $7.54 per share. Since the number of shares ultimately
issuable under the warrants would vary depending on the average
outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual vesting
period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future
stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation
to market interest rates, we had historically measured the fair
value of the warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The
Monte Carlo approach simulates and captures the optimal decisions
to be made between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of
the DOE warrant. For the purposes of the simulation, the optimal
decision represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to
us. The total warrant value would then be calculated as the average
warrant payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our
valuation date. The prepayment feature which allowed us to prepay
the DOE Loan Facility, and consequently affected the number of
shares ultimately issuable under the DOE warrant, was determined to
represent an embedded derivative. This embedded derivative was
inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant
liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the fair
value of the embedded derivative were reflected as part of the
warrant liability re-measurement to fair value at each balance
sheet reporting date. The warrant was recorded at its estimated
fair value with changes in its fair value reflected in other income
(expense), net, until its expiration or vesting. As of
December 31, 2012, the fair value of the DOE warrant was $10.7
million. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we
recognized expense for the change in the fair value of the DOE
warrant in the amount of $1.9 million and $2.8 million through
other income (expense), net, in the consolidated statements of
operations, respectively. The fair value of the warrant at issuance
was $6.3 million, and along with the DOE Loan Facility fee of
$0.5 million and other debt issuance costs of $0.9 million,
represented a cost of closing the loan facility and was being
amortized to interest expense over the expected term of the DOE
Loan Facility. During the years ended December 31, 2012 and
2011, we amortized $0.6 million to interest expense,
respectively.

As a result of
our repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the
DOE Loan Facility and the termination of the DOE Loan Facility in
May 2013, the DOE warrant expired. As such, we recognized other
income for the change in the fair value of the DOE warrant in the
amount of $10.7 million for the year ended December 31,
2013. Additionally, we amortized all remaining unamortized debt
issuance costs of $5.8 million related to the DOE Loan Facility to
interest expense for the year ended December 31,
2013.
