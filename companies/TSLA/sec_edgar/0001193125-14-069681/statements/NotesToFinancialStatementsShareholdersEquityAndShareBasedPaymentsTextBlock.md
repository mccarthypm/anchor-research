Plans

In July 2003,
we adopted the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the
effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on
June 28, 2010, we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the
Plan) and all remaining common shares reserved for future grant or
issuance under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan were added to the
2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the granting of
stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights to our employees,
directors and consultants. Options granted under the Plan may be
either incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive
stock options may be granted only to our employees including
officers and directors. Nonqualified stock options and stock
purchase rights may be granted to our employees and consultants.
Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and are
exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten
years from the date the stock options are granted. Continued
vesting typically terminates when the employment or consulting
relationship ends. As of December 31, 2013, 23,318,526 shares
of common stock were reserved for issuance under the
Plan.

The following
table summarizes stock option and RSU activity under the
Plan:

In addition to
stock options issued from the Plan, there were 33,333 stock options
as of December 31, 2011, that we had previously granted to
non-employees outside of the Plan. These outstanding non-employee
options had a weighted average exercise price of $1.80 as of
December 31, 2011. During the year ended December 31,
2012, these stock options were fully exercised.

The aggregate
intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i. e.,
the difference between our common stock price and the exercise
price, multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would
have been received by the option holders had all option holders
exercised their options. The aggregate intrinsic value of options
outstanding as of December 31, 2013 and 2012 was $2.80 billion
and $317.7 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of options
exercisable was $1.48 billion and $233.3 million, and the intrinsic
value of options vested and expected to vest was $2.80 billion and
$280.7 million as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
The total intrinsic value of options exercised was $294.0 million
and $35.1 million for the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012, respectively. The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs
outstanding as of December 31, 2013 was $101.9
million.

Fair Value
Adoption

We utilize the
fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense.
Under the fair value method, we estimated the fair value of each
option award and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the
Black-Scholes option pricing model and the weighted average
assumptions noted in the following table.

The
weighted-average grant-date fair value for option awards granted
during the years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was
$40.72, $16.37 and $17.43 per share, respectively. The
weighted-average grant-date fair value for ESPP granted during the
years ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011 was $19.22, $8.99
and $7.52 per share, respectively. The fair value of RSUs is
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value
of our common stock.

Performance-Based Stock
Options

In December
2009, our Board of Directors approved an option grant to our CEO
representing 4% of our fully-diluted share base prior to such grant
as of the grant date, or 3,355,986 stock options, with 1/4th of the
shares vesting immediately, and 1/36th of the remaining shares
scheduled to vest each month over three years, assuming continued
employment through each vesting date in recognition of his and our
company’s achievements and to create incentives for future
success. In addition, to create incentives for the attainment of
clear performance objectives around a key element of our business
plan - the successful launch and commercialization of Model
S - the Board of Directors approved an additional option grant
to our CEO totaling an additional 4% of our fully-diluted shares
prior to such grant as of the grant date, or 3,355,986 stock
options, with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment
of performance objectives as follows, assuming our CEO’s
continued employment and service to us through each vesting
date:

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest  
  upon the successful completion of Model S Engineering            
  Prototype;                                                       
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest

  Prototype;                                                       
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest  

Through
December 31, 2013, all performance milestones were achieved.
Stock-based compensation expense related to this grant to our CEO
was $0.4 million, $4.2 million and $6.3 million for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Our Board of
Directors also approved option grants in June and September 2010 to
purchase our common stock of 666,300 and 20,000, respectively, to
various members of our senior management with a vesting schedule
based entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives
as those outlined for our CEO above. During the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, we recognized $0.8 million,
$1.4 million and $4.9 million, respectively, of stock-based
compensation expense related to the attainment of these performance
objectives.

In August 2012,
our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock options to our CEO
(2012 CEO Grant). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of ten vesting
tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment
of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming
continued employment and service to us through each vesting
date.

Each of the
vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten
pre-determined performance milestones outlined below and an
incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion,
as compared to the initial market capitalization of $3.2 billion
measured at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant.

  Successful completion of the Model X Engineering Prototype  
  (Alpha);                                                    
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X Vehicle Prototype  
  (Beta);                                                 
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  Successful completion of the Gen III Engineering Prototype  
  (Alpha);                                                    
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Gen III Vehicle Prototype  
  (Beta);                                                 
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Gen III Production Vehicle;  

  Gross margin of 30% or more for four consecutive  
  quarters;                                         
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles;  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 200,000 vehicles;  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 300,000 vehicles.  

The term of the
2012 CEO Grant is ten years, so any tranches that remain unvested
at the expiration of the 2012 CEO Grant will be forfeited. In
addition, unvested options will be forfeited if our CEO is no
longer in that role, whether for cause or otherwise. Based on our
current market valuation, we believe that the first two tranches of
the 2012 CEO Grant (for successful completion of the Alpha and Beta
Model X Prototypes) will vest during 2014.

We measured the
fair value of the 2012 CEO Grant using a Monte Carlo simulation
approach with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of
1.65%, expected term of ten years, expected volatility of 55% and
dividend yield of 0%.

Stock-based
compensation expense associated with the 2012 CEO Grant is
recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over
the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance
and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the
relevant performance condition is considered probable of being
met.

As of
December 31, 2013, the market conditions for three vesting
tranches were achieved and the following three performance
milestones were considered probable of achievement:

  Successful completion of the Model X Engineering Prototype  
  (Alpha);                                                    
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X Vehicle Prototype  
  (Beta);                                                 
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle.  

None of the
stock options granted under the 2012 CEO Grant has vested thus far
as the performance milestones have not yet been achieved as of
December 31, 2013.

Additionally,
no cash compensation has been received by our CEO for his services
to the company.

We realized no
income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the
periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances.
As required, we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of
stock options, if any, as financing cash flows rather than
operating cash flows.

As of
December 31, 2013, we had $227.3 million of total
unrecognized compensation expense, net, of estimated forfeitures,
that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 5.2
years.
