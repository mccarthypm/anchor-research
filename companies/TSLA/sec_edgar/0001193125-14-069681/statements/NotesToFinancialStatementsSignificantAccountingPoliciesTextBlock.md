Significant Accounting Policies

Basis of
Consolidation

The
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Tesla and
its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant inter-company
transactions and balances have been eliminated in
consolidation.

Use of
Estimates

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period, including
revenue recognition, residual value of operating lease vehicles,
inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial
instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results could
differ from those estimates.

Revenue
Recognition

We recognize
revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including
vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of
regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle (ZEV) and
greenhouse gas emission (GHG) credits, as well as sales of electric
vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs
and drive units and sales of services related to the development of
these systems. We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred
and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance;
(iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection
is reasonably assured.

For multiple
deliverable revenue arrangements, we allocate revenue to each
element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a
deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence
(VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not
available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is
available.

Automotive Sales

sales consisted of the following for the periods presented (in
thousands):

Automotive
sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sales of the
Model S, Tesla Roadster, vehicle service, and vehicle options,
accessories and destination charges as well as sales of regulatory
credits. Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the
sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such
as battery packs and drive units, to other automotive
manufacturers. Sales or other amounts collected in advance of
meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized
in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead
recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance
sheets.

In regards to
the sale of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, revenue is generally
recognized when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred
to our customers. In certain circumstances, we may deliver a
vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered by the
customer if the options do not limit the functionality of the
vehicle. In such cases, we will continue to defer the related
revenue based on the undelivered item’s fair value, as
evidenced by the contractual price of the option in stand-alone
transactions, where available, or using the selling price hierarchy
where such prices do not exist. Additionally, if a customer
purchases a vehicle option that requires us to provide services in
the future, we will defer the related revenue based on the
undelivered items’ fair value and recognize the associated
revenue over our expected performance period.

While the sale
of vehicle option may take place separately from a vehicle sale,
they are often part of a single vehicle sales agreement resulting
in multiple element arrangements. To determine the appropriate
accounting for recognition of our revenue, we consider whether the
deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should
be treated as separate units of accounting, and, if so, how the
price should be allocated among the elements, when to recognize
revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should
be recognized. We also evaluate whether a delivered item has value
on a stand-alone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by
determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or
whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of
the delivered items. Further, we assess whether we know the fair
value of the undelivered items, determined by reference to
stand-alone sales of such items. To date, we have generally been
able to establish the fair value for each of the deliverables
within these multiple element arrangements because we sell each of
the vehicles, vehicle accessories and options separately, outside
of any multiple element arrangements. As each of these items has
stand-alone value to the customer, revenue from sales of vehicle
accessories and options are recognized when those specific items
are delivered to the customer. In the case of access to our
Supercharger network and connectivity, we use our best estimate of
selling price and TPE, respectively, to allocate fair value to the
deliverables to be recognized over our expected performance period.
As of December 31, 2013, we had deferred $10.3 million related
to access to our Supercharger network and $0.7 million related to
connectivity.

Resale
Value Guarantee

In April 2013,
we began offering a resale value guarantee to all customers who
purchased a Model S in the United States and financed their vehicle
through one of our specified commercial banking partners, and in
October 2013, we introduced this program in Canada. Under the
program, Model S customers have the option of selling their vehicle
back to us during the period of 36 to 39 months after delivery for
a pre-determined resale value. Although we receive the full amount
of cash for the vehicle sales price at delivery, we account for
transactions under the resale value guarantee program as operating
leases. Accordingly, we defer and amortize to automotive sales
revenue the initial purchase consideration less resale value
guarantee amount on a straight-line basis, over the contractual
term of the guarantee program (i. e., the proxy operating lease
term). Similarly, we capitalize and depreciate the cost of the
respective operating lease vehicles less expected salvage value to
cost of automotive sales over the same period. If a customer
decides not to sell their vehicle back to us by the end of the
resale value guarantee term, or the resale value guarantee is
forfeited, any unamortized deferred revenue (including the amount
of the resale value guarantee) and operating lease vehicle net book
value is then recognized in automotive sales and cost of automotive
sales, respectively.

The resale
value guarantee amount represents management’s best estimate
as to the resale value of the Model S vehicle and related vehicle
options during the 36 to 39 month period after delivery. Since we
are depreciating our operating lease vehicles to the resale value
guarantee amount, which approximates the expected salvage value of
our operating lease vehicles at the end of their economic useful
life (i. e. the end of their expected operating lease term), we will
adjust our depreciation estimates as needed, if the expected
salvage value is projected to be lower in future periods. As we
accumulate more actual data related to the resale experience of
Model S, we may be required to make significant changes to our
estimates.

Regulatory Credits Sales

California and
certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered
for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission
vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of
zero emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits, and may sell
excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to
comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations
exist at the federal level that require compliance related to GHG
emissions and also allow for the sale of excess credits by one
manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a manufacturer solely of
zero emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as
ZEV and GHG credits on vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn
these credits in the future. Since all of our commercial vehicles
are electric, we do not receive any compliance benefit from the
generation of these credits, and accordingly look to sell them to
other vehicle manufacturers. In order to facilitate the sale of
these credits, we enter into contractual agreements with third
parties requiring them to purchase our regulatory credits at
pre-determined prices. We recognize revenue on the sale of these
credits at the time legal title to the credits is transferred to
the purchasing party by the governmental agency issuing the
credits. Revenue from the sale of regulatory credits totaled $194.4
million, $40.5 million and $2.7 million for the years ended
December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

Maintenance and Service Plans

We offer a
prepaid maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans
covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles,
provided these services are purchased within a specified period of
time. The maintenance plans cover annual inspections and the
replacement of wear and tear parts, excluding tires and the
battery, with either a fixed fee per visit for Tesla Ranger service
or unlimited Tesla Ranger visits for a higher initial purchase
price. Payments collected in advance of the performance of service
are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated
balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our
performance obligations.

We also offer
an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement of
Model S parts for an additional four years or up to an additional
50,000 miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited
Warranty, provided they are purchased within a specified period of
time. For customers that are not covered by our New Vehicle Limited
Warranties or our extended service plans, we offer Tesla Ranger
service at a higher cost. Payments collected in advance of the
performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues
on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive
sales ratably over the service coverage periods.

As of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had deferred $27.3 million and
$1.5 million, respectively, related to our maintenance and service
plans. During the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we
recognized revenue of $0.7 million and $0.1 million related to
these plans, respectively.

We provided
Tesla Roadster customers with the opportunity to purchase an
extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our initial
New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an
additional three years or 36,000 miles. We refer to this program as
our Extended Service plan. Amounts collected on these sales are
initially recorded in deferred revenues on the consolidated balance
sheets and recognized in automotive sales over the extended
warranty period. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had
deferred $1.6 million and $1.5 million, respectively. During
the years ended December 31, 2013 and 2012, we recognized
revenue of $0.3 million and $0.5 million related to this program,
respectively.

Additionally,
we have previously provided customers of our Tesla Roadsters with a
one-time option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at
any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty
but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their
vehicles. We refer to this program as our Battery Replacement
program. Amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in
deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized
in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the
battery packs. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we had
deferred $1.3 million and $1.2 million, respectively, related to
the Battery Replacement program and have not yet recognized any
related revenues.

Development Services Revenue

Revenue from
development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from
the development of electric vehicle powertrain components and
systems for other automobile manufacturers, including the design
and development of battery packs, drive units and sample vehicles
to meet a customer’s specifications. Revenue is recognized as
the performance requirements of each development arrangement are
met and collection is reasonably assured. Where development
arrangements include substantive at-risk milestones, revenue is
recognized based upon the achievement of the contractually-defined
milestones. Amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the
revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred
revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs of development
services are expensed as incurred. When development services
arrangements have multiple elements, we evaluate the separability
of the various deliverables to ensure appropriate revenue
recognition. Costs of development services incurred in periods
prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research
and development expenses; once an agreement is finalized, these
costs are recorded in cost of revenues.

Cash and Cash
Equivalents

All highly
liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three
months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents. We currently invest excess cash primarily in money
market funds.

Marketable
Securities

Marketable
securities have historically been comprised of commercial paper and
corporate debt and are all designated as available-for-sale and
reported at estimated fair value, with unrealized gains and losses
recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss which is included
within stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on the
sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in
other income (expense), net. The cost of available-for-sale
marketable securities sold is based on the specific identification
method. Interest, dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase
premiums and discounts on our marketable securities are included in
other income (expense), net. Available-for-sale marketable
securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of
purchase and remaining maturities of one year or less are
classified as short-term marketable securities. Where temporary
declines in fair value exist, we have the ability and the intent to
hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for
any anticipated recovery in fair value.

When held, we
regularly review all of our marketable securities for
other-than-temporary declines in fair value. The review includes
but is not limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of
the impairment, (ii) the creditworthiness of the security
issuers, (iii) the length of time a security is in an
unrealized loss position, and (iv) our ability to hold the
security for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in fair value.

Restricted Cash and
Deposits

We maintain
certain cash amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. We
maintained total restricted cash of $9.4 million and $24.3 million
as of December 31, 2013 and 2012, respectively. Restricted
cash as of December 31, 2012 primarily represented cash held
in separate dedicated accounts required under our Department of
Energy (DOE) loan facility (see Note 6) and was used as a mechanism
to defer advances under the DOE loan facility as well as to
pre-fund planned loan repayments. Upon termination of the DOE loan
facility in May 2013, $29.3 million held in these dedicated
accounts were released by the DOE. Current and noncurrent
restricted cash as of December 31, 2013 was comprised
primarily of security deposits held by vendors as part of the
vendors’ standard credit policies, security deposits related
to lease agreements and equipment financing, and certain refundable
customer deposits segregated in accordance with state consumer
protection regulations.

Accounts Receivable and
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts
receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain
systems and regulatory credits to other global automotive
manufacturers (OEMs). In circumstances where we are aware of a
specific customer’s inability to meet its financial
obligations to us, we provide an allowance against amounts
receivable to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount we
reasonably believe will be collected. We typically do not carry
accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related sales as
customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery, except for the
amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved
financing arrangements between our customers and the financial
institutions.

Concentration of
Risk

Credit
Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of
credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and
accounts receivable. Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in
money market funds with high credit quality financial institutions
in the United States. At times, these deposits and securities may
be in excess of insured limits. We invest cash not required for use
in operations in high credit quality securities based on our
investment policy. Our investment policy provides guidelines and
limits regarding credit quality, investment concentration,
investment type, and maturity that we believe will provide
liquidity while reducing risk of loss of capital. Historically,
when held, investments were of a short-term nature and included
investments in corporate debt securities.

As of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, our accounts receivable were
derived primarily from sales of regulatory credits, as well as the
development and sales of powertrain components and systems to OEMs.
Accounts receivable also included amounts to be received from
commercial financial institutions for approved financing
arrangements between our customers and the financial
institutions.

The following
summarizes the accounts receivable from our OEM customers in excess
of 10% of our total accounts receivable:

                  December 31,              December 31,          
                  2013                      2012

  Customer A                        30                        56  
  Customer B                         9                        15  

Supply
Risk

Although there
may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used in
our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these
single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a
timely basis at competitive prices, we could suffer manufacturing
delays, a possible loss of revenues, or incur higher cost of sales,
any of which could adversely affect our operating
results.

Inventories and
Inventory Valuation

Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using
standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in,
first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs based on reviews
for excess and obsolescence determined primarily by future demand
forecasts. We also adjust the carrying value of our inventories
when we believe that the net realizable value is less than the
carrying value. These write-downs are measured as the difference
between the cost of the inventory, including estimated costs to
complete, and estimated selling prices. Once inventory is written
down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established,
and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in
the restoration or increase in that newly established cost
basis.

Property, Plant and
Equipment

Property, plant
and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as
follows:

  Computer equipment and           3 years        
  Office furniture, machinery      3 to 12 years  
  Building and building            30 years       

Depreciation
for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method
whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated
productive life of the related assets. During the year ended
December 31, 2013, we increased the estimated productive life
for tooling from 125,000 vehicles to 150,000 vehicles based on our
current estimates of production.

Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related
lease.

Upon the
retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost
and related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance
sheet and the resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations.
Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred, while
major improvements that increase functionality of the asset are
capitalized and depreciated ratably to expense over the identified
useful life. Land is not depreciated.

Interest
expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on
construction in progress is included in property, plant and
equipment, and is amortized over the life of the related
assets.

Operating Lease
Vehicles

Vehicles
delivered under our resale value guarantee program, vehicles that
are leased as part of our leasing program as well as any vehicles
that are sold with a significant buy-back guarantee are classified
as operating lease vehicles as the related revenue transactions are
treated as operating leases. Operating lease vehicles are recorded
at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed
using the straight-line method over the expected operating lease
term. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded in the
consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2013 and 2012
was $401.9 million and $13.4 million, respectively. Accumulated
depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31,
2013 and 2012 was $19.5 million and $3.3 million,
respectively.

Intangible
Assets

Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated
useful lives. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, intangible
assets were comprised of emission permits related to our Tesla
Factory. Although these emission permits have a longer useful life
than the Tesla Factory, they are related to the operation of our
Tesla Factory and therefore, are amortized over the same useful
life.

Long-lived
Assets

We evaluate our
long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for indicators of
possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not
be recoverable. Impairment exists if the carrying amounts of such
assets exceed the estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows
expected to be generated by such assets. Should impairment exist,
the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess carrying
value of the asset over the asset’s estimated fair value. As
of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we did not record any material
impairment losses on our long-lived assets.

Research and Development
Costs

Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development expenses consist primarily of payroll, benefits and
stock-based compensation of those employees engaged in research,
design and development activities, costs related to design tools,
license expenses related to intellectual property, supplies and
services, depreciation and other occupancy costs. Also included in
research and development are development services costs incurred,
if any, prior to the finalization of agreements with our
development services customers as reaching a final agreement and
revenue recognition is not assured. Development services costs
incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in
cost of revenues.

Advertising and
Promotion Costs

Advertising and
sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years
ended December 31, 2013, 2012 and 2011, advertising, promotion
and related marketing expenses were $9.0 million, $3.9 million and
$2.9 million, respectively.

Shipping and Handling
Costs

Amounts billed
to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as
revenue, and related shipping and handling costs are included in
cost of revenues.

Income
Taxes

Income taxes
are computed using the asset and liability method, under which
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized.

We record
liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe
that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be
fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified
as income tax expense.

Stock-based
Compensation

We recognize
compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and our
employee stock purchase plan (the ESPP). The fair value of stock
options and the ESPP are estimated on the grant date and offering
date using an option pricing model, respectively. The fair value of
RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market
value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is
recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period, net of estimated forfeitures.

We account for
equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair value
of the awards. The fair value of the awards granted to
non-employees is re-measured as the awards vest and the resulting
change in fair value, if any, is recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations during the period the related services are
rendered.

For
performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is
recognized over the expected performance achievement period of
individual performance milestones when the achievement of each
individual performance milestone becomes probable.

For
performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on
the attainment of both performance and market conditions, the
stock-based compensation expense is recognized for each pair of
performance and market conditions over the longer of the expected
achievement period of the performance and market conditions,
beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance
condition is considered probable of being met (see Note
8).

Foreign Currency
Remeasurement and Transactions

For each of our
foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency is the U. S. Dollar.
For these foreign subsidiaries, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in non-U. S. currencies are re-measured to U. S. Dollars
using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-U. S.
currencies are maintained at historical U. S.  Dollar exchange
rates. Revenues and expenses are re-measured at average
U. S.  Dollar monthly rates.

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses
are recognized in other income (expense), net, in the consolidated
statements of operations. For the year ended December 31,
2013, we recorded foreign currency transaction gains of $11.9
million. For the years ended December 2012 and 2011, foreign
currency transaction gains and losses were not
significant.

Comprehensive
Loss

Comprehensive
loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income
(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized
gains and losses on our available-for-sale marketable securities
that have been excluded from the determination of net
loss.

Warranties

We provide a
warranty on all vehicle, production powertrain components and
systems sales, and we accrue warranty reserves at the time a
vehicle or production powertrain component or system is delivered
to the customer. Warranty reserves include management’s best
estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items
under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes
available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of
historical data. For new vehicles, warranty reserves are based on
management’s best estimate of projected warranty experience
until adequate historical data is accumulated. Our warranty
reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with
our resale value guarantee vehicles as such actual warranty costs
are expensed as incurred. For the year ended December 31,
2013, warranty costs incurred for our resale value guarantee
vehicles was $1.6 million. We may have material changes as we
accumulate more actual data and experience. We review our reserves
at least quarterly to ensure that our accruals are adequate in
meeting expected future warranty obligations, and we will adjust
our estimates as needed. Warranty expense is recorded as a
component of cost of revenues in the consolidated statements of
operations. The portion of the warranty provision which is expected
to be incurred within 12 months from the balance sheet date is
classified as current, while the remaining amount is classified as
long-term.

We began
recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster
sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a warranty
of three years or 36,000 miles, which we extended to four years or
50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Tesla
Roadster customers had the opportunity to purchase an Extended
Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional
three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a
specified period of time.

In June 2012,
we commenced deliveries of Model S. For our Model S customers, we
provide a four year or 50,000 miles New Vehicle Limited Warranty,
subject to separate limited warranties for the supplemental
restraint system and battery. The New Vehicle Limited Warranty also
covers the battery for a period of eight years or 125,000 miles or
unlimited miles, depending on the size of the vehicle’s
battery, although the battery’s charging capacity is not
covered. Model S customers also have the opportunity to purchase an
Extended Service plan for the period after the end of the New
Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an
additional four years or 50,000 miles, provided they are purchased
within a specified period of time. The battery pack’s
charging capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited
Warranty or any Extended Service plan. Accrued warranty activity
consisted of the following for the periods presented (in
thousands):

Environmental
Liabilities

We are subject
to federal and state laws and regulations for the protection of the
environment, including those related to the discharge of hazardous
materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In October 2010,
we completed the purchase of our Tesla Factory located in Fremont,
California from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI
has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont
site which could affect soil and groundwater. As the owner of the
Fremont site, we may be responsible for the entire investigation
and remediation of any environmental contamination at the Fremont
site, whether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the
property. Upon the completion of the purchase in October 2010, we
recorded the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we
estimated to be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities
was determined based on an expected value analysis of the related
potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various
environmental conditions that were identified as part of
NUMMI’s facility decommissioning activities as well as our
own diligence efforts. Estimated potential costs are not discounted
to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably
estimated. We assess adequacy of our accrued environmental
liabilities for investigation and remediation of any environmental
contamination at least quarterly and adjust our estimates as
appropriate. As of December 31, 2013 and 2012, we accrued a
total of $5.5 million and $5.3 million related to these
environmental liabilities, respectively (see Note 12).

Net Loss per Share of
Common Stock

Our basic and
diluted net loss per share of common stock is calculated by
dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock
outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are
based on the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options
and warrants as well as our Notes, are not included when their
effect is antidilutive.

The following
table presents the potential weighted common shares outstanding
that were excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net
loss per share of common stock for the periods, related to the
following securities:

Since we will
settle the principal amount of our 1.50% convertible senior notes
(see Note 6) in cash, we use the treasury stock method for
calculating any potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread
on diluted net income per share, if applicable. The conversion
spread will have a dilutive impact on diluted net income per share
of common stock when the average market price of our common stock
for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $124.52 per
share.
