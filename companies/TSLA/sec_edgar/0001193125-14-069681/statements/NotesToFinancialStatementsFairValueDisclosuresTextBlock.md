| **  Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | 4. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The carrying
values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a
basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and
liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which
prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
(Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active
markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
(Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no
market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This
hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when
available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
determining fair value. Our financial assets that are measured at
fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and
marketable securities. Our liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis have consisted historically of our
common stock warrant liability.

All of our cash
equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised
primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of
the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted
market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our common
stock warrant liability (see Note 6) was classified within Level
III of the fair value hierarchy.

As of
December 31, 2013 and 2012, the fair value hierarchy for our
financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair
value was as follows (in thousands):

The estimated
fair value of our Notes based on a market approach was
approximately $914.9 million (par value of $660.0 million) as of
December 31, 2013, and represents a Level II
valuation.  The estimated fair value of our DOE loans based on
a market approach was approximately $366.9 million (par value of
$452.3 million) as of December 31, 2012, and represented Level
II valuations. When determining the estimated fair value of our
long-term debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology
and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable,
such as credit risk.
