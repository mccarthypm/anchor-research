Daimler AG

Daimler
Mercedes-Benz EV Program

During the
fourth quarter of 2011, Daimler engaged us to assist with the
development of a full electric powertrain for a Daimler
Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV vehicle. In 2012, we received two purchase
orders from Daimler to begin development work and also entered into
a separate development agreement. Pursuant to the development
agreement, Daimler would pay us up to $33.2 million for the
successful completion of certain at risk development milestones and
the delivery of prototype samples. During the years ended
December 31, 2013 and 2012, we completed various milestones
and delivered prototype samples and recognized $15.6 million and
$15.9 million in development services revenue,
respectively.

Toyota Motor
Corporation

Toyota
RAV4 Program

In July 2010, we
and Toyota entered into a Phase 0 agreement to initiate development
of an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. Under this early
phase development agreement, prototypes were made by us by
combining the Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric
powertrain.

During the year
ended December 31, 2011, we recognized $7.6 million in
development services revenue. As of December 31, 2011, we had
delivered all prototypes; therefore, no additional Phase 0 revenue
was recognized during the years ended December 31, 2013 and
2012.

In October 2010,
we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota
for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a
battery pack, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and
associated software to be integrated into an electric vehicle
version of the Toyota RAV4. Toyota paid $60.1 million for the
successful completion of certain at risk development milestones and
the delivery of prototype samples, including a $5.0 million upfront
payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011, we
completed various milestones and along with the amortization of our
upfront payment and the delivery of certain prototype samples, we
recognized $10.7 million and $47.4 million in development services
revenue, respectively. As of March 31, 2012, all development
milestones under the Phase 1 agreement had been completed;
therefore, no additional revenue was recognized during the year
ended December 31, 2013.

In
July 2011, we entered into a supply and services agreement
with Toyota for the supply of a validated electric powertrain
system, including a battery pack, charging system, inverter, motor,
gearbox and associated software, which will be integrated into an
electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Additionally, we will
provide Toyota with certain services related to the supply of the
electric powertrain system. During the three months ended
March 31, 2012, we began delivering electric powertrain
systems to Toyota. During the years ended December 31, 2013
and 2012, we recognized revenue of $42.9 million and $29.1 million
in automotive sales related to these sales, respectively. Our
production activities under this program are expected to continue
through 2014.
