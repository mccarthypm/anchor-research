|   Use of Estimates | Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities and accompanying notes. 
Estimates are used for, but not limited to, determining the selling price of 
products and services in multiple element revenue arrangements and determining 
the amortization period of these elements, residual value of operating lease 
vehicles, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of financial instruments, 
depreciable lives of property and equipment, inputs used to value stock-based 
compensation including volatility, lives of stock option awards and forfeiture 
rates, income taxes, and contingencies. Actual results could differ from those 
estimates.

| **  Recent Accounting Pronouncements** | Recent Accounting Pronouncements

In May 2014, the Financial Accounting Standards Board issued an accounting 
update which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue recognition. 
The new guidance provides a new model to determine when and over what period 
revenue is recognized. Under this new model, revenue is recognized as goods or 
services are delivered in an amount that reflects the consideration we expect to
collect. The guidance is effective for fiscal years beginning after December 15,
2017; early adoption is permitted for periods beginning after December 15, 2016.
The new standard is required to either be applied retrospectively to each prior 
reporting period presented or retrospectively with the cumulative effect of 
initially applying it recognized at the date of initial application. We have not
yet selected a transition method and are evaluating the impact of adopting it.

In April 2015, the FASB issued new authoritative accounting guidance on 
simplifying the presentation of debt issuance costs, which requires that debt 
issuance costs related to a recognized debt liability be presented in the 
balance sheet as a direct deduction from the carrying amount of that debt 
liability, consistent with debt discounts. We did not adopt this standard during
2015; however, the impact to the our Consolidated Balance Sheet as of December 
31, 2015 would have been a $10.7 million reduction in prepaid expenses and other
current assets, a $18.7 million reduction in other assets, and a corresponding 
reduction in the aggregate carrying value of the Company’s long term debt 
liabilities.

In November 2015, the FASB issued Accounting Standards Update No. 2015-17, 
Income Taxes (Topic 740): Balance Sheet Classification of Deferred Taxes (ASU 
2015-17), which simplifies the presentation of deferred income taxes by 
requiring that deferred tax assets and liabilities be classified as non-current.
We have retrospectively adopted this standard as of December 31, 2015, and as a 
result we reclassified $18.6 million of current deferred tax assets to 
non-current and netted $18.6 million non-current deferred tax liabilities 
against our non-current deferred tax assets as of December 31, 2014.

| **  Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

We recognize revenue for products and services when: (i) a persuasive evidence 
of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred and there are no 
uncertainties regarding customer acceptance; (iii) pricing or fees are fixed or 
determinable; and (iv) collection is reasonably assured.

Vehicle sales include standard features, customer selected options and 
accessories, and specific other elements that meet the definition of a 
deliverable under multiple-element accounting guidance including free internet 
connectivity, free access to our Supercharger network, and future over the air 
software updates. These deliverables are valued on a stand-alone basis and we 
recognize their revenue over our performance period, which is generally the 
eight-year life of the vehicle, except for internet connectivity which is over 
the free four year period. If we sell a deliverable separately, we use that 
pricing to determine its fair value; otherwise, we use our best estimated 
selling price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, 
third party pricing of similar options, and other information which may be 
available.

At the time of revenue recognition, we record a reserve against revenue for 
estimated future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical 
experience and are immaterial in all periods presented.

Vehicle sales to customers with a residual value guarantee

We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to all customers who 
purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicle through one of our specified 
commercial banking partners. Under this program, customers have the option of 
selling their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period for a 
pre-determined resale value. Guarantee periods generally range from 36 to 39 
months. Although we receive full payment for the vehicle sales price at the time
of delivery, we are required to account for these transactions as operating 
leases. The amount of sale proceeds equal to the residual value guarantee is 
deferred until the guarantee expires or is exercised. The remaining sale 
proceeds are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the stated 
guarantee period. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the 
guarantee period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of 
these vehicles to leased vehicles on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and 
depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive revenue over 
the same period.

In cases when customer retains ownership of the vehicle at the end of the 
guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining 
deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive 
revenue and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to costs of 
automotive revenue. In cases when customers return the vehicle back to us during
the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle form the customer in an amount 
equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred balances 
to automotive revenue and we reclassify the net book value of the vehicle on our
balance sheet to pre-owned vehicle inventory. As of December 31, 2015, $136.8 
million of guarantees are exercisable by customers within the next twelve 
months.

Vehicle sales to leasing partners with a residual value guarantee

In the fourth quarter of 2014, we also began offering residual value guarantees 
in connection with automobile sales to certain bank leasing partners. As we have
guaranteed the value of these vehicles and as the vehicles are leased to 
end-customers, we account for these transactions as interest bearing 
collateralized borrowings as required underASC 840 - Leases. Under this program,
cash is received for the full price of the vehicle and is recorded within resale
value guarantee for the long-term portion and deferred revenue for the current 
portion. We accrete the deferred revenue amount to automotive revenue on a 
straight line basis over the guarantee period and accrue interest expense based 
on our borrowing rate. We capitalize vehicles under this program to leased 
vehicles on our Consolidated Balance Sheets and we record depreciation from 
these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues during the period the vehicle is 
under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these vehicles, net of revenue 
recognized during the period, is classified as collateralized lease borrowings 
within cash flows from financing activities in our Consolidated Statements of 
Cash Flows.

At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either 
purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the residual value guarantee
amount, or paying a shortfall to the guarantee amount the leasing partner may 
realize on the sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred 
revenue and resale value guarantee will be settled to automotive revenue. In 
cases where the bank retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our 
guarantee period, we expense the net value of the leased vehicle to costs of 
automotive revenue. The maximum cash we could be required to pay under this 
program, should we decide to repurchase all vehicles is $348.2 million at 
December 31, 2015.

As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had $527.5 million and $16.7 
million of such borrowings recorded in the resale value guarantee liability and 
$120.5 million and $3.9 million recorded in deferred revenue liability.

At least annually, we assess the estimated market values of vehicles under our 
resale value guarantee program to determine if we have sustained a loss on any 
of these contracts. As we accumulate more data related to the resale values of 
our vehicles or as market conditions change, there may be significant changes to
their estimated values.

following for the period presented (in thousands):

Direct Vehicle Leasing Program

In April 2014, we began offering a leasing program in the United States, and 
subsequently began to offer similar programs in Canada and Germany. Qualifying 
customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from a local Tesla 
subsidiary for 36 or 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers have the
option of either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a 
pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing transactions as 
operating leases and recognize leasing revenues over the contractual term and 
record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive revenues. As of 
December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, we had deferred $25.8 million and $9.4 
million of lease-related upfront payments which will be recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the contractual term of the individual leases. Lease 
revenues are recorded in automotive revenue and for the year ended December 31, 
2015 and December 31, 2014, we recognized $41.2 million and $4.4 million.

Regulatory Credits

California and certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle 
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered for sale in 
that state during each model year are zero emission vehicles. These laws and 
regulations provide that a manufacturer of zero emission vehicles may earn 
regulatory credits (ZEV credits) and may sell excess credits to other 
manufacturers who apply such credits to comply with these regulatory 
requirements. Similar regulations exist at the federal level that require 
compliance related to greenhouse gas emissions and also allow for the sale of 
excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a manufacturer 
solely of zero emission vehicles, we have earned emission credits, such as ZEV 
and GHG credits on vehicles, and we expect to continue to earn these credits in 
the future. We enter into contractual agreements with third parties to purchase 
our regulatory credits.

We recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal title to the
credits is transferred to the purchasing party. Revenue from the sale of 
regulatory credits totaled $168.7 million, $216.3 million, and $194.4 million 
for the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013.

Additionally we have entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey
County in Nevada that will provide abatements for sales and use taxes, real and 
personal property taxes, and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff
energy rates, and transferable tax credits. These incentives will be available 
for the applicable periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on June 30, 
2034, subject to capital investments by Tesla and its partners for the 
Gigafactory of at least $3.5 billion in the aggregate on or before June 30, 
2024, and certain other conditions specified in the agreements. If we do not 
satisfy one or more conditions under the agreement, Tesla will be required to 
repay to the respective taxing authorities the amounts of the tax incentives 
incurred, plus interest. As of December 31, 2015, we have earned $19.9 million 
of transferable tax credits under these agreements. We record these credits as 
earned when we have evidence there is a market for their sale. Credits are 
applied as a cost offset to either employee expense or to capital assets, 
depending on the source of the credits. Credits earned from employee hires or 
capital spending by our partners at the Gigafactory are recorded to other income
(expense), net.

Maintenance and Service Plans

We offer a prepaid maintenance program for Model S, which includes plans 
covering maintenance for up to eight years or up to 100,000 miles, provided 
these services are purchased within a specified period of time. The maintenance 
plans cover annual inspections and the replacement of wear and tear parts, 
excluding tires and the battery. Payments collected in advance of the 
performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the 
consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales as we fulfill our
performance obligations.

We also offer an extended service plan, which covers the repair or replacement 
of Model S parts for an additional four years or up to an additional 50,000 
miles, after the end of our initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty, provided they 
are purchased within a specified period of time. Payments collected in advance 
of the performance of service are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the
consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales ratably over the 
service coverage periods.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we had deferred $53.6 million and $39.7 
million related to our maintenance and service plans. During the years ended 
December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recognized revenue of $4.5 million and $3.0 
million related to these plans.
 |  |  |
| **  Cash and Cash Equivalents** | Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents. We currently 
invest our cash primarily in money market funds.
 |  |  |
|   Marketable Securities | Marketable Securities

Marketable securities are comprised of commercial paper and corporate debt and 
are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated fair value, 
with unrealized gains and losses recorded in accumulated other comprehensive 
loss which is included within stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on
the sale of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other 
income (expense), net. The cost of available-for-sale marketable securities sold
is based on the specific identification method. Interest, dividends, 
amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and discounts on our marketable 
securities are included in other income (expense), net. Available-for-sale 
marketable securities with maturities greater than three months at the date of 
purchase and remaining maturities of one year or less are classified as 
short-term marketable securities. Where temporary declines in fair value exist, 
we have the ability and the intent to hold these securities for a period of time
sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.

When held, we regularly review all of our marketable securities for 
other-than-temporary declines in fair value. The review includes but is not 
limited to (i) the consideration of the cause of the impairment, (ii) the 
creditworthiness of the security issuers, (iii) the length of time a security is
in an unrealized loss position, and (iv) our ability to hold the security for a 
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in fair value.
 |  |  |
|   Restricted Cash and Deposits | Restricted Cash and Deposits

We maintain certain cash amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. Current and
noncurrent restricted cash as of December 31, 2015 was comprised primarily of 
cash as collateral related to our sales to lease partners with a residual value 
guarantee and for letters of credit including for our real estate leases, and 
insurance policies. In December 2015, we settled and closed our Warehouse 
Facility and removed restrictions on cash related to that arrangement.
 |  |  |
| **  Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts** | Accounts Receivable and Allowance for DoubtfulAccounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain 
systems, receivables from financial institutions and leasing companies offering 
various financing products to our customers, regulatory credits to other 
automotive manufacturers, and from maintenance services on vehicles owned by 
leasing companies. We provide an allowance against amounts receivable to the 
amount we reasonably believe will be collected.

We typically do not carry accounts receivable related to our vehicle and related
sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery, except for the 
amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing 
arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions.
 |  |  |
|   Concentration of Risk | Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash and accounts receivable.
Our cash equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high 
credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At times, these 
deposits and securities may be in excess of insured limits. We invest cash not 
required for use in operations in high credit quality securities based on our 
investment policy. Our investment policy provides guidelines and limits 
regarding credit quality, investment concentration, investment type, and 
maturity that we believe will provide liquidity while reducing risk of loss of 
capital. Our investments are currently of a short-term nature and include 
commercial paper and U. S. treasury bills.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, our accounts receivable were derived primarily
from sales of regulatory credits, as well as funds to be received from financial
institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products to our 
customers, the development and sales of powertrain components and systems to 
OEMs. Accounts receivable also included amounts to be received from commercial 
financial institutions for approved financing arrangements between our customers
and financial institutions.

The following summarizes the accounts receivable from our customers in excess of
10% of our total accounts receivable:

                  December 31,              December 31,          
                          2015                      2014

  Customer B                         8                        14  
  Customer C                         6                        13  
  Customer D                         —                        19  

Supply Risk

Although there may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used 
in our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these single source
suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a timely basis at competitive 
prices, we could suffer manufacturing delays, a possible loss of revenues, or 
incur higher cost of sales, any of which could adversely affect our operating 
results.
 |  |  |
| **  Inventories and Inventory Valuation** | Inventories and Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using 
standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. We
record inventory write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based on current
and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on hand is in excess of our future
demand forecast, the excess amounts are written off.

We also review inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the net
amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us to 
determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost to
convert inventory on hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A
small change in our estimates may result in a material change to our reported 
financial results.
 |  |  |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated 
depreciation. Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method 
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as follows:

  Machinery, equipment and office furniture      3 to 12 years  
  Building and building improvements             30 years       
  Computer equipment and software                3 years        

Depreciation for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method 
whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated productive life
of the related assets. As of December 31, 2015, the estimated productive life 
for tooling was 250,000 vehicles based on our current estimates of production.

Leasehold improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the shorter 
of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related lease.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
related accumulated depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the 
resulting gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repair 
expenditures are expensed as incurred, while major improvements that increase 
the functionality, output or expected life of the asset are capitalized and 
depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life. Land is not 
depreciated.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on construction in 
progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is amortized over the
life of the related assets.
 |  |  |
| **  Operating Lease Vehicles** | Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles delivered under our resale value guarantee program, vehicles that are 
leased as part of our leasing programs as well as any vehicles that are sold 
with a significant buy-back guarantee are classified as operating lease vehicles
as the related revenue transactions are treated as operating leases. Operating 
lease vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation 
is computed using the straight-line method over the expected operating lease 
term. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets as of December 31, 2015 and 2014 was $2.0 billion and $849.8 
million. Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31, 
2015 and 2014 was $216.5 million and $83.1 million.
 |  |  |
| **  Long-lived Assets** | Long-lived Assets

We evaluate our long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for indicators 
of possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be recoverable. Impairment 
exists if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the estimates of future net
undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by such assets. Should 
impairment exist, the impairment loss would be measured based on the excess 
carrying value of the asset over the asset’s estimated fair value. We did not 
record any material impairment losses on our long-lived assets in 2015 and 2014.
 |  |  |
|   Research and Development Costs | Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and 
development expenses consist primarily of payroll, benefits and stock-based 
compensation of those employees engaged in research, design and development 
activities, costs related to design tools, license expenses related to 
intellectual property, supplies and services, depreciation and other occupancy 
costs.
 |  |  |
| **  Marketing and Promotion Costs** | Marketing and Promotion Costs

Marketing and sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years 
ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, advertising, promotion and related 
marketing expenses were $58.3 million, $48.9 million and $9.0 million.

| **  Transportation Costs** | Transportation Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as 
automotive revenue, and related transportation costs are included in cost of 
automotive revenues.
 |  |  |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.
 |  |  |
|   Stock-Based Compensation | Stock-based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (RSUs) and our employee stock 
purchase plan (the ESPP). The fair value of stock options and the ESPP are 
estimated on the grant date and offering date using an option pricing model, 
respectively. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the 
closing fair market value of our common stock. Stock-based compensation expense 
is recognized on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period, net of
estimated forfeitures.

We account for equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair 
value of the awards. The fair value of the awards granted to non-employees is 
re-measured as the awards vest and the resulting change in fair value, if any, 
is recognized in the consolidated statements of operations during the period the
related services are rendered.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable.

For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of both performance and market conditions, the stock-based 
compensation expense is recognized for each pair of performance and market 
conditions over the longer of the expected achievement period of the performance
and market conditions, beginning at the point in time that the relevant 
performance condition is considered probable of being met (see Note 10 - Equity 
Incentive Plans).

| **  Foreign Currency** | Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the US dollar,
we will recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the different 
rates we apply to retained earnings, including current period income or loss, 
and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply a monthly average 
functional currency rate to their income or loss and the month end functional 
currency rate to translate the balance sheet.

Beginning January 1, 2015, the functional currency of each of our foreign 
subsidiaries changed to their local country’s currency. This change was based on
the culmination of facts and circumstances that have developed as we expanded 
our foreign operations over the past year. The adjustment of $10.0 million 
attributable to the current rate translation of non-monetary assets as of the 
date of the change is included in accumulated other comprehensive loss on our 
consolidated balance sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the year ended
December 31, 2015, 2014, and 2013 we recorded foreign currency transaction gains
(loss) of ($45.6) million, $2.0 million and $11.9 million.

| **  Derivative Financial Instruments** | Derivative Financial Instruments

In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency 
exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in 
Japanese yen. The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward 
contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 
months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or 
speculative purposes (See Note 3 -Financial Instruments).

The bank counterparties in all contracts expose Tesla to credit-related losses 
in the event of their nonperformance. However, to mitigate that risk, Tesla only
contracts with counterparties who meet the Company’s minimum requirements under 
its counterparty risk assessment process. Tesla monitors ratings, credit 
spreads, and potential downgrades on at least a quarterly basis. Based on our 
on-going assessment of counterparty risk, the Company will adjust its exposure 
to various counterparties. We generally enter into master netting arrangements, 
which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the 
same counterparty. However, we do not have any master netting arrangements in 
place with collateral features.
 |  |  |
| **  Comprehensive Loss** | Comprehensive Loss

Comprehensive loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive income 
(loss). Other comprehensive income (loss) consists of unrealized gains and 
losses on derivatives, our available-for-sale marketable securities, and foreign
currency translation adjustment that have been excluded from the determination 
of net loss.
 |  |  |
|   Warranties | Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all vehicles, production powertrain 
components and systems, and Tesla Energy products we sell. We accrue a 
manufacturer’s warranty reserve which includes our best estimate of the 
projected costs to repair or to replace items under warranty. These estimates 
are based on actual claims incurred to-date and an estimate of the nature, 
frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates are inherently uncertain 
and changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause 
material changes to our warranty reserve in the future. The portion of the 
warranty provision expected to be incurred within 12 months is classified as 
current within accrued liabilities, while the remaining amount is classified as 
long-term within other long-term liabilities.

Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following for the periods presented 
(in thousands):

Our warranty reserves do not include projected warranty costs associated with 
our vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt 
arrangements. Costs to repair these vehicles are expensed as incurred. For the 
twelve months ended December 31, 2015, and December 31, 2014 warranty costs 
incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases or collateralized debt 
arrangements were $9.5 million and $7.1 million. Warranty expense is recorded as
a component of cost of automotive revenue.

| **  Net Loss per Share of Common Stock** | Net Loss per Share of Common Stock

Our basic and diluted net loss per share of common stock is calculated by 
dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for
the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the number of shares
underlying outstanding stock options and warrants as well as our Notes, are not 
included when their effect is antidilutive.

The following table presents the potential weighted common shares outstanding 
that were excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per share 
of common stock for the periods, related to the following securities:

                                   Year Ended December 31,

—                 1,061,439  

Since we expect to settle the principal amount of our outstanding convertible 
senior notes in cash, we use the treasury stock method for calculating any 
potential dilutive effect of the conversion spread on diluted net income per 
share, if applicable. The conversion spread will have a dilutive impact on 
diluted net income per share of common stock when the average market price of 
our common stock for a given period exceeds the conversion price of $124.52, 
$359.87, and $359.87 per share for the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes.
