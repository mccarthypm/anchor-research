| **  Customer Deposits** | Note 7 - Customer Deposits

Customer deposits include cash payments from customers at the time they place an
order for a vehicle and additional payments up to the point of delivery 
including the fair value of customer trade-in vehicles that are applicable 
toward a new vehicle purchase. Customer deposit amounts and timing vary 
depending on the vehicle model and country of delivery. Customer deposits are 
fully refundable up to the point the vehicle is placed into the production 
cycle. Customer deposits are included in current liabilities until refunded or 
until they are applied to a customer’s purchase balance at time of delivery.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we held $283.4 million and $257.6 million in 
customer deposits.
