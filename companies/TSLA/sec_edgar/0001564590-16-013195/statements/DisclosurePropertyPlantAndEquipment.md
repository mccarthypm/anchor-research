Construction in progress is comprised primarily of tooling and equipment related
to the manufacturing of our Model S and Model X vehicles, Gigafactory 
construction, and related capitalized interest. Completed assets are transferred
to their respective asset class and depreciation begins when the asset is ready 
for its intended use. Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during
the period of significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on 
construction in progress is included in property, plant and equipment, and is 
amortized over the life of the related assets. During the years ended December 
31, 2015 and 2014, we capitalized $41.5 million and $12.8 million of interest 
expense.

We are sometimes involved in construction at our leased facilities primarily 
related to retail stores, service centers, and certain manufacturing facilities.
In accordance with Accounting Standards Codification 840, Leases, for 
build-to-suit lease arrangements where we are involved in the construction of 
structural improvements prior to the commencement of the lease or take some 
level of construction risk, we are considered the owner of the assets and land 
during the construction period. Accordingly, upon commencement of our 
construction activities, we record a construction in progress asset and a 
corresponding financing liability. Once the construction is completed, if the 
lease meets certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we will remove the asset and 
related financial obligation from the balance sheet and treat the building lease
as an operating lease. If upon completion of construction, the project does not 
meet the “sale-leaseback” criteria, the leased property will be treated as a 
capital lease and included in building and building improvements in the table 
above. As of December 31, 2015 and December 31, 2014, the table above includes 
$206.1 million and $52.4 million of build-to-suit assets. As of December 31, 
2015 and December 31, 2014, corresponding financing obligations of $1.3 million 
and $21.0 million are recorded in accrued liabilities and $201.3 million and 
$31.4 million are recorded in other long-term liabilities.

Depreciation and amortization expense during the years ended December 31, 2015, 
2014 and 2013 were $278.7 million, $155.9 million and $83.9 million. Total 
property and equipment assets under capital lease as of December 31, 2015 and 
2014 were $58.1 million and $33.4 million. Accumulated depreciation related to 
assets under capital lease as of these dates were $22.7 million and $12.8 
million.

We have acquired land for the site of our Gigafactory and construction 
activities are ongoing for which we have incurred $317.5 million and $106.6 
million of costs as of December 31, 2015 and 2014.
