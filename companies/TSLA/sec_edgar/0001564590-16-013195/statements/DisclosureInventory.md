Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill customer 
orders, new vehicles available for immediate sale at our retail and service 
center locations, and pre-owned Tesla vehicles. The increase in finished goods 
inventory was primarily due to customer orders that were in transit for delivery
at year end.

We write down inventory as a result of excess and obsolete inventories, or when 
we believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the 
carrying value. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013, we 
recorded write-downs of $44.9 million, $15.6 million and $8.9 million in cost of
automotive sales.
