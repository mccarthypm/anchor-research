Fair Value Measurements

The carrying values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents, 
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable approximate 
their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a basis for determining the 
fair value of certain of our assets and liabilities, we established a three-tier
fair value hierarchy which prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value 
as follows: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active markets;
(Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active markets that are 
observable either directly or indirectly; and (Level III) unobservable inputs in
which there is little or no market data which requires us to develop our own 
assumptions. This hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when 
available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when determining fair 
value. Our financial assets that are measured at fair value on a recurring basis
consist of cash equivalents and marketable securities.

All of our cash equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised 
primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of the fair value
hierarchy because they are valued using quoted market prices or market prices 
for similar securities. Our restricted short-term marketable securities are 
classified within Level I of the fair value hierarchy.

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, the fair value hierarchy for our financial 
assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair value was as follows 
(in thousands), and unrealized gains (losses) on financial assets presented in 
the table below for all periods presented were less than $1.0 million:

As of December 31, 2015, the estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes,
and 2021 Notes was $1.29 billion (par value $659.8 million), $864.8 million (par
value $920.0 million), and $1.27 billion (par value $1.38 billion). As of 
December 31, 2014 the estimated fair value of our 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 
2021 Notes was $1.22 billion (par value $659.8 million), $852.2 million (par 
value $920.0 million), and $1.25 billion (par value $1.38 billion). These fair 
values represent Level II valuations. When determining the estimated fair value 
of our long-term debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology and 
market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit 
risk. As of December 31, 2015, the $135.0 million carrying value of our Credit 
Agreement liability approximates the fair value of the borrowings based upon the
borrowing rate available to us for debt with similar terms and consideration of 
credit and default risk using Level II inputs.

Derivative Financial Instruments

In November 2015, we implemented a program to hedge the foreign currency 
exposure risk related to certain forecasted inventory purchases denominated in 
Japanese yen. The derivative instruments we use are foreign currency forward 
contracts and are designated as cash flow hedges with maturity dates of 12 
months or less. We do not enter into derivative contracts for trading or 
speculative purposes.

We document each hedge relationship and assess its initial effectiveness at the 
inception of the hedge contract and we measure its ongoing effectiveness on a 
quarterly basis using regression analysis. During the term of an effective hedge
contract, we record gains and losses within accumulated other comprehensive 
loss. We reclassify these gains or losses to costs of automotive sales in the 
period the related finished goods inventory is sold or over the depreciation 
period for those sales accounted for as leases. Although our contracts are 
considered effective hedges, we may experience small amounts of ineffectiveness 
due to timing differences between our actual inventory purchases and the 
settlement date of the related foreign currency forward contracts. We have 
recorded zero amount of ineffectiveness within other income (expense), net in 
our Consolidated Statements of Operations, as of December 31, 2015.

The net notional amount of these contracts was $322.6 million at December 31, 
2015. Outstanding contracts are recognized as either assets or liabilities on 
the Consolidated Balance Sheet at fair value within other assets or within 
accrued liabilities, depending on our net position. The net gain of $7.3 million
in accumulated other comprehensive loss as of December 31, 2015 is expected to 
be recognized to the cost basis of finished goods inventory in the next twelve 
months. The total fair values of foreign currency contracts designated as cash 
flow hedges as of December 31, 2015 is $7.3 million and was determined using 
Level II inputs and recorded in prepaid expenses and other current assets on our
Consolidated Balance Sheets. No amounts have been reclassified to finished goods
inventory as of December 31, 2015.
