| **  Schedule of Debt Discounts** | In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the Notes from the 
respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option for
the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes in stockholders’ equity. The 
resulting debt discounts on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes are being
amortized to interest expense at the effective interest rate over the 
contractual terms of the Notes.
