As of December 31, 2015, we recorded a valuation allowance of $668.4 million for
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation on our net deferred taxes increased by $144.0 million during the year 
ended December 31, 2015, primarily due to additional U. S. deferred tax assets 
incurred in the current year that cannot be realized. Management believes that 
based on the available information, it is more likely than not that the U. S. 
deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a full valuation allowance 
is required against all U. S. deferred tax assets. The Company has net $3.3 
million of deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions which it believes are 
more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future 
earnings in these jurisdictions.

As of December 31, 2015, we had approximately $2.14 billion of federal and $1.36
billion of state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future 
taxable income, which will begin to expire for federal in 2024 and 2019 for 
state purposes. The portion of net operating loss carryforwards related to stock
options is approximately $867.2 million and $379.8 million for federal and state
purposes, respectively, of which the tax benefits will be credited to additional
paid-in capital when realized. We have research and development tax credits of 
approximately $58.6 million and $62.0 million for federal and state income tax 
purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal carry-forwards will expire 
in various amounts beginning in 2019. However, the state research and 
development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we 
have other general business tax credits of approximately $29.9 million for 
federal income tax purposes, which will begin to expire in 2034.

No deferred tax liability has been recognized for the remittance of any 
undistributed foreign earnings to the United States since the Company has no 
material amount of undistributed foreign earnings outside of our U. S. tax 
jurisdiction as of December 31, 2015.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We determined 
that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of our net 
operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to any prior ownership changes.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits 
during the years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 were as follows (in 
thousands):

  December 31, 2012                                                18,070  
  Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions        (7,802  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax positions       3,102  
  December 31, 2013                                                13,370  
  Increase in balances related to prior year tax positions             56  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax positions      27,951  
  December 31, 2014                                                41,377  
  Increase in balances related to prior year tax positions          6,626  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax positions      51,124  
  December 31, 2015                                                99,127  

Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are 
classified as income tax expense and was immaterial. As of December 31, 2015, 
unrecognized tax benefits of $95.7 million, if recognized, would not affect our 
effective tax rate as the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which
is currently fully offset with a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate 
that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly 
increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We file income tax returns in 
the United States, California, and other states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax 
years 2003 to 2014 remain subject to examination for federal purposes, and tax 
years 2003 to 2014 remain subject to examination for California purposes. All 
net operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment
for U. S. federal and California purposes. Tax years 2007 to 2014 remain open 
for examination in other U. S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

The United States Tax Court has issued a decision in Altera Corp v. Commissioner
related to the treatment of share-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing 
arrangement. As this decision can be overturned upon appeal, we have not 
recorded any impact as of December 31, 2015. In addition, any potential tax 
benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently offset with a 
full valuation allowance.
