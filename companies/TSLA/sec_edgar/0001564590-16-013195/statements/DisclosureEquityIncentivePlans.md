| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 10 - Equity Incentive Plans

In July 2003, we adopted the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the 
effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on June 28, 2010, we 
adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan) and all remaining common 
shares reserved for future grant or issuance under the 2003 Equity Incentive 
Plan were added to the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the 
granting of stock options, RSUs and stock purchase rights to our employees, 
directors and consultants. Options granted under the Plan may be either 
incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be 
granted only to our employees including officers and directors. Nonqualified 
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and 
consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest over four years and are 
exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten years from 
the date the stock options are granted. Continued vesting typically terminates 
when the employment or consulting relationship ends. As of December 31, 2015, 
22,454,854 shares of common stock were reserved for issuance under the Plan.

The following table summarizes stock option and RSU activity under the Plan:

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i. 
e., the difference between our common stock price and the exercise price, 
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received 
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options. The 
aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2015 and 
2014 was $3.90 billion and $4.00 billion. The intrinsic value of options 
exercisable was $2.98 billion and $2.46 billion, and the intrinsic value of 
options vested and expected to vest was $3.90 billion and $4.00 billion as of 
December 31, 2015 and 2014. The total intrinsic value of options exercised was 
$395.6 million and $446.9 million for the years ended December 31, 2015 and 
2014. The aggregate intrinsic value of RSUs outstanding as of December 31, 2015 
and December 31, 2014 was $585.7 million and $329.2 million.

Fair Value Adoption

We utilize the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation 
expense. Under the fair value method, we estimated the fair value of each option
award and the ESPP on the grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option 
pricing model and the weighted average assumptions noted in the following table.

The risk-free interest rate that we use is based on the United States Treasury 
yield in effect at the time of grant for zero coupon United States Treasury 
notes with maturities approximating each grant’s expected life. Given our 
limited history with employee grants, we use the “simplified” method in 
estimating the expected term for our employee grants. The “simplified” method, 
as permitted by the SEC, is calculated as the average of the time-to-vesting and
the contractual life of the options.

Beginning in 2015 our expected volatility is derived from our implied volatility
on publicly traded options of our common stock and the historical volatility of 
our common stock. Prior to 2015, our expected volatility was derived from our 
implied volatility on publicly traded options of our common stock and the 
historical volatilities of several unrelated public companies within industries 
related to our business, including the automotive OEM, automotive retail, 
automotive parts and battery technology industries, because we had limited 
trading history on our common stock. When making the selections of our peer 
companies within industries related to our business to be used in the volatility
calculation, we also considered the stage of development, size and financial 
leverage of potential comparable companies. Our historical volatility and 
implied volatility are weighted based on certain qualitative factors and 
combined to produce a single volatility factor.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for option awards granted during the 
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $108.28, $94.01 and $40.72 per 
share. The weighted-average grant-date fair value for ESPP granted during the 
years ended December 31, 2015, 2014 and 2013 was $58.77, $74.07 and $19.22 per 
share. The fair value of RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing
fair market value of our common stock.

Performance-Based Stock Options

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in 
the achievement of significant milestones by our company, the Compensation 
Committee of our Board of Directors granted stock options to certain employees 
to purchase an aggregate 1,073,000 shares of our common stock. Each such grant 
consists of four vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of future performance milestones, assuming continued employment and 
service to us through each vesting date.

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
achieving aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 
12-month period;  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
completion of the first Gen III Production Vehicle; and  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the options are scheduled to vest upon 
achievement of annualized gross margin of greater than 30.0% in any three years 

As of December 31, 2015, the following performance milestone were achieved and 
approved by our Board of Directors.

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle  

We begin recording stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable. As of December 31, 2015, we had unrecognized compensation expense of 
$68.7 million for those performance milestones that were not considered probable
of achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2015 and 2014, we recorded 
stock-based compensation expense of $10.4 million and $10.7 million related to 
this grant.

2012 CEO Grant

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock options to our 
CEO (2012 CEO Grant). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of ten vesting tranches with a
vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of both performance conditions
and market conditions, assuming continued employment and service to us through 
each vesting date.

Each of the vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the ten 
pre-determined performance milestones outlined below and an incremental increase
in our market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial market 
capitalization of $3.2 billion measured at the time of the 2012 CEO Grant.

  Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle;  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model 3 Production Vehicle;  

  Gross margin of 30% or more for four consecutive quarters;  
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles;  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 200,000 vehicles; and  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 300,000 vehicles.  

The term of the 2012 CEO Grant is ten years, so any tranches that remain 
unvested at the expiration of the 2012 CEO Grant will be forfeited. In addition,
unvested options will be forfeited if our CEO is no longer in that role, whether
for cause or otherwise.

We measured the fair value of the 2012 CEO Grant using a Monte Carlo simulation 
approach with the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.65%, 
expected term of ten years, expected volatility of 55% and dividend yield of 0%.

Stock-based compensation expense associated with the 2012 CEO Grant is 
recognized for each pair of performance and market conditions over the longer of
the expected achievement period of the performance and market conditions, 
beginning at the point in time that the relevant performance condition is 
considered probable of being met.

As of December 31, 2015, the market conditions for seven vesting tranches and 
the following performance milestones were achieved and approved by our Board of 
Directors, and therefore four of ten tranches of the 2012 CEO Grant were vested 
as of such date:

  Successful completion of the Model X Alpha Prototype  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X Beta Prototype; and  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X Production Vehicle  

  Aggregate vehicle production of 100,000 vehicles  

As of December 31, 2015, the following two performance milestones were 
considered probable of achievement:

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Alpha Prototype; and  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model 3 Beta Prototype  
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────

We begin recording stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable. As of December 31, 2015, we had $1.7 million of total unrecognized 
compensation expense for those performance milestones that were considered 
probable of achievement and will be recognized over a weighted-average period of
0.7 years. As of December 31, 2015, we had unrecognized compensation expense of 
$25.1 million for those performance milestones that were not considered probable
of achievement. For the years ended December 31 2015, 2014, and 2013, we 
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $10.6 million, $25.0 million and 
$14.5 million.

No cash compensation has ever been received by our CEO for his services to the 
company.

periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances.

As of December 31, 2015, we had $518.2 million of total unrecognized 
compensation expense, net, of estimated forfeitures, related to non-performance 
awards that will be recognized over a weighted-average period of 3.4 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Employees are eligible to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up
to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The 
purchase price of the shares on each purchase date is equal to 85% of the lower 
of the fair market value of our common stock on the first and last trading days 
of each six-month offering period. During the years ended December 31, 2015, 
2014 and 2013, 220,571, 163,600 and 518,743 shares were issued under the ESPP 
for $37.5 million, $28.6 million and $13.8 million, respectively. A total of 
3,615,749 shares of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP,
and there were 2,115,851 shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of 
December 31, 2015.
