0.25% and 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions

In March 2014, we issued $800.0 million principal amount of 0.25% convertible 
senior notes due 2019 (2019 Notes) and $1.20 billion principal amount of 1.25% 
convertible senior notes due 2021 (2021 Notes) in a public offering. In April 
2014, we issued an additional $120.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2019 
Notes and $180.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2021 Notes, pursuant to 
the exercise in full of the overallotment options of the underwriters of our 
March 2014 public offering. The total net proceeds from these offerings, after 
deducting transaction costs, were approximately $905.8 million from 2019 Notes 
and $1.36 billion from 2021 Notes. We incurred $14.2 million and $21.4 million 
of debt issuance costs in connection with the 2019 Notes and the 2021 Notes, 
which we initially recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest 
expense using the effective interest method over the contractual terms of these 
notes. The interest rates are fixed at 0.25% and 1.25% per annum and are payable
semi-annually in arrears on March 1 and September 1 of each year, commencing on 
September 1, 2014.

Each $1,000 of principal of these notes will initially be convertible into 
2.7788 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion 
price of approximately $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the 
occurrence of specified events. Holders of these notes may convert their notes 
at their option on or after December 1, 2018 for the 2019 Notes and on or after 
December 1, 2020 for the 2021 Notes. Further, holders of these notes may convert
their notes at their option prior to the respective dates above, only under the 
following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after the 
fiscal quarter ending June 30, 2014, if the last reported sale price of our 
common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during 
the last 30 consecutive trading days of immediately preceding fiscal quarter is 
greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price of the applicable notes on
each applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following 
any five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 
applicable notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of 
our common stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we 
make specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified 
corporate transactions occur. Upon conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or
deliver as applicable, cash, shares of our common stock or a combination of cash
and shares of our common stock, at our election. Upon conversion of the 2021 
Notes, we would pay the holders in cash for the principal amount and, if 
applicable, shares of our common stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in 
lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common stock) based on a daily 
conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, 
holders of these notes may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 
notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of 
the notes, plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific 
corporate events occur prior to the applicable maturity date, we will increase 
the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert their notes in connection
with such a corporate event in certain circumstances. During the fourth quarter 
of 2015, the closing price of our common stock did not meet or exceed 130% of 
the applicable conversion price of our 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes on at least 20 
of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; furthermore, no other 
conditions allowing holders of these notes to convert have been met as of 
December 31, 2015. Therefore, the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes are not convertible 
during the first quarter of 2016 and are classified as long-term debt. Should 
the closing price conditions be met in the first quarter of 2015 or a future 
quarter, the 2019 and/or the 2021 Notes will be convertible at their holders’ 
option during the immediately following quarter. As of December 31, 2015, the 
if-converted value of the 2019 Notes and 2021 Notes did not exceed the principal
value of those notes.

In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the notes from the 
respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option of 
$188.1 million for the 2019 Notes and $369.4 million for the 2021 Notes in 
stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discounts on the 2019 Notes and 2021 
Notes are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 
4.89% and 5.96%, respectively, over the contractual terms of the notes.

In connection with the offering of these notes in March 2014, we entered into 
convertible note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase 
initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of 
approximately 5.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of approximately
$359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was
$524.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the 
warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for 
certain specified events) a total of approximately 2.2 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $512.66 for the 2019 Notes and a total of 
approximately 3.3 million shares of our common stock at a price of $560.64 per 
share for 2021 Notes. We received $338.4 million in cash proceeds from the sale 
of these warrants. Similarly, in connection with the issuance of additional 
notes in April 2014, we entered into convertible note hedge transactions and 
paid an aggregate $78.7 million. In addition, we sold warrants to purchase 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) a total of approximately 
0.3 million shares of our common stock at a strike price of $512.66 per share 
for the warrants relating to 2019 Notes, and a total of approximately 0.5 
million shares of our common stock at a strike price of $560.64 per share for 
the warrants relating to 2021 Notes. We received aggregate proceeds of 
approximately $50.8 million from the sale of the warrants. Taken together, the 
purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are intended to
offset any actual dilution from the conversion of these notes and to effectively
increase the overall conversion price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share in the 
case of warrants relating to 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to $560.64 in the case 
of warrants relating to 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain 
accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in 
stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost 
incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated 
balance sheet as of December 31, 2015.

1.50% Convertible Senior Notes and Bond Hedge and Warrant Transactions

In May 2013, we issued $660.0 million aggregate principal amount of 2018 Notes 
in a public offering. The net proceeds from the offering, after deducting 
transaction costs, were approximately $648.0 million. We incurred $12.0 million 
of debt issuance costs in connection with the issuance of the 2018 Notes which 
we recorded in other assets and are amortizing to interest expense using the 
effective interest method over the contractual term of the 2018 Notes. The 
interest under the 2018 Notes is fixed at 1.50% per annum and is payable 
semi-annually in arrears on June 1 and December 1 of each year, commencing on 
December 1, 2013.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2018 Notes will initially be convertible into 
8.0306 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion 
price of approximately $124.52 per share, subject to adjustment upon the 
occurrence of specified events. Holders of the 2018 Notes may convert their 2018
Notes at their option on or after March 1, 2018. Further, holders of the 2018 
Notes may convert their 2018 Notes at their option prior to March 1, 2018, only 
under the following circumstances: (1) during any fiscal quarter beginning after
the fiscal quarter ending September 30, 2013, if the last reported sale price of
our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) 
during the last 30 consecutive trading days of the immediately preceding fiscal 
quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on each 
applicable trading day; (2) during the five business day period following any 
five consecutive trading day period in which the trading price for the 2018 
Notes is less than 98% of the average of the closing sale price of our common 
stock for each day during such five trading day period; or (3) if we make 
specified distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate
transactions occur. Upon conversion, we would pay the holders in cash for the 
principal amount of the 2018 Notes and, if applicable, shares of our common 
stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such 
shares of our common stock) based on a calculated daily conversion value. If a 
fundamental change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2018 Notes 
may require us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2018 Notes for cash at a 
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount of the 2018 Notes, plus 
any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur
prior to the maturity date, we will increase the conversion rate for a holder 
who elects to convert its 2018 Notes in connection with such a corporate event 
in certain circumstances.

In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the 2018 Notes from 
the host debt instrument and recorded the conversion option of $82.8 million in 
stockholders’ equity. The resulting debt discount on the 2018 Notes is being 
amortized to interest expense at an effective interest rate of 4.29% over the 
contractual term of the 2018 Notes.

In connection with the offering of the 2018 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially 
(subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 million 
shares of our common stock at a price of approximately $124.52 per share. The 
cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was $177.5 million. In addition,
we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants have the option to purchase
initially (subject to certain specified events) a total of approximately 5.3 
million shares of our common stock at a price of $184.48 per share. We received 
$120.3 million in cash proceeds from the sale of these warrants. Taken together,
the purchase of the convertible note hedges and the sale of warrants are 
intended to offset any actual dilution from the conversion of the 2018 Notes and
to effectively increase the overall conversion price from $124.52 to $184.48 per
share. As these transactions meet certain accounting criteria, the convertible 
note hedges and warrants are recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not 
accounted for as derivatives. The net cost incurred in connection with the 
convertible note hedge and warrant transactions was recorded as a reduction to 
additional paid-in capital on the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 
2015.

During the fourth quarter of 2015, the closing price of our common stock 
exceeded 130% of the applicable conversion price of our 2018 Notes on at least 
20 of the last 30 consecutive trading days of the quarter; therefore, holders of
2018 Notes may convert their notes during the first quarter of 2016. As such, we
classified the $617.7 million carrying value of our 2018 Notes as current 
liabilities and classified $42.1 million, representing the difference between 
the aggregate principal of our 2018 Notes of $659.8 million and the carrying 
value of 2018 Notes, as mezzanine equity on our consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2015. Similarly, debt issuance costs were classified as other 
current assets as of December 31, 2015. Should the closing price conditions be 
met in the first quarter of 2016 or a future quarter, 2018 Notes will be 
convertible at their holders’ option during the immediately following quarter.

Convertible Senior Notes Carrying Value and Interest Expense

In accordance with accounting guidance on embedded conversion features, we 
valued and bifurcated the conversion option associated with the Notes from the 
respective host debt instrument and initially recorded the conversion option for
the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes in stockholders’ equity. The 
resulting debt discounts on the 2018 Notes, 2019 Notes, and 2021 Notes are being
amortized to interest expense at the effective interest rate over the 
contractual terms of the Notes.

                                                      December 31, 2015

Full Repayment of Department of Energy Loan Facility

On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing 
Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles 
Manufacturing (ATVM) Incentive Program. In May 2013, in connection with the 
closing of our offerings of common stock and Notes, we paid $451.8 million to 
settle all outstanding loan amounts of $441.0 million, including principal and 
interest, as well as an early repayment penalty of $10.8 million which was 
recorded in interest expense for the year ended December 31, 2013. Upon 
termination of the DOE Loan Facility, $29.3 million held in this dedicated 
account was released by the DOE.

As a result of our repayment of all outstanding principal and interest under the
DOE Loan Facility and the termination of the DOE Loan Facility in May 2013, the 
DOE warrant expired. As such, we recognized other income for the change in the 
fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of $10.7 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2013. Additionally, we amortized all remaining unamortized debt 
issuance costs of $5.8 million related to the DOE Loan Facility to interest 
expense for the year ended December 31, 2013.

Warehouse line of credit

In March 2015, we entered into a loan and security agreement (the “ Warehouse 
Facility”) for a secured asset based line of credit for a principal amount up to
$100 million. In June 2015, we amended the Warehouse Facility for an additional 
principal amount of $50 million, for a total of up to $150 million. Obligations 
under the Warehouse Facility were secured by certain of our lease contracts with
Tesla directly and the related leased vehicles. In connection with the Warehouse
Facility, we sold the beneficial interest in such lease contracts and related 
vehicles to a wholly owned special purpose entity that is the borrower in the 
Warehouse Facility, which pledged such beneficial interest in the underlying 
assets to the third-party lender under the Warehouse Facility. Borrowings under 
the Warehouse Facility are generally limited to up to 72% of the net present 
value of the remaining lease payments and the residual vehicle values under 
eligible lease contracts.

Interest was payable monthly on amounts borrowed under the Warehouse Facility at
a variable rate of LIBOR plus 1.65% and on undrawn amounts at a rate of 0.5%. 
The Warehouse facility would have matured in March 2017, at which time all 
outstanding borrowing would become due. Prior to that date, principal payments 
were due in the amount that the borrowing limit decreased below our outstanding 
principal balance. As of December 31, 2015, we had repaid all borrowings under 
the Warehouse Facility and terminated it.

Asset-Based Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior secured asset-based revolving credit 
agreement (the “ Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks, which we amended 
as of November 3, 2015. The Credit Agreement provides for a senior secured 
asset-based revolving credit facility (the “ Credit Facility”), which we may 
draw upon as needed. In October, lenders increased their total funding 
commitments to us under the Credit Facility by up to an additional $250.0 
million, subject to certain conditions, for total commitments up to $750 
million. In addition, the Credit Agreement provides for a $200.0 million letter 
of credit sub-facility and a $40.0 million swing-line loan sub-facility. The 
Credit Agreement is collateralized by a pledge of certain of our accounts 
receivable, inventory, and equipment, and availability under the Credit 
Agreement is based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves. 
In February 2016, we amended the Credit Agreement and increased the availability
and the commitments under the Credit Agreement from $750.0 million to $1.0 
billion.

Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% plus 
LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the 
lenders “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 
0.25% per annum. Interest is payable quarterly. The Credit Agreement terminates,
and all outstanding loans become due and payable, in June 2020. As of December 
31, 2015, we had $135.0 million borrowings under the Credit Facility.

We are required to meet various covenants, including meeting certain reporting 
requirements, such as the completion and presentation of audited consolidated 
financial statements for our borrowings. As of December 31, 2015 we were in 
compliance with all covenants contained in the Credit Agreement.

Pledged Assets

As of December 31, 2015 and 2014, we have pledged or restricted $1.43 billion 
and $29.3 million principally from finished goods and raw materials inventory, 
as well as certain property and equipment, direct lease vehicles, receivables 
and cash as collateral for letters of credit including our Asset-based credit 
arrangement, real estate leases, and insurance policies.
