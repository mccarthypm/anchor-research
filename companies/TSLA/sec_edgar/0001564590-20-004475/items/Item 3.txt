For a description of our material pending legal proceedings, please see Note 16, Commitments and Contingencies, to the consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this Annual Report on Form 10-K.

In addition, the following matters are being disclosed pursuant to Item 103 of Regulation S-K because they relate to environmental regulations and aggregate civil penalties could potentially exceed $100,000.

The Bay Area Air Quality Management District (the “BAAQMD”) has issued notices of violation to us relating to air permitting for the Fremont Factory, but has not initiated formal proceedings. We dispute certain of these allegations and are working to resolve them with the BAAQMD. Further, we assert that there has been no related adverse community or environmental impact. While we cannot predict the outcome of this matter, including the final amount of any penalties, it is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our business.

We have also received an information request from the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (the “EPA”) under Section 114(a) of the Clean Air Act of 1963, as amended (the “Clean Air Act”). The EPA is reviewing the compliance of our Fremont Factory operations with applicable requirements under the Clean Air Act, and we are working with the EPA in responding to this request. While the outcome of this matter cannot be determined at this time, it is not currently expected to have a material adverse impact on our business.
