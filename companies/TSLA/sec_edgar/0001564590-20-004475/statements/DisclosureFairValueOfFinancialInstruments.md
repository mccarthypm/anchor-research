| **  Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | Note 5 - Fair Value of Financial Instruments

ASC 820, Fair Value Measurements, states that fair value is an exit price, 
representing the amount that would be received to sell an asset or paid to 
transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants. As 
such, fair value is a market-based measurement that should be determined based 
on assumptions that market participants would use in pricing an asset or a 
liability. The three-tiered fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs
should be used in measuring fair value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable 
inputs such as quoted prices in active markets; (Level II) inputs other than 
quoted prices in active markets that are observable either directly or 
indirectly and (Level III) unobservable inputs for which there is little or no 
market data. The fair value hierarchy requires the use of observable market data
when available in determining fair value. Our assets and liabilities that were 
measured at fair value on a recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

All of our money market funds were classified within Level I of the fair value 
hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in active markets. Our 
interest rate swaps were classified within Level II of the fair value hierarchy 
because they were valued using alternative pricing sources or models that 
utilized market observable inputs, including current and forward interest rates.
During the year ended December 31, 2019, there were no transfers between the 
levels of the fair value hierarchy.

Interest Rate Swaps

We enter into fixed-for-floating interest rate swap agreements to swap variable 
interest payments on certain debt for fixed interest payments, as required by 
certain of our lenders. We do not designate our interest rate swaps as hedging 
instruments. Accordingly, our interest rate swaps are recorded at fair value on 
the consolidated balance sheets within other assets or other long-term 
liabilities, with any changes in their fair values recognized as other income 
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations and with any cash 
flows recognized as investing activities in the consolidated statements of cash 
flows. Our interest rate swaps outstanding were as follows (in millions):

Disclosure of Fair Values

Our financial instruments that are not re-measured at fair value include 
accounts receivable, MyPower customer notes receivable, rebates receivable, 
accounts payable, accrued liabilities, customer deposits, participation interest
and debt. The carrying values of these financial instruments other than our 
1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021, 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 
in 2022 and 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 and our subsidiary’s 
Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020 (collectively referred to as 
“Convertible Senior Notes” below), 5.30% Senior Notes due in 2025, solar 
asset-backed notes and solar loan-backed notes approximate their fair values.

We estimate the fair value of the Convertible Senior Notes and the 5.30% Senior 
Notes due in 2025 using commonly accepted valuation methodologies and 
market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable, such as credit 
risk (Level II). In addition, we estimate the fair values of our solar 
asset-backed notes and solar loan-backed notes based on rates currently offered 
for instruments with similar maturities and terms (Level III). The following 
table presents the estimated fair values and the carrying values (in millions):
