We have a 401(k) savings plan that is intended to qualify as a deferred salary 
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) 
savings plan, participating employees may elect to contribute up to 100% of 
their eligible compensation, subject to certain limitations. Participants are 
fully vested in their contributions. We did not make any contributions to the 
401(k) savings plan during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 
(other than employee deferrals of eligible compensation).
