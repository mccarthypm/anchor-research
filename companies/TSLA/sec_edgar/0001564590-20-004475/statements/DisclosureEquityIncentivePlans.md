| **  Equity Incentive Plans** | Note 14 - Equity Incentive Plans

In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”), and 
simultaneously terminated the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2010 Plan”). No 
new awards have been granted under the 2010 Plan following the adoption of the 
2019 Plan, but such termination did not affect outstanding awards under the 2010
Plan. The 2019 Plan has similar terms as the 2010 Plan and provides for the 
granting of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock appreciation rights, 
performance units and performance shares to our employees, directors and 
consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be either incentive 
stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock options may only be
granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be granted to our 
employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock options and RSUs vest
over four years and our stock options are exercisable over a maximum period of 
10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically terminates when the 
employment or consulting relationship ends.

As of December 31, 2019, 11 million shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2019 Plan.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity:

The weighted-average grant date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 
31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $282.74, $316.46 and $308.71, respectively. The 
aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended December 31, 2019, 
2018 and 2017 was $502 million, $546 million and $491 million, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised in the years ended December 
31, 2019, 2018, and 2017 was $237 million, $293 million and $544 million, 
respectively.

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the 
grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the 
weighted-average assumptions in the following table:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is 
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common 
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield for 
zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s 
expected life. Prior to the fourth quarter of 2017, given our then limited 
history with employee grants, we used the “simplified” method in estimating the 
expected term of our employee grants; the simplified method utilizes the average
of the time-to-vesting and the contractual life of the employee grant. Beginning
with the fourth quarter of 2017, we use our historical data in estimating the 
expected term of our employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the 
average of the implied volatility of publicly traded options for our common 
stock and the historical volatility of our common stock.

2018 CEO Performance Award

In March 2018, our stockholders approved the Board of Directors’ grant of 
20,264,042 stock option awards to our CEO (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). 
The 2018 CEO Performance Award consists of 12 vesting tranches with a vesting 
schedule based entirely on the attainment of both operational milestones 
(performance conditions) and market conditions, assuming continued employment 
either as the CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer and 
service through each vesting date. Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 
CEO Performance Award will vest upon certification by the Board of Directors 
that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins
at $100 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50 billion
thereafter, and (ii) any one of the following eight operational milestones 
focused on revenue or eight operational milestones focused on Adjusted EBITDA 
have been met for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters on an annualized
basis. Adjusted EBITDA is defined as net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders before interest expense, provision (benefit) for income taxes, 
depreciation and amortization and stock-based compensation.

                   $ 175.0                           $14.0  

As of December 31, 2019, two operational milestones have been achieved: (i) 
$20.0 billion total annualized revenue and (ii) $1.5 billion annualized adjusted
EBITDA, each subject to the formal certification by our Board of Directors, 
while no market capitalization milestones have been achieved. Consequently, no 
shares subject to the 2018 CEO Performance Award have vested as of the date of 
this filing.

As of December 31, 2019, the following operational milestones were considered 
probable of achievement:

  Adjusted EBITDA of $3.0 billion  

  Total revenue of $35.0 billion  

Stock-based compensation expense associated with each tranche under the 2018 CEO
Performance Award is recognized over the longer of (i) the expected achievement 
period for the operational milestone for such tranche and (ii) the expected 
achievement period for the related market capitalization milestone determined on
the grant date, beginning at the point in time when the relevant operational 
milestone is considered probable of being met. If such operational milestone 
becomes probable any time after the grant date, we will recognize a cumulative 
catch-up expense from the grant date to that point in time. If the related 
market capitalization milestone is achieved earlier than its expected 
achievement period and the achievement of the related operational milestone, 
then the stock-based compensation expense will be recognized over the expected 
achievement period for the operational milestone, which may accelerate the rate 
at which such expense is recognized.

The market capitalization milestone period and the valuation of each tranche are
determined using a Monte Carlo simulation and is used as the basis for 
determining the expected achievement period. The probability of meeting an 
operational milestone is based on a subjective assessment of our future 
financial projections. No tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will vest 
unless a market capitalization and a matching operational milestone are both 
achieved. The first tranche of the 2018 CEO Performance Award will not vest 
unless our market capitalization were to approximately double from the initial 
level at the time the award was approved, based on both a six calendar month 
trailing average and a 30 calendar day trailing average (counting only trading 
days). Upon vesting of a tranche, all unamortized expense for the tranche will 
be recognized immediately. Additionally, stock-based compensation represents a 
non-cash expense and is recorded as a selling, general, and administrative 
operating expense in our consolidated statement of operations.

As of December 31, 2019, we had $527 million of total unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense for the operational milestones that were considered 
probable of achievement, which will be recognized over a weighted-average period
of 2.72 years. As of December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense of $1.29 billion for the operational milestones that were 
considered not probable of achievement. For the year ended December 31, 2019, we
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $296 million related to the 2018 
CEO Performance Award. From March 21, 2018, when the grant was approved by our 
stockholders, through December 31, 2018, we recorded stock-based compensation 
expense of $175 million related to this award. The increase in stock-based 
compensation expense was primarily related to a $72 million cumulative catch-up 
expense for the service provided from the grant date when an additional 
operational milestone was considered probable of being met in the fourth quarter
of 2019 and a shorter expense period in the prior year.

2014 Performance-Based Stock Option Awards

In 2014, to create incentives for continued long-term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with our stockholders’ interests in 
the achievement of significant milestones by us, the Compensation Committee of 
our Board of Directors granted stock option awards to certain employees 
(excluding our CEO) to purchase an aggregate of 1,073,000 shares of our common 
stock. Each award consisted of the following four vesting tranches with the 
vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of the future performance 
milestones, assuming continued employment and service through each vesting date:

  1/4 th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model X production 
vehicle;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving aggregate production of 100,000 
vehicles in a trailing 12-month period;  

  1/4th of each award vests upon completion of the first Model 3 production 
vehicle; and  

  1/4th of each award vests upon achieving an annualized gross margin of greater
than 30% for any three-year period.  

As of December 31, 2019, the following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle; and  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles in a trailing 12-month period.  

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each performance 
milestone becomes probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2019, we had 
unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $5 million for the performance 
milestone that was considered not probable of achievement. For the years ended 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, we did not record any additional stock-based 
compensation related to these awards. For the year ended December 2017, we 
recorded stock-based compensation expense of $7 million related to these awards.

2012 CEO Performance Award

In August 2012, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock option awards to 
our CEO (the “2012 CEO Performance Award”). The 2012 CEO Performance Award 
consists of 10 vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions, assuming 
continued employment and service through each vesting date. Each vesting tranche
requires a combination of a pre-determined performance milestone and an 
incremental increase in our market capitalization of $4.00 billion, as compared 
to our initial market capitalization of $3.20 billion at the time of grant. As 
ofDecember 31, 2019, the market capitalization conditions for all of the vesting
tranches and the following performance milestones had been achieved:

  Successful completion of the Model X alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model X beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model X production vehicle;  

  Aggregate production of 100,000 vehicles;  

  Successful completion of the Model 3 alpha prototype;  
 ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Successful completion of the Model 3 beta prototype;  
 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  Completion of the first Model 3 production vehicle;  

  Aggregate production of 200,000 vehicles; and  

  Aggregate production of 300,000 vehicles.  

We begin recognizing stock-based compensation expense as each milestone becomes 
probable of achievement. As of December 31, 2019, we had unrecognized 
stock-based compensation expense of $6 million for the performance milestone 
that was considered not probable of achievement. For the year ended December 31,
2019, we recorded no stock-based compensation expense related to the 2012 CEO 
Performance Award. For the year ended December 31, 2018, the stock-based 
compensation we recorded related to this award was immaterial. For the year 
ended December 31, 2017, we recorded stock-based compensation expense of $5 
million related to this award.

Our CEOearns a base salary that reflects the currently applicable minimum wage 
requirements under California law, and he is subject to income taxes based on 
such base salary. However, he has never accepted hissalary. Commencing in May 
2019 at our CEO’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of 
his base salary.

$         749      $         467  

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the 
periods presented due to cumulative losses and valuation allowances. As of 
December 31, 2019, we had $1.57 billion of total unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 2.91 years.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we issued 0.5 million, 
0.4 million and 0.4 million shares under the ESPP with an associated expense of 
$40 million, $109 million and $71 million, respectively. There were 7 million 
shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2019.
