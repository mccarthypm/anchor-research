Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our 
subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net 
carrying values are due to convertible senior note conversion features, debt 
discounts or deferred financing costs. As of December 31, 2019, we were in 
material compliance with all financial debt covenants, which include minimum 
liquidity and expense-coverage balances and ratios.

2019 Notes, 2021 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In March 2014, we issued $800 million in aggregate principal amount of 0.25% 
Convertible Senior Notes due in March 2019 and $1.20 billion in aggregate 
principal amount of 1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in March 2021 in a public
offering. In April 2014, we issued an additional $120 million in aggregate 
principal amount of the 2019 Notes and $180 million in aggregate principal 
amount of the 2021 Notes, pursuant to the exercise in full of the overallotment 
options by the underwriters. The total net proceeds from the issuances, after 
deducting transaction costs, were $906 million for the 2019 Notes and $1.36 
billion for the 2021 Notes.

Each $1,000 of principal of these notes is initially convertible into 2.7788 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of $359.87 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified 
events. Holders of these notes had the option to convert on or after December 1,
2018 for the 2019 Notes and may elect to convert on or after December 1, 2020 
for the 2021 Notes. The settlement of such an election to convert the 2019 Notes
was in cash and/or shares of our common stock, which we settled in cash on the 
maturity date. The settlement of such an election to convert the 2021 Notes 
would be in cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, cash and/or shares
of our common stock for any conversion premium at our election. Further, holders
of these notes may convert, at their option, prior to the respective dates above
only under the following circumstances: (1) during a quarter in which the 
closing price of our common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not 
consecutive) during the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding 
the quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during
the five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period 
in which the trading price of these notes is less than 98% of the product of the
closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for each 
day during such five-consecutive trading day period, or (3) if we make specified
distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate 
transactions occur. Upon such a conversion of the 2019 Notes, we would pay or 
deliver (as applicable) cash, shares of our common stock or a combination 
thereof, at our election. Upon such a conversion of the 2021 Notes, we would pay
cash for the principal amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of our common 
stock (subject to our right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such 
shares of our common stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental 
change occurs prior to the applicable maturity date, holders of these notes may 
require us to repurchase all or a portion of their notes for cash at a 
repurchase price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and 
unpaid interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the 
applicable maturity date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who
elects to convert their notes in connection with such an event in certain 
circumstances. As of December 31, 2019, none of the conditions permitting the 
holders of 2021 to early convert had been met. Therefore, the 2021 Notes are 
classified as long-term.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion features associated with these notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $188 million for the 2019 Notes’ conversion 
feature and $369 million for the 2021 Notes’ conversion feature. The resulting 
debt discounts are being amortized to interest expense at an effective interest 
rate of 4.89% and 5.96%, respectively.

In connection with the offering of these notes in March and April 2014, we 
entered into convertible note hedge transactions whereby we had the option to 
purchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock for the 2019 Notes and have the 
option to purchase initially (subject to adjustment for certain specified 
events) 3.8 million shares of our common stock for the 2021 Notes at a price of 
$359.87 per share. The total cost of the convertible note hedge transactions was
$604 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the holders of the warrants 
had the option to purchase 2.6 million shares of our common stock at a price of 
$512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes and have the option to purchase initially 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.8 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $560.64 per share for the 2021 Notes. We received 
$389 million in total cash proceeds from the sales of these warrants. Taken 
together, the purchases of the convertible note hedges and the sales of the 
warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution and/or cash payments from the
conversion of these notes and to effectively increase the overall conversion 
price from $359.87 to $512.66 per share for the 2019 Notes and from $359.87 to 
$560.64 per share for the 2021 Notes. As these transactions meet certain 
accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are recorded in 
stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The net cost 
incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant transactions 
was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the consolidated 
balance sheet.

During the first quarter of 2019, we repaid the $920 million in aggregate 
principal amount of the 2019 Notes. As of December 31, 2019, the convertible 
note hedges and warrants associated with the 2019 Notes have expired.

As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the 2021 Notes exceeds the 
outstanding principal amount by $224 million.

2022 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In March 2017, we issued $978 million in aggregate principal amount of 2.375% 
Convertible Senior Notes due in March 2022 in a public offering. The net 
proceeds from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $966 
million.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2022 Notes is initially convertible into 3.0534 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of $327.50 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified 
events. Holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after 
December 15, 2021. Further, holders of the 2022 Notes may convert, at their 
option, prior to December 15, 2021 only under the following circumstances: (1) 
during any quarter beginning after June 30, 2017, if the closing price of our 
common stock for at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during 
the last 30 consecutive trading days immediately preceding the quarter is 
greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price; (2) during the 
five-business day period following any five-consecutive trading day period in 
which the trading price of the 2022 Notes is less than 98% of the product of the
closing price of our common stock and the applicable conversion rate for each 
day during such five-consecutive trading day period or (3) if we make specified 
distributions to holders of our common stock or if specified corporate 
transactions occur. Upon a conversion, we would pay cash for the principal 
amount and, if applicable, deliver shares of our common stock (subject to our 
right to deliver cash in lieu of all or a portion of such shares of our common 
stock) based on a daily conversion value. If a fundamental change occurs prior 
to the maturity date, holders of the 2022 Notes may require us to repurchase all
or a portion of their 2022 Notes for cash at a repurchase price equal to 100% of
the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid interest. In addition, if 
specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity date, we would increase 
the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert its 2022 Notes in 
connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of December 31, 2019,
none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2022 Notes to early convert
had been met. Therefore, the 2022 Notes are classified as long-term.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2022 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $146 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of 6.00%.

In connection with the offering of the 2022 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $327.50 per share. The cost of the convertible note 
hedge transactions was $204 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the 
holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to 
adjustment for certain specified events) 3.0 million shares of our common stock 
at a price of $655.00 per share. We received $53 million in cash proceeds from 
the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note
hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution 
from the conversion of the 2022 Notes and to effectively increase the overall 
conversion price from $327.50 to $655.00 per share. As these transactions meet 
certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are 
recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The 
net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant 
transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the 
consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the 
outstanding principal amount by $271 million.

2024 Notes, Bond Hedges and Warrant Transactions

In May 2019, we issued $1.84 billion in aggregate principal amount of 2.00% 
Convertible Senior Notes due inMay 2024in a public offering. The net proceeds 
from the issuance, after deducting transaction costs, were $1.82 billion.

Each $1,000 of principal of the 2024 Notes is initially convertible into 3.2276 
shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to an initial conversion price 
of $309.83 per share, subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified 
events. Holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their option, on or after 
February 15, 2024. Further, holders of the 2024 Notes may convert, at their 
option, prior to February 15, 2024 only under the following circumstances: (1) 
during any calendar quarter commencing after September 30, 2019 (and only during
such calendar quarter), if the last reported sale price of our common stock for 
at least 20 trading days (whether or not consecutive) during a period of 30 
consecutive trading days ending on the last trading day of immediately preceding
calendar quarter is greater than or equal to 130% of the conversion price on 
each trading day; (2) during the five-business day period after any 
five-consecutive trading day period in which the trading price per $1,000 
principal amount of the 2024 Notes for each trading day of such period is less 
than 98% of the product of the last reported sale price of our common stock and 
the conversion rate on each such trading day, or (3) if specified corporate 
events occur. Upon conversion, the 2024 Notes will be settled in cash, shares of
our common stock or a combination thereof, at our election. If a fundamental 
change occurs prior to the maturity date, holders of the 2024 Notes may require 
us to repurchase all or a portion of their 2024 Notes for cash at a repurchase 
price equal to 100% of the principal amount plus any accrued and unpaid 
interest. In addition, if specific corporate events occur prior to the maturity 
date, we would increase the conversion rate for a holder who elects to convert 
its 2024 Notes in connection with such an event in certain circumstances. As of 
December 31, 2019, none of the conditions permitting the holders of the 2024 
Notes to early convert had been met. Therefore, the 2024 Notes are classified as
long-term.

In accordance with GAAP relating to embedded conversion features, we initially 
valued and bifurcated the conversion feature associated with the 2024 Notes. We 
recorded to stockholders’ equity $491 million for the conversion feature. The 
resulting debt discount is being amortized to interest expense at an effective 
interest rate of 8.68%.

In connection with the offering of the 2024 Notes, we entered into convertible 
note hedge transactions whereby we have the option to purchase initially 
(subject to adjustment for certain specified events) 5.9 million shares of our 
common stock at a price of $309.83 per share. The cost of the convertible note 
hedge transactions was $476 million. In addition, we sold warrants whereby the 
holders of the warrants have the option to purchase initially (subject to 
adjustment for certain specified events) 5.9 million shares of our common stock 
at a price of $607.50 per share. We received $174 million in cash proceeds from 
the sale of these warrants. Taken together, the purchase of the convertible note
hedges and the sale of the warrants are intended to reduce potential dilution 
from the conversion of the 2024 Notes and to effectively increase the overall 
conversion price from $309.83 to $607.50 per share. As these transactions meet 
certain accounting criteria, the convertible note hedges and warrants are 
recorded in stockholders’ equity and are not accounted for as derivatives. The 
net cost incurred in connection with the convertible note hedge and warrant 
transactions was recorded as a reduction to additional paid-in capital on the 
consolidated balance sheet.

As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the 
outstanding principal amount by $644 million.

2025 Notes

In August 2017, we issued $1.80 billion in aggregate principal amount of 
unsecured 5.30% Senior Notes due in August 2025 pursuant to Rule 144A and 
Regulation S under the Securities Act. The net proceeds from the issuance, after
deducting transaction costs, were $1.77 billion.

Credit Agreement

In June 2015, we entered into a senior asset-based revolving credit agreement 
(as amended from time to time, the “Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of 
banks. Borrowed funds bear interest, at our option, at an annual rate of (a) 1% 
plus LIBOR or (b) the highest of (i) the federal funds rate plus 0.50%, (ii) the
lenders’ “prime rate” or (iii) 1% plus LIBOR. The fee for undrawn amounts is 
0.25% per annum. The Credit Agreement is secured by certain of our accounts 
receivable, inventory and equipment. Availability under the Credit Agreement is 
based on the value of such assets, as reduced by certain reserves.

In March 2019, we amended and restated the Credit Agreement to increase the 
total lender commitments by $500 million to $2.425 billion and extend the term 
of substantially all of the total commitments to July 2023.

1.625% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019

In 2014, SolarCity issued $566 million in aggregate principal amount of 1.625% 
Convertible Senior Notes due on November 1, 2019 in a private placement.

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes was convertible into 
1.3169 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$759.36 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events
related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). The maximum conversion 
rate was capped at 1.7449 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible
senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $573.10 per 
share. The convertible senior notes did not have a cash conversion option and 
the convertible senior note holders could require us to repurchase their 
convertible senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental 
changes.

In November 2019, we fully repaid $566 million in aggregate principal amount of 
the Notes.

Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due in 2020

In December 2015, SolarCity issued $113 million in aggregate principal amount of
Zero-Coupon Convertible Senior Notes due on December 1, 2020 in a private 
placement. $13 million of the convertible senior notes were issued to related 
parties (see Note 20, Related Party Transactions).

Each $1,000 of principal of the convertible senior notes is now convertible into
3.3333 shares of our common stock, which is equivalent to a conversion price of 
$300.00 per share (subject to adjustment upon the occurrence of specified events
related to dividends, tender offers or exchange offers). The maximum conversion 
rate is capped at 4.2308 shares for each $1,000 of principal of the convertible 
senior notes, which is equivalent to a minimum conversion price of $236.36 per 
share. The convertible senior notes do not have a cash conversion option. The 
convertible senior note holders may require us to repurchase their convertible 
senior notes for cash only under certain defined fundamental changes. On or 
after June 30, 2017, the convertible senior notes are redeemable by us in the 
event that the closing price of our common stock exceeds 200% of the conversion 
price for 45 consecutive trading days ending within three trading days of such 
redemption notice at a redemption price equal to 100% of the principal amount 
plus any accrued and unpaid interest.

As of December 31, 2019, the if-converted value of the notes exceeds the 
outstanding principal amount by $41 million.

Solar Bonds and other Loans

Solar Bonds are senior unsecured obligations that are structurally subordinate 
to the indebtedness and other liabilities of our subsidiaries. Solar Bonds were 
issued under multiple series with various terms and interest rates. 
Additionally, we have assumed the 5.50% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2022 
issued by Maxwell, which are convertible into shares of our common stock as a 
result of our acquisition of Maxwell.

Automotive Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, we transfer receivables or beneficial interests related to 
certain leased vehicles into SPEs and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, 
backed by these automotive assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the
financial statements. The cash flows generated by these automotive assets are 
used to service the principal and interest payments on the Automotive 
Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is 
distributed to the owners of the SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the 
associated customer lease contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition 
policy. The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other 
creditors, and the creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed 
Note holders, have no recourse to our other assets. A third-party contracted 
with us to provide administrative and collection services for these automotive 
assets.

In November 2019, we issued $861 million in aggregate principal amount of 
Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the issuance, net of discounts 
and fees, were $857 million.

Solar Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, our subsidiaries pool and transfer either qualifying solar 
energy systems and the associated customer contracts or our interests in certain
financing funds into Special Purpose Entities (“SPEs”) and issue Solar 
Asset-backed Notes backed by these solar assets or interests to investors. The 
SPEs are wholly owned by us and are consolidated in the financial statements. 
The cash flows generated by these solar assets or distributed by the underlying 
financing funds to certain SPEs are used to service the principal and interest 
payments on the Solar Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses, and any
remaining cash is distributed to us. We recognize revenue earned from the 
associated customer contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy.
The SPEs’ assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and 
the creditors of the SPEs, including the Solar Asset-backed Note holders, have 
no recourse to our other assets. We contracted with the SPEs to provide 
operations & maintenance and administrative services for the solar energy 
systems. As of December 31, 2019, solar assets pledged as collateral for Solar 
Asset-backed Notes had a carrying value of $690 million and are included within 
solar energy systems, net, on the consolidated balance sheets.

China Loan Agreements

In March 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a 
syndicate of lenders in China for a bridge loan to be used for expenditures 
related to the construction of and production at our Gigafactory Shanghai. The 
loan agreement was terminated in December 2019.

In September 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement with a 
lender in China for an unsecured 12-month revolving facility of up to RMB 5.0 
billion (or the equivalent drawn in U. S. dollars), to finance vehicles 
in-transit to China. Borrowed funds bear interest at an annual rate no greater 
than 90% of the one-year rate published by the People’s Bank of China. The loan 
facility is non-recourse to our assets.

In December 2019, one of our subsidiaries entered into loan agreements with a 
syndicate of lenders in China for: (i) a secured term loan facility of up to RMB
9.0 billion or the equivalent amount drawn in U. S. dollars (the “Fixed Asset 
Facility”) and (ii) an unsecured revolving loan facility of up to RMB 2.25 
billion or the equivalent amount drawn in U. S. dollars (the “Working Capital 
Facility”), in each case to be used in connection with our construction of and 
production at our Gigafactory Shanghai. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the 
Fixed Asset Facility accrue interest at a rate equal to: (i) for RMB-denominated
loans, the market quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China 
minus 0.7625%, and (ii) for U. S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year 
LIBOR plus 1.3%. Outstanding borrowings pursuant to the Working Capital Facility
accrue interest at a rate equal to: (i) for RMB-denominated loans, the market 
quoted interest rate published by the People’s Bank of China minus 0.4525%, and 
(ii) for U. S. dollar-denominated loans, the sum of one-year LIBOR plus 0.8%. 
The Fixed Asset Facility is secured by the land and buildings at Gigafactory 
Shanghai and both facilities are non-recourse to our other assets.

Cash Equity Debt

In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our 
subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that 
bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our 
interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

Solar Loan-backed Notes

receivable to investors. Accordingly, we did not recognize a gain or loss on the
transfer of these notes receivable. The SPEs are wholly owned by us and are 
consolidated in the financial statements. The payments received by the SPEs from
these notes receivable are used to service the semi-annual principal and 
interest payments on the Solar Loan-backed Notes and satisfy the SPEs’ expenses,

In August 2016, our subsidiaries entered into a loan and security agreement (the
“2016 Warehouse Agreement”) for borrowings secured by the future cash flows 
arising from certain leases and the associated leased vehicles. On August 17, 
2017, the 2016 Warehouse Agreement was amended to modify the interest rates and 
extend the availability period and the maturity date, and our subsidiaries 
entered into another loan and security agreement (the “2017 Warehouse 
Agreement”) with substantially the same terms as and that shares the same 
committed amount with the 2016 Warehouse Agreement. On August 16, 2018, the 2016
Warehouse Agreement and 2017 Warehouse Agreement were amended to extend the 
availability period from August 17, 2018 to August 16, 2019 and extend the 
maturity date from September 2019 toSeptember 2020. On December 28, 2018, our

future cash flows arising from certain leases and the related leased vehicles 
has been sold for legal purposes but continues to be reported in the 
consolidated financial statements. The interest in the future cash flows arising
from these leases and the related vehicles is not available to pay the claims of
our creditors other than pursuant to obligations to the lenders under the 
Warehouse Agreements. Any excess cash flows not required to pay obligations 
under the Warehouse Agreements are available for distributions.

availability period from August 16, 2019 to August 14, 2020 and extend the 
maturity date from September 2020 toSeptember 2021.

In November 2019, we repaid $723 million of the principal outstanding under the 
Warehouse Agreements.
