  (1)      Accrued purchases primarily reflects receipts of goods and services 
that we had not been invoiced yet. As we are invoiced for these goods and 
services, this balance will reduce and accounts pay...  

  (2)      Taxes payable includes value added tax, sales tax, property tax, use 
tax and income tax payables.  

Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2019, we 
increased our sales return reserve significantly on vehicles previously sold 
under our buyback options program. See Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies for details.

As of December 31, 2018, the table above included $82 million of current 
build-to-suit lease liabilities. As a result of the adoption of the new lease 
standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all build-to-suit lease 
liabilities and have reassessed these leases to be operating lease right-of-use 
liabilities as of December 31, 2019.
