  (1)      Finished goods inventory includes vehicles in transit to fulfill 
customer orders, new vehicles available for sale, used vehicles and energy 
storage products.  

For solar energy systems, we commence transferring component parts from 
inventory to construction in progress, a component of solar energy systems, once
a lease or PPA contract with a customer has been executed and installation has 
been initiated. Additional costs incurred on the leased solar energy systems, 
including labor and overhead, are recorded within construction in progress.

We write-down inventory for any excess or obsolete inventories or when we 
believe that the net realizable value of inventories is less than the carrying 
value. During the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded 
write-downs of $138 million, $78 million and $124 million, respectively, in cost
of revenues.
