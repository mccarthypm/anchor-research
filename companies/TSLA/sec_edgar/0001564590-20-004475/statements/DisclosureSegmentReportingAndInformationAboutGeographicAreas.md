We have two operating and reportable segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy 
generation and storage. The automotive segment includes the design, development,
manufacturing, sales, and leasing of electric vehicles as well as sales of 
automotive regulatory credits. Additionally, the automotive segment is also 
comprised of services and other, which includes non-warranty after-sales vehicle
services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired 
subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue. The energy
generation and storage segment includes the design, manufacture, installation, 
sales, and leasing of solar energy generation and energy storage products and 
related services and sales of solar energy systems incentives. Our CODM does not
evaluate operating segments using asset or liability information. The following 
table presents revenues and gross profit by reportable segment (in millions):
