| **  Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation** | Note 18 - Lease Pass-Through Financing Obligation

Through December 31, 2019, we had entered into eight transactions referred to as
“lease pass-through fund arrangements”. Under these arrangements, our wholly 
owned subsidiaries finance the cost of solar energy systems with investors 
through arrangements contractually structured as master leases for an initial 
term ranging between10 and 25 years. These solar energy systems are subject to 
lease or PPAs with customers with an initial term not exceeding 25 years. These 
solar energy systems are included within solar energy systems, net on the 
consolidated balance sheets.

The cost of the solar energy systems under lease pass-through fund arrangements 
as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was$1.05billion. The accumulated depreciation 
on these assets as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $101 million and $66 
million, respectively. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of 
December 31, 2019 was $94 million, of which $57 million is classified as a 
current liability. The total lease pass-through financing obligation as of 
December 31, 2018 was $112 million, of which $62 million was classified as a 
current liability. Lease pass-through financing obligation is included in 
accrued liabilities and other for the current portion and other long-term 
liabilities for the long-term portion on the consolidated balance sheets.

Under a lease pass-through fund arrangement, the investor makes a large upfront 
payment to the lessor, which is one of our subsidiaries, and in some cases, 
subsequent periodic payments. We allocate a portion of the aggregate investor 
payments to the fair value of the assigned ITCs, which is estimated by 
discounting the projected cash flow impact of the ITCs using a market interest 
rate and is accounted for separately (see Note 2, Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies). We account for the remainder of the investor payments as a
borrowing by recording the proceeds received as a lease pass-through financing 
obligation, which is repaid from the future customer lease payments and any 
incentive rebates. A portion of the amounts received by the investor is 
allocated to interest expense using the effective interest rate method.

The lease pass-through financing obligation is non-recourse once the associated 
solar energy systems have been placed in-service and the associated customer 
arrangements have been assigned to the investors. However, we are required to 
comply with certain financial covenants specified in the contractual agreements,
which we had met as of December 31, 2019. In addition, we are responsible for 
any warranties, performance guarantees, accounting and performance reporting. 
Furthermore, we continue to account for the customer arrangements and any 
incentive rebates in the consolidated financial statements, regardless of 
whether the cash is received by us or directly by the investors.

As of December 31, 2019, the future minimum master lease payments to be received
from investors, for each of the next five years and thereafter, were as follows 
(in millions):

  2020             42  
  2021             41  
  2022             33  
  2023             26  
  2024             18  
  Thereafter      450  
  Total           610  

For two of the lease pass-through fund arrangements, our subsidiaries have 
pledged its assets to the investors as security for its obligations under the 
contractual agreements.

Each lease pass-through fund arrangement has a one-time master lease prepayment 
adjustment mechanism that occurs when the capacity and the placed-in-service 
dates of the associated solar energy systems are finalized or on an agreed-upon 
date. As part of this mechanism, the master lease prepayment amount is updated, 
and we may be obligated to refund a portion of a master lease prepayment or 
entitled to receive an additional master lease prepayment. Any additional master
lease prepayments are recorded as an additional lease pass-through financing 
obligation while any master lease prepayment refunds would reduce the lease 
pass-through financing obligation.
