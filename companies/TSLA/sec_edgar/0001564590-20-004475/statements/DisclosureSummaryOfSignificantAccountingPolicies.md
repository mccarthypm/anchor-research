Principles of Consolidation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared in 
conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting principles (“GAAP”) and 
reflect our accounts and operations and those of our subsidiaries in which we 
have a controlling financial interest. In accordance with the provisions of 
Accounting Standards Codification (“ASC”) 810, Consolidation, we consolidate any
variable interest entity (“VIE”) of which we are the primary beneficiary. We 
form VIEs with financing fund investors in the ordinary course of business in 
order to facilitate the funding and monetization of certain attributes 
associated with solar energy systems and leases under our direct vehicle leasing
programs. The typical condition for a controlling financial interest ownership 
is holding a majority of the voting interests of an entity; however, a 
controlling financial interest may also exist in entities, such as VIEs, through
arrangements that do not involve controlling voting interests. ASC 810 requires 
a variable interest holder to consolidate a VIE if that party has the power to 
direct the activities of the VIE that most significantly impact the VIE’s 
economic performance and the obligation to absorb losses of the VIE that could 
potentially be significant to the VIE or the right to receive benefits from the 
VIE that could potentially be significant to the VIE. We do not consolidate a 
VIE in which we have a majority ownership interest when we are not considered 
the primary beneficiary. We have determined that we are the primary beneficiary 
of all the VIEs (see Note17, Variable Interest Entity Arrangements). We evaluate
our relationships with all the VIEs on an ongoing basis to ensure that we 
continue to be the primary beneficiary. All intercompany transactions and 
balances have been eliminated upon consolidation.

Use of Estimates

The preparation of financial statements in conformity with GAAP requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of
assets, liabilities and disclosures in the accompanying notes. Estimates are 
used for, but not limited to, determining the transaction price of products and 
services in arrangements with multiple performance obligations and determining 
the amortization period of these obligations, significant economic incentive for
residual value guarantee arrangements, sales return reserves, the collectability
of accounts receivable, inventory valuation, fair value of long-lived assets, 
goodwill, fair value of financial instruments, residual value of operating lease
vehicles, depreciable lives of property and equipment and solar energy systems, 
fair value and residual value of solar energy systems subject to leases, 
warranty liabilities, income taxes, contingencies, determining lease 
pass-through financing obligations, the valuation of build-to-suit lease assets,
fair value of interest rate swaps and inputs used to value stock-based 
compensation. In addition, estimates and assumptions are used for the accounting
for business combinations, including the fair values and useful lives of 
acquired assets, assumed liabilities and noncontrolling interests. Management 
bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions 
believed to be reasonable, the results of which form the basis for making 
judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities. Actual results 
could differ from those estimates.

Revenue Recognition

Adoption of new accounting standards

ASU 2014-09, Revenue - Revenue from Contracts with Customers. On January 1, 
2018, we adopted the new accounting standard ASC 606, Revenue from Contracts 
with Customers and all the related amendments (“new revenue standard”) using the
modified retrospective method. As a policy election, the new revenue standard 
was applied only to contracts that were not substantially completed as of the 
date of adoption. We recognized the cumulative effect of initially applying the 
new revenue standard as an adjustment to the January 1, 2018 opening balance of 
accumulated deficit. The prior period consolidated financial statements have not
been retrospectively adjusted and continue to be reported under the accounting 
standards in effect for those periods.

A majority of our automotive sales revenue is recognized when control transfers 
upon delivery to customers. For certain vehicle sales where revenue was 
previously deferred as an in-substance operating lease, such as certain vehicle 
sales to customers or leasing partners with a resale value guarantee, we 
recognize revenue when the vehicles are delivered as a sale with a right of 
return. As a result, the corresponding operating lease asset, deferred revenue, 
and resale value guarantee balances as of December 31, 2017, were reclassified 
to accumulated deficit as part of our adoption entry. Furthermore, the warranty 
liability related to such vehicles has been accrued as a result of the change 
from in-substance operating leases to vehicle sales. Prepayments on contracts 
that can be cancelled without significant penalties, such as vehicle maintenance
plans, have been reclassified from deferred revenue to customer deposits. Refer 
to the Automotive Sales Revenueand Automotive Leasing Revenuesections below for 
further discussion of the impact on various categories of vehicle sales.

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales Revenue

Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee

Automotive sales revenue includes revenues related to deliveries of new vehicles
and pay-per-use charges, and specific other features and services that meet the 
definition of a performance obligation under the new revenue standard, including
access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, Autopilot, Full 
Self-Driving (“FSD”) features and over-the-air software updates. We recognize 
revenue on automotive sales upon delivery to the customer, which is when the 
control of a vehicle transfers. Payments are typically received at the point 
control transfers or in accordance with payment terms customary to the business.
Other features and services such as access to our Supercharger network, internet
connectivity and over-the-air software updates are provisioned upon control 
transfer of a vehicle and recognized over time on a straight-line basis as we 
have a stand-ready obligation to deliver such services to the customer. We 
recognize revenue related to these other features and services over the 
performance period, which is generally the expected ownership life of the 
vehicle or the eight-year life of the vehicle. Revenue related to Autopilot and 
FSD features is recognized when functionality is delivered to the customer. For 
our obligations related to automotive sales, we estimate standalone selling 
price by considering costs used to develop and deliver the service, third-party 
pricing of similar options and other information that may be available.

At the time of revenue recognition, we reduce the transaction price and record a
sales return reserve against revenue for estimated variable consideration 
related to future product returns. Such estimates are based on historical 
experience and are immaterial in all periods presented. In addition, any fees 
that are paid or payable by us to a customer’s lender when we arrange the 
financing are recognized as an offset against automotive sales revenue.

Costs to obtain a contract mainly relate to commissions paid to our sales 
personnel for the sale of vehicles. Commissions are not paid on other 
obligations suchas access to our Supercharger network, internet connectivity, 
Autopilot, FSD features and over-the-air software updates. As our contract costs
related to automotive sales are typically fulfilled within one year, the costs 
to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred. Amounts billed to customers 
related to shipping and handling are classified as automotive revenue, and we 
have elected to recognize the cost for freight and shipping when control over 
vehicles, parts, or accessories have transferred to the customer as an expense 
in cost of revenues. Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer 
from the transaction price of automotive contracts.

Automotive Sales with Resale Value Guarantee or a Buyback Option

We offer resale value guarantees or similar buy-back terms to certain 
international customers who purchase vehicles and who finance their vehicles 
through one of our specified commercial banking partners. We also offer resale 
value guarantees in connection with automotive sales to certain leasing 
partners. Under these programs, we receive full payment for the vehicle sales 
price at the time of delivery and our counterparty has the option of selling 
their vehicle back to us during the guarantee period, which currently is 
generally at the end of the term of the applicable loan or financing program, 
for a pre-determined resale value.

With the exception of two programs which are discussed within the Automotive 
Leasingsection, we recognize revenue when control transfers upon delivery to 
customersin accordance with the new revenue standardas a sale with a right of 
return as we do not believe the customer has a significant economic incentive to
exercise the resale value guarantee provided to them. The process to determine 
whether there is a significant economic incentive includes a comparison of a 
vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is exercisable with the 
guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s economic incentive to 
exercise. The performance obligations and the pattern of recognizing automotive 
sales with resale value guarantees are consistent with automotive sales without 
resale value guarantees with the exception of our estimate for sales return 
reserve. Sales return reserves for automotive sales with resale value guarantees
are estimated based on historical experience plus consideration for expected 
future market values. On a quarterly basis, we assess the estimated market 
values of vehicles under our buyback options program to determine whether there 
have been changes to the likelihood of future product returns. As we accumulate 
more data related to the buyback values of our vehicles or as market conditions 
change, there may be material changes to their estimated values. Due to price 
adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2019, we estimated that 
there is a greater likelihood that customers will exercise their buyback options
that were provided prior to such adjustments. As a result, along with the 
estimated variable consideration related to normal future product returns for 
vehicles sold under the buyback options program, we adjusted our sales return 
reserve on vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program resulting 
in a reduction of automotive sales revenues of $555 million for the year ended 
December 31, 2019. If customers elect to exercise the buyback option, we expect 
to be able to subsequently resell the returned vehicles, which resulted in a 
corresponding reduction in cost of automotive sales of $451 million for the year
ended December 31, 2019. The net impact was $104 million reduction in gross 
profit for the year ended December 31, 2019. The total sales return reserve on 
vehicles previously sold under our buyback options program was $639 million as 
of December 31, 2019, of which $93 million was short term. The two programs that
are still being recorded as operating leases are discussed in further detail 
below in Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a 
Buyback Optionand Vehicle Sales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where
Exercise is Probable.

Prior to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all transactions with resale 
value guarantees were recorded as operating leases. The amount of sale proceeds 
equal to the resale value guarantee was deferred until the guarantee expired or 
was exercised. For certain transactions that were considered interest bearing 
collateralized borrowings as required under ASC 840, Leases prior to January 1, 
2019, we also accrued interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The 
remaining sale proceeds were deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis 
over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing revenue. The guarantee 
period expired at the earlier of the end of the guarantee period or the pay-off 
of the initial loan. We capitalized the cost of these vehicles on the 
consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and depreciated 
their value, less estimated residual value, to cost of automotive leasing 
revenue over the same period.

In cases where our counterparty retained ownership of the vehicle at the end of 
the guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining 
deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle were settled to automotive 
leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle was expensed to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue. If our counterparty returned the vehicle to 
us during the guarantee period, we purchased the vehicle from our counterparty 
in an amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settled any remaining 
deferred balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassified the net 
book value of the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheet to used vehicle 
inventory.

Deferred revenue activity related to the access to our Supercharger network, 
internet connectivity, Autopilot, FSD features and over-the-air software updates
on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantee consisted of the 
following (in millions):

Deferred revenue is equivalent to the total transaction price allocated to the 
performance obligations that are unsatisfied, or partially unsatisfied, as of 
December 31, 2019. From the deferred revenue balance as of December 31, 2018, 
revenue recognized during the year ended December 31, 2019 was $220 million. 
From the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018, revenue recognized 
during the year ended December 31, 2018 was $81 million. Of the total deferred 
revenue on automotive sales with and without resale value guarantees as of 
December 31, 2019, we expect to recognize $751 million of revenue in the next 12
months. The remaining balance will be recognized over the performance period as 
discussed above in Automotive Sales without Resale Value Guarantee.

Automotive Regulatory Credits

In connection with the production and delivery of our zero emission vehicles in 
global markets, we have earned and will continue to earn various tradable 
automotive regulatory credits. We have sold these credits, and will continue to 
sell future credits, to automotive companies and other regulated entities who 
can use the credits to comply with emission standards and other regulatory 
requirements. For example, under California’s Zero Emission Vehicle Regulation 
and those of states that have adopted California’s standard, vehicle 
manufacturers are required to earn or purchase credits, referred to as ZEV 
credits, for compliance with their annual regulatory requirements. These laws 
provide that automakers may bank or sell to other regulated parties their excess
credits if they earn more credits than the minimum quantity required by those 
laws. We also earn other types of saleable regulatory credits in the United 
States and abroad, including greenhouse gas, fuel economy and clean fuels 
credits. Payments for regulatory credits are typically received at the point 
control transfers to the customer, or in accordance with payment terms customary
to the business.

We recognize revenue on the sale of automotive regulatory credits at the time 
control of the regulatory credits is transferred to the purchasing party as 
automotive revenue in the consolidated statements of operations. Revenue from 
the sale of automotive regulatory credits totaled $594 million, $419 million and
$360 million for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively.
Deferred revenue related to sales of automotive regulatory credits was $140 
million and $0 as ofDecember 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively. We expect to 
recognize the deferred revenue as of December 31, 2019 in the next 12 months.

Automotive Leasing Revenue

Automotive leasing revenue includes revenue recognized under lease accounting 
guidance for our direct leasing programs as well as the two programs with resale
value guarantees which continue to qualify for operating lease treatment. Prior 
to the adoption of the new revenue standard, all programs with resale value 
guarantees were accounted for as operating leases.

Direct Vehicle Leasing Program

We have outstanding leases under our direct vehicle leasing programs in the U. 
S., Canada and in certain countries in Europe. As of December 31, 2019, the 
direct vehicle leasing program is offered for all new Model S, Model X and Model
3 vehicles in the U. S. and for new Model S and Model X vehicles in Canada. 
Qualifying customers are permitted to lease a vehicle directly from Tesla for up
to 48 months. At the end of the lease term, customers are required to return the
vehicles to us or for Model S and Model X leases, may opt to purchase the 
vehicles for a pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing 
transactions as operating leases. We record leasing revenues toautomotive 
leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the contractual term, and we 
record the depreciation of these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue.
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recognized $532 
million, $393 million and $221 million of direct vehicle leasing revenue, 
respectively. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had deferred $218 million and
$110 million, respectively, of lease-related upfront payments, which will be 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the contractual terms of the individual
leases.

We capitalize shipping costs and initial direct costs such as the incremental 
cost of referral fees and sales commissions from the origination of automotive 
lease agreements as an element of operating lease vehicles, net, and 
subsequently amortize these costs over the term of the related lease agreement. 
Our policy is to exclude taxes collected from a customer from the transaction 
price of automotive contracts. Total capitalized costs were immaterial as of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Vehicle Sales to Leasing Partners with a Resale Value Guarantee and a Buyback 
Option

We offer buyback options in connection with automotive sales with resale value 
guarantees with certain leasing partner sales in the United States. These 
transactions entail a transfer of leases, which we have originated with an 
end-customer, to our leasing partner. As control of the vehicles has not been 
transferred in accordance with the new revenue standard, these transactions were
accounted for as interest bearing collateralized borrowings in accordance with 
ASC 840, Leases, prior to January 1, 2019. Under this program, cash is received 
for the full price of the vehicle and the collateralized borrowing value is 
generally recorded within resale value guarantees and the customer upfront down 
payment is recorded within deferred revenue. We amortize the deferred revenue 
amount to automotive leasing revenue on a straight-line basis over the option 
period and accrue interest expense based on our borrowing rate. The option 
period expires at the earlier of the end of the contractual option period or the
pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize vehicles under this program to 
operating lease vehicles, net, on the consolidated balance sheets, and we record
depreciation from these vehicles to cost of automotive leasing revenue during 
the period the vehicle is under a lease arrangement. Cash received for these 
vehicles, net of revenue recognized during the period, is classified as 
collateralized lease (repayments) borrowings within cash flows from financing 
activities in the consolidated statements of cash flows. Following the adoption 
of ASC 842 on January 1, 2019, all new agreements under this program are 
accounted for as operating leases and there was no material change in the timing
and amount of revenue recognized over the term. Consequently, any cash flows for
new agreements are classified as operating cash activities on the consolidated 
statements of cash flows.

At the end of the lease term, we settle our liability in cash by either 
purchasing the vehicle from the leasing partner for the buyback option amount or
paying a shortfall to the option amount the leasing partner may realize on the 
sale of the vehicle. Any remaining balances within deferred revenue and resale 
value guarantee will be settled to automotive leasing revenue. The end customers
can extend the lease for a period of up to 6 months. In cases where the leasing 
partner retains ownership of the vehicle after the end of our option period, we 
expense the net value of the leased vehicle to cost of automotive leasing 
revenue. The maximum amount we could be required to pay under this program, 
should we decide to repurchase all vehicles, was$214 million and $480 million as
of December 31, 2019 and 2018, respectively, including $178 million within a 
12-month period from December 31, 2019. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had
$238million and $558 million, respectively, of such borrowings recorded in 
resale value guarantees and $29 million and $93 million, respectively, recorded 
in deferred revenue liability. For the year ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we
recognized $186 million and $332 million, respectively, of leasing revenue 
related to this program. The net carrying amount of operating lease vehicles 
under this program was $190 million and $469 million, respectively, as of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018.

VehicleS ales to Customers with a Resale Value Guarantee where Exercise is 
Probable

For certain international programs where we have offered resale value guarantees
to certain customers who purchased vehicles and where we expect the customer has
a significant economic incentive to exercise the resale value guarantee provided
to them, we continue to recognize these transactions as operating leases. The 
process to determine whether there is a significant economic incentive includes 
a comparison of a vehicle’s estimated market value at the time the option is 
exercisable with the guaranteed resale value to determine the customer’s 
economic incentive to exercise. We have not sold any vehicles under this program
since the first half of 2017 and all current period activity relates to the 
exercise or cancellation of active transactions. The amount of sale proceeds 
equal to the resale value guarantee is deferred until the guarantee expires or 
is exercised. The remaining sale proceeds are deferred and recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the stated guarantee period to automotive leasing 
revenue. The guarantee period expires at the earlier of the end of the guarantee
period or the pay-off of the initial loan. We capitalize the cost of these 
vehicles on the consolidated balance sheet as operating lease vehicles, net, and
depreciate their value, less salvage value, to cost of automotive leasing 
revenue over the same period.

In cases where a customer retains ownership of a vehicle at the end of the 
guarantee period, the resale value guarantee liability and any remaining 
deferred revenue balances related to the vehicle are settled to automotive 
leasing revenue, and the net book value of the leased vehicle is expensed to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue. If a customer returns the vehicle to us 
during the guarantee period, we purchase the vehicle from the customer in an 
amount equal to the resale value guarantee and settle any remaining deferred 
balances to automotive leasing revenue, and we reclassify the net book value of 
the vehicle on the consolidated balance sheets to used vehicle inventory. As of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018, $115 million and $150 million, respectively, of the 
guarantees were exercisable by customers within the next 12 months. For the year
ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we recognized $150 million and $158 million, 
respectively, of leasing revenue related to this program. The net carrying 
amount of operating lease vehicles under this program was $83 million and $212 
million, respectively, as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Services and Other Revenue

Services and other revenue consists of non-warranty after-sales vehicle 
services, sales of used vehicles, retail merchandise, sales by our acquired 
subsidiaries to third party customers, and vehicle insurance revenue. There were
no significant changes to the timing or amount of revenue recognition as a 
result of our adoption of the new revenue standard.

Revenues related to repair and maintenance services are recognized over time as 
services are provided and extended service plans are recognized over the 
performance period of the service contract as the obligation represents a 
stand-ready obligation to the customer. We sell used vehicles, services, service
plans, vehicle components and merchandise separately and thus use standalone 
selling prices as the basis for revenue allocation to the extent that these 
items are sold in transactions with other performance obligations. Payment for 
used vehicles, services, and merchandise are typically received at the point 
when control transfers to the customer or in accordance with payment terms 
customary to the business. Payments received for prepaid plans are refundable 
upon customer cancellation of the related contracts and are included within 
customer deposits on the consolidated balance sheet. Deferred revenue related to
services and other revenue was immaterial as of December 31, 2019 and 2018.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage Sales

Energy generation and storage sales revenue consists of the sale of solar energy
systems and energy storage systems to residential, small commercial, and large 
commercial and utility grade customers. Upon adoption of the new lease standard 
(refer toLeasessection below for details), energy generation and storage sales 
revenue includes agreements for solar energy systems and power purchase 
agreements (“PPAs”) that commence after January 1, 2019, as these are now 
accounted for under the new revenue standard. Sales of solar energy systems to 
residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the engineering, 
design, and installation of the system. Post installation, residential and small
scale commercial customers receive a proprietary monitoring system that captures
and displays historical energy generation data. Residential and small scale 
commercial customers pay the full purchase price of the solar energy system 
upfront. Revenue for the design and installation obligation is recognized when 
control transfers, which is when we install a solar energy system and the system
passes inspection by the utility or the authority having jurisdiction. Revenue 
for the monitoring service is recognized ratably as a stand-ready obligation 
over the warranty period of the solar energy system. Sales of energy storage 
systems to residential and small scale commercial customers consist of the 
installation of the energy storage system and revenue is recognized when control
transfers, which is when the product has been delivered or, if we are performing
installation, when installed and commissioned. Payment for such storage systems 
is made upon invoice or in accordance with payment terms customary to the 
business.

For large commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy storage 
system sales which consist of the engineering, design, and installation of the 
system, customers make milestone payments that are consistent with 
contract-specific phases of a project. Revenue from such contracts is recognized
over time using the percentage of completion method based on cost incurred as a 
percentage of total estimated contract costs for energy storage system sales and
as a percentage of total estimated labor hours for solar energy system sales. 
Certain large-scale commercial and utility grade solar energy system and energy 
storage system sales also include operations and maintenance service which are 
negotiated with the design and installation contracts and are thus considered to
be a combined contract with the design and installation service. For certain 
large commercial and utility grade solar energy systems and energy storage 
systems where the percentage of completion method does not apply, revenue is 
recognized when control transfers, which is when the product has been delivered 
to the customer and commissioned for energy storage systems and when the project
has received permission to operate from the utility for solar energy systems. 
Operations and maintenance service revenue is recognized ratably over the 
respective contract term for solar energy system sales and upon delivery of the 
service for energy storage system sales. Customer payments for such services are
usually paid annually or quarterly in advance.

In instances where there are multiple performance obligations in a single 
contract, we allocate the consideration to the various obligations in the 
contract based on the relative standalone selling price method. Standalone 
selling prices are estimated based on estimated costs plus margin or using 
market data for comparable products. Costs incurred on the sale of residential 
installations before the solar energy systems are completed are included as work
in process within inventory in the consolidated balance sheets. However, any 
fees that are paid or payable by us to a solar loan lender would be recognized 
as an offset against revenue. Costs to obtain a contract relate mainly to 
commissions paid to our sales personnel related to the sale of solar energy 
systems and energy storage systems. As our contract costs related to solar 
energy system and energy storage system sales are typically fulfilled within one
year, the costs to obtain a contract are expensed as incurred.

As part of our solar energy system and energy storage system contracts, we may 
provide the customer with performance guarantees that warrant that the 
underlying system will meet or exceed the minimum energy generation or retention
requirements specified in the contract. In certain instances, we may receive a 
bonus payment if the system performs above a specified level. Conversely, if a 
solar energy system or energy storage system does not meet the performance 
guarantee requirements, we may be required to pay liquidated damages. Other 
forms of variable consideration related to our large commercial and utility 
grade solar energy system and energy storage system contracts include variable 
customer payments that will be made based on our energy market participation 
activities. Such guarantees and variable customer payments represent a form of 
variable consideration and are estimated at contract inception at their most 
likely amount and updated at the end of each reporting period as additional 
performance data becomes available. Such estimates are included in the 
transaction price only to the extent that it is probable a significant reversal 
of revenue will not occur.

We record as deferred revenue any non-refundable amounts that are collected from
customers related to fees charged for prepayments and remote monitoring service 
and operations and maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably 
over the respective customer contract term. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 
deferred revenue related to such customer payments amounted to $156 million and 
$149 million, respectively. Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance
as of December 31, 2018 was $41 million for the year ended December 31, 2019. 
Revenue recognized from the deferred revenue balance as of January 1, 2018 was 
$41 million for the year ended December 31, 2018. We have elected the practical 
expedient to omit disclosure of the amount of the transaction price allocated to
remaining performance obligations for energy generation and storage sales with 
an original expected contract length of one year or less and the amount that we 
have the right to invoice when that amount corresponds directly with the value 
of the performance to date. As of December 31, 2019, total transaction price 
allocated to performance obligations that were unsatisfied or partially 
unsatisfied for contracts with an original expected length of more than one year
was $103 million. Of this amount, we expect to recognize $5 million in the next 
12 months and the remaining over a period up to 28 years.

Energy Generation and Storage Leasing

For revenue arrangements where we are the lessor under operating lease 
agreements for energy generation and storage products, we record lease revenue 
from minimum lease payments, including upfront rebates and incentives earned 
from such systems, on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease term, 
assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met. The difference 
between the payments received and the revenue recognized is recorded as deferred
revenue on the consolidated balance sheet.

For solar energy systems where customers purchase electricity from us under PPAs
prior to January 1, 2019, we have determined that these agreements should be 
accounted for as operating leases pursuant to ASC 840. Revenue is recognized 
based on the amount of electricity delivered at rates specified under the 
contracts, assuming all other revenue recognition criteria are met.

We record as deferred revenue any amounts that are collected from customers, 
including lease prepayments, in excess of revenue recognized and operations and 
maintenance service, which is recognized as revenue ratably over the respective 
customer contract term. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, deferred revenue 
related to such customer payments amounted to $226 million and $225 million, 
respectively. Deferred revenue also includes the portion of rebates and 
incentives received from utility companies and various local and state 
government agencies, which is recognized as revenue over the lease term. As of 
December 31, 2019 and December 31, 2018, deferred revenue from rebates and 
incentives amounted to $36 million and $37 million, respectively.

We capitalize initial direct costs from the execution of agreements for solar 
energy systems and PPAs, which include the referral fees and sales commissions, 
as an element of solar energy systems, net, and subsequently amortize these 
costs over the term of the related agreements.

Cost of Revenues

Automotive Segment

Automotive Sales

Cost of automotive sales revenue includes direct parts, material and labor 
costs, manufacturing overhead, including depreciation costs of tooling and 
machinery, shipping and logistic costs, vehicle connectivity costs, allocations 
of electricity and infrastructure costs related to our Supercharger network, and
reserves for estimated warranty expenses. Cost of automotive sales revenues also
includes adjustments to warranty expense and charges to write down the carrying 
value of our inventory when it exceeds its estimated net realizable value and to
provide for obsolete and on-hand inventory in excess of forecasted demand.

Automotive Leasing

Cost of automotive leasing revenue includes primarily the amortization of 
operating lease vehicles over the lease term, as well as warranty expenses 
recognized as incurred. Cost of automotive leasing revenue also includes vehicle
connectivity costs and allocations of electricity and infrastructure costs 
related to our Supercharger network for vehicles under our leasing programs.

Services and Other

Costs of services and other revenue includes costs associated with providing 
non-warranty after-sales services, costs to acquire and certify used vehicles, 
costs for retail merchandise, and costs to provide vehicle insurance. Cost of 
services and other revenue also includes direct parts, material and labor costs,
manufacturing overhead associated with the sales by our acquired subsidiaries to
third party customers.

Energy Generation and Storage Segment

Energy Generation and Storage

Energy generation and storage cost of revenue includes direct and indirect 
material and labor costs, warehouse rent, freight, warranty expense, other 
overhead costs and amortization of certain acquired intangible assets. In 
addition, where arrangements are accounted for as operating leases, the cost of 
revenue is primarily comprised of depreciation of the cost of leased solar 
energy systems, maintenance costs associated with those systems and amortization
of any initial direct costs.

Leases

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02 (“ASC 842”), Leases, to 
require lessees to recognize all leases, with certain exceptions, on the balance
sheet, while recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to 
lease accounting under ASC 840. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-10, 
Codification Improvements to Topic 842, Leases, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted 
Improvements, ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, and ASU 
2019-01, Codification Improvements, to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No.
2016-02. ASC 842 eliminates real estate-specific provisions and modifies certain
aspects of lessor accounting. We adopted ASC 842 as of January 1, 2019 using the
cumulative effect adjustment approach (“adoption of the new lease standard”). In
addition, we elected the package of practical expedients permitted under the 
transition guidance within the new standard, which allowed us to carry forward 
the historical determination of contracts as leases, lease classification and 
not reassess initial direct costs for historical lease arrangements. 
Accordingly, previously reported financial statements, including footnote 
disclosures, have not been recast to reflect the application of the new standard
to all comparative periods presented. The finance lease classification under ASC
842 includes leases previously classified as capital leases under ASC 840.

Agreements for solar energy system leases and PPAs (solar leases) that commence 
after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and were previously accounted for
as operating leases no longer meet the definition of a lease upon the adoption 
of ASC 842 and are instead accounted for in accordance with the revenue 
standard. Under these two types of arrangements, the customer is not responsible
for the design of the energy system but rather approved the energy system 
benefits in terms of energy capacity and production to be received over the 
term. Accordingly, the revenue from solar leases commencing after January 1, 
2019 are now recognized as earned, based on the amount of capacity provided or 
electricity delivered at the contractual billing rates, assuming all other 
revenue recognition criteria have been met. Under the practical expedient 
available under ASC 606-10-55-18, we recognize revenue based on the value of the
service which is consistent with the billing amount.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected 
to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components
together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor 
perspective. From a lessor perspective, the timing and pattern of transfer are 
the same for the non-lease components and associated lease component and, the 
lease component, if accounted for separately, would be classified as an 
operating lease. Additionally, leases previously identified as build-to-suit 
leasing arrangements under legacy lease accounting (ASC 840), were derecognized 
pursuant to the transition guidance provided for build-to-suit leases in ASC 
842. Accordingly, these leases have been reassessed as operating leases as of 
the adoption date under ASC 842, and are included on the consolidated balance 
sheet as of December 31, 2019.

Operating lease assets are included within operating lease right-of-use assets, 
and the corresponding operating lease liabilities are included within accrued 
liabilities and otherfor the current portion, and within other long-term 
liabilities for the long-term portion on our consolidated balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2019. Finance lease assets are included within property, plant and 
equipment, net, and the corresponding finance lease liabilities are included 
within current portion of long-term debt and finance leasesfor the current 
portion, and within l ong-term debt and finance leases, net of current 
portionfor the long-term portion on our consolidated balance sheet as of 
December 31, 2019.

We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance 
sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception 
and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably 
certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement
date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we 
used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at 
adoption date in determining the present value of lease payments.

Adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019 had a material impact on 
our consolidated financial statements. The most significant impacts related to 
the (i) recognition of right-of-use ("ROU") assets of $1.29 billion and lease 
liabilities of $1.24 billion for operating leases on the consolidated balance 
sheet, and (ii) de-recognition of build-to-suit lease assets and liabilities of 
$1.62 billion and $1.74 billion, respectively, with the net impact of $97 
million recorded to accumulated deficit, as of January 1, 2019. We also 
reclassified prepaid expenses and other current asset balances of $142 million 
and deferred rent balance, including tenant improvement allowances, and other 
liability balances of $70 million relating to our existing lease arrangements as
of December 31, 2018, into the ROU asset balance as of January 1, 2019. ROU 
assets represent our right to use an underlying asset for the lease term and 
lease liabilities represent our obligation to make lease payments arising from 
the lease. The standard did not materially impact our consolidated statement of 
operations and consolidated statement of cash flows.

The cumulative effect of the changes made to our consolidated balance sheet as 
of January 1, 2019 for the adoption of the new lease standard wasasfollows (in 
millions):

Research and Development Costs

Research and development costs are expensed as incurred.

Marketing, Promotional and Advertising Costs

Marketing, promotional and advertising costs are expensed as incurred and are 
included as an element of selling, general and administrative expense in the 
consolidated statement of operations. We incurred marketing, promotional and 
advertising costs of $27 million, $32 million and $37 million in the years ended
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively, of which the majority is related
to promotional activities.

Income Taxes

Income taxes are computed using the asset and liability method, under which 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference 
between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities using 
enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected 
to affect taxable income. Valuation allowances are established when necessary to
reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized.

We record liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our 
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe that it is more
likely than not that those positions may not be fully sustained upon review by 
tax authorities. Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax 
benefits are classified as income tax expense.

Comprehensive Income (Loss)

Comprehensive income (loss) is comprised of net income (loss) and other 
comprehensive income (loss). Other comprehensive income(loss) consists of 
unrealized gains and losses on cash flow hedges and foreign currency translation
adjustments that have been excluded from the determination of net income (loss).

Stock-Based Compensation

We recognize compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options, restricted stock units (“RSUs”) and our employee stock 
purchase plan (the “ESPP”). The fair value of stock option awards with only 
service and/or performance conditions and the ESPP is estimated on the grant or 
offering date using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. The fair value of 
RSUs is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our
common stock. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the requisite service period, net of actual forfeitures in the 
period.

For performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is recognized 
over the expected performance achievement period of individual performance 
milestones when the achievement of each individual performance milestone becomes
probable. For performance-based awards with a vesting schedule based entirely on
the attainment of both performance and market conditions, stock-based 
compensation expense associated with each tranche is recognized over the longer 
of (i) the expected achievement period for the operational milestone for such 
tranche and (ii) the expected achievement period for the related market 
capitalization milestone determined on the grant date, beginning at the point in
time when the relevant operational milestone is considered probable of being 
met. If such operational milestone becomes probable any time after the grant 
date, we will recognize a cumulative catch-up expense from the grant date to 
that point in time. If the related market capitalization milestone is achieved 
earlier than its expected achievement period and the achievement of the related 
operational milestone, then the stock-based compensation expense will be 
recognized over the expected achievement period for the operational milestone, 
which may accelerate the rate at which such expense is recognized. The fair 
value of such awards is estimated on the grant date using Monte Carlo 
simulations (see Note14, Equity Incentive Plans).

As we accumulate additional employee stock-based awards data over time and as we
incorporate market data related to our common stock, we may calculate 
significantly different volatilities and expected lives, which could materially 
impact the valuation of our stock-based awards and the stock-based compensation 
expense that we will recognize in future periods. Stock-based compensation 
expense is recorded in cost of revenues, research and development expense and 
selling, general and administrative expense in the consolidated statements of 
operations.

Noncontrolling Interests and Redeemable Noncontrolling Interests

Noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests represent 
third-party interests in the net assets under certain funding arrangements, or 
funds, that we enter into to finance the costs of solar energy systems and 
vehicles under operating leases. We have determined that the contractual 
provisions of the funds represent substantive profit sharing arrangements. We 
have further determined that the appropriate methodology for calculating the 
noncontrolling interest and redeemable noncontrolling interest balances that 
reflects the substantive profit sharing arrangements is a balance sheet approach
using the hypothetical liquidation at book value (“HLBV”) method. We, therefore,
determine the amount of the noncontrolling interests and redeemable 
noncontrolling interests in the net assets of the funds at each balance sheet 
date using the HLBV method, which is presented on the consolidated balance sheet
as noncontrolling interests in subsidiaries and redeemable noncontrolling 
interests in subsidiaries. Under the HLBV method, the amounts reported as 
noncontrolling interests and redeemable noncontrolling interests in the 
consolidated balance sheet represent the amounts the third-parties would 
hypothetically receive at each balance sheet date under the liquidation 
provisions of the funds, assuming the net assets of the funds were liquidated at
their recorded amounts determined in accordance with GAAP and with tax laws 
effective at the balance sheet date and distributed to the third-parties. The 
third-parties’ interests in the results of operations of the funds are 
determined as the difference in the noncontrolling interest and redeemable 
noncontrolling interest balances in the consolidated balance sheets between the 
start and end of each reporting period, after taking into account any capital 
transactions between the funds and the third-parties. However, the redeemable 
noncontrolling interest balance is at least equal to the redemption amount. The 
redeemable noncontrolling interest balance is presented as temporary equity in 
the mezzanine section of the consolidated balance sheet since these 
third-parties have the right to redeem their interests in the funds for cash or 
other assets.

Net Income (Loss) per Share of Common Stock Attributable to Common Stockholders

Basic net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common 
stockholders is calculated by dividing net income (loss) attributable to common 
stockholders by the weighted-average shares of common stock outstanding for the 
period. During the year ended December 31, 2019, we increased net loss 
attributable to common stockholders by $8 million to arrive at the numerator 
used to calculate net loss per share. This adjustment represents the difference 
between the cash we paid to a financing fund investor for their noncontrolling 
interest in one of our subsidiaries and the carrying amount of the 
noncontrolling interest on our consolidated balance sheet, in accordance with 
ASC 260, Earnings per Share. Potentially dilutive shares, which are based on the
weighted-average shares of common stock underlying outstanding stock-based 
awards, warrants and convertible senior notes using the treasury stock method or
the if-converted method, as applicable, are included when calculating diluted 
net income (loss) per share of common stock attributable to common stockholders 
when their effect is dilutive. Since we intend to settle or have settled in cash
the principal outstanding under our 0.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2019, 
1.25% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2021, 2.375% Convertible Senior Notes due 
in 2022, 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes due in 2024 and 5.50% Convertible Senior
Notes due in 2022 (assumed in our Maxwell Technologies, Inc. acquisition), we 
use the treasury stock method when calculating their potential dilutive effect, 
if any. Furthermore, in connection with the offerings of our notes, we entered 
into convertible note hedges and warrants (see Note 12, Debt). However, our 
convertible note hedges are not included when calculating potentially dilutive 
shares since their effect is always anti-dilutive. Warrants which have a strike 
price above our share price were out of the money and have not been included in 
the table below.

The following table presents the potentially dilutive shares that were excluded 
from the computation of diluted net income (loss) per share of common stock 
attributable to common stockholders, because their effect was anti-dilutive (in 
millions):

Business Combinations

We account for business acquisitions under ASC 805, Business Combinations. The 
total purchase consideration for an acquisition is measured as the fair value of
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities assumed at the 
acquisition date. Costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition are 
expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets (including intangible assets), 
liabilities assumed (including contingent liabilities) and noncontrolling 
interests in an acquisition are measured initially at their fair values at the 
acquisition date. We recognize goodwill if the fair value of the total purchase 
consideration and any noncontrolling interests is in excess of the net fair 
value of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. We 
recognize a bargain purchase gain within other income (expense), net, on the 
consolidated statement of operations if the net fair value of the identifiable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed is in excess of the fair value of 
the total purchase consideration and any noncontrolling interests. We include 
the results of operations of the acquired business in the consolidated financial
statements beginning on the acquisition date.

Cash and Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with an original maturity of three months or less 
at the date of purchase are considered cash equivalents. Our cash equivalents 
are primarily comprised of money market funds.

Restricted Cash

We maintain certain cash balances restricted as to withdrawal or use. Our 
restricted cash is comprised primarily of cash as collateral for our sales to 
lease partners with a resale value guarantee, letters of credit, real estate 
leases, insurance policies, credit card borrowing facilities and certain 
operating leases. In addition, restricted cash includes cash received from 
certain fund investors that have not been released for use by us and cash held 
to service certain payments under various secured debt facilities.

The following table totals cash and cash equivalents and restricted cash as 
reported on the consolidated balance sheets; the sums are presented in the 
consolidated statements of cash flows (in millions):

Accounts Receivable and Allowance for DoubtfulAccounts

Accounts receivable primarily include amounts related to receivables from 
financial institutions and leasing companies offering various financing products
to our customers, sales of energy generation and storage products, sales of 
regulatory credits to other automotive manufacturers and maintenance services on
vehicles owned by leasing companies. We provide an allowance against accounts 
receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected. We write-off 
accounts receivable when they are deemed uncollectible.

We typically do not carry significant accounts receivable related to our vehicle
and related sales as customer payments are due prior to vehicle delivery, except
for amounts due from commercial financial institutions for approved financing 
arrangements between our customers and the financial institutions.

MyPower Customer Notes Receivable

We have customer notes receivable under the legacy MyPower loan program. MyPower
was offered by SolarCity to provide residential customers with the option to 
finance the purchase of a solar energy system through a 30-year loan. The 
outstanding balances, net of any allowance for potentially uncollectible 
amounts, are presented on the consolidated balance sheet as a component of 
prepaid expenses and other current assets for the current portion and as MyPower
customer notes receivable, net of current portion, for the long-term portion. In
determining the allowance and credit quality for customer notes receivable, we 
identify significant customers with known disputes or collection issues and also
consider our historical level of credit losses and current economic trends that 
might impact the level of future credit losses. Customer notes receivable that 
are individually impaired are charged-off as a write-off of the allowance for 
losses. Since acquisition, there have been no new significant customers with 
known disputes or collection issues, and the amount of potentially uncollectible
amounts has been insignificant. In addition, there were no material non-accrual 
or past due customer notes receivable as of December 31, 2019.

Concentration of Risk

Credit Risk

Financial instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of credit 
risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, restricted cash, accounts receivable, 
convertible note hedges, and interest rate swaps. Our cash balances are 
primarily invested in money market funds or on deposit at high credit quality 
financial institutions in the U. S. These deposits are typically in excess of 
insured limits. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, no entity represented 10% or 
more of our total accounts receivable balance. The risk of concentration for our
interest rate swaps is mitigated by transacting with several highly-rated 
multinational banks.

Supply Risk

We are dependent on our suppliers, the majority of which are single source 
suppliers, and the inability of these suppliers to deliver necessary components 
of our products in a timely manner at prices, quality levels and volumes 
acceptable to us, or our inability to efficiently manage these components from 
these suppliers, could have a material adverse effect on our business, 
prospects, financial condition and operating results.

Inventory Valuation

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or net realizable value. Cost is 
computed using standard cost for vehicles and energy storage products, which 
approximates actual cost on a first-in, first-out basis. In addition, cost for 
solar energy systems is recorded using actual cost. We record inventory 
write-downs for excess or obsolete inventories based upon assumptions about 
current and future demand forecasts. If our inventory on-hand is in excess of 
our future demand forecast, the excess amounts are written-off.

We also review our inventory to determine whether its carrying value exceeds the
net amount realizable upon the ultimate sale of the inventory. This requires us 
to determine the estimated selling price of our vehicles less the estimated cost
to convert the inventory on-hand into a finished product. Once inventory is 
written-down, a new, lower cost basis for that inventory is established and 
subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in the restoration 
or increase in that newly established cost basis.

Should our estimates of future selling prices or production costs change, 
additional and potentially material increases to this reserve may be required. A
small change in our estimates may result in a material charge to our reported 
financial results.

Operating Lease Vehicles

Vehicles that are leased as part of our direct vehicle leasing program, vehicles
delivered to leasing partners with a resale value guarantee and a buyback 
option, and vehicles delivered to customers with resale value guarantee where 
exercise is probable are classified as operating lease vehicles as the related 
revenue transactions are treated as operating leases under ASC 842 ( refer to 
the Automotive Leasing Revenue section above for details). Operating lease 
vehicles are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation. We generally 
depreciate their value, less salvage value, using the straight-line-method to 
cost of automotive leasing revenue over the contractual period. The total cost 
of operating lease vehicles recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of 
December 31, 2019 and 2018 was $2.85 billion and $2.55 billion, respectively. 
Accumulated depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31, 2019 and 
2018 was $406 million and $458 million, respectively.

Solar Energy Systems, Net

We are the lessor of solar energy systems. Prior to January 1, 2019, these 
leases were accounted for as operating leases in accordance with ASC 840. Under 
ASC 840, to determine lease classification, we evaluated the lease terms to 
determine whether there was a transfer of ownership or bargain purchase option 
at the end of the lease, whether the lease term was greater than 75% of the 
useful life or whether the present value of the minimum lease payments exceeded 
90% of the fair value at lease inception. As discussed in the Leasessection 
above, agreements for solar energy system leases and PPAs that commence after 
January 1, 2019 no longer meet the definition of a lease upon the adoption of 
ASC 842 and are instead accounted for in accordance with the new revenue 
standard. We utilize periodic appraisals to estimate useful lives and fair 
values at lease inception and residual values at lease termination. Solar energy
systems are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.

Depreciation and amortization is calculated using the straight-line method over 
the estimated useful lives of the respective assets, as follows:

  Solar energy systems in service               30 to 35 years               
  Initial direct costs related to customer      Lease term (up to 25 years)  

Solar energy systems pending interconnection will be depreciated as solar energy
systems in service when they have been interconnected and placed in-service. 
Solar energy systems under construction represents systems that are under 
installation, which will be depreciated as solar energy systems in service when 
they are completed, interconnected and placed in service. Initial direct costs 
related to customer solar energy system agreement acquisition costs are 
capitalized and amortized over the term of the related customer agreements.

Property, Plant and Equipment, net

Property, plant and equipment, net, including leasehold improvements, are 
recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is generally 
computed using the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the 
respective assets, as follows:

  Machinery, equipment, vehicles and      2 to 12 years   
  Building and building improvements      15 to 30 years  
  Computer equipment and software         3 to 10 years   

Leasehold improvements are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the shorter
of their estimated useful lives or the terms of the related leases.

Upon the retirement or sale of our property, plant and equipment, the cost and 
associated accumulated depreciation are removed from the consolidated balance 
sheet, and the resulting gain or loss is reflected on the consolidated statement
of operations. Maintenance and repair expenditures are expensed as incurred 
while major improvements that increase the functionality, output or expected 
life of an asset are capitalized and depreciated ratably over the identified 
useful life.

Interest expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of 
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on 
construction-in-progress is included within property, plant and equipment and is
amortized over the life of the related assets.

Prior to the adoption of the new lease standard, we were deemed to be the owner,
for accounting purposes, during the construction phase of certain long-lived 
assets under build-to-suit lease arrangements because of our involvement with 
the construction, our exposure to any potential cost overruns or our other 
commitments under the arrangements. In accordance with ASC 840, we recognized 
build-to-suit lease assets under construction and corresponding build-to-suit 
lease liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet. Once construction was 
completed, if a lease met certain “sale-leaseback” criteria, we removed the 
asset and liability and accounted for the lease as an operating lease. 
Otherwise, the lease was accounted for as a capital lease. As a result of the 
adoption of the new lease standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all
build-to-suit lease assets and have reassessed these leases to be operating 
lease right-of-use assets within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 
31, 2019 (refer to Leases section above for details).

Long-Lived Assets Including Acquired Intangible Assets

We review our property, plant and equipment, long-term prepayments and 
intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount of an asset (or asset group) may not be 
recoverable. We measure recoverability by comparing the carrying amount to the 
future undiscounted cash flows that the asset is expected to generate. If the 
asset is not recoverable, its carrying amount would be adjusted-down to its fair
value. For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we have recognized 
certain impairments of our long-lived assets (refer to Note 4, Goodwill and 
Intangible Assetsand Note 22, Restructuring and Other, for further details). For
the year ended December 31, 2017, we have recognized no material impairments of 
our long-lived assets.

Intangible assets with definite lives are amortized on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which range from one to thirty years.

Goodwill

We assess goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter, or more 
frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it might be 
impaired, by comparing its carrying value to the reporting unit’s fair value. 
For the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018, and 2017, we had not recognized any
impairment of goodwill.

Capitalization of Software Costs

For costs incurred in development of internal use software, we capitalize costs 
incurred during the application development stage. Costs related to preliminary 
project activities and post-implementation activities are expensed as incurred. 
Internal use software is amortized on a straight-line basis over its estimated 
useful life of three to ten years. We evaluate the useful lives of these assets 
on an annual basis, and we test for impairment whenever events or changes in 
circumstances occur that could impact the recoverability of these assets.

Foreign Currency

We determine the functional and reporting currency of each of our international 
subsidiaries and their operating divisions based on the primary currency in 
which they operate. In cases where the functional currency is not the U. S. 
dollar, we recognize a cumulative translation adjustment created by the 
different rates we apply to accumulated deficits, including current period 
income or loss and the balance sheet. For each subsidiary, we apply the monthly 
average functional exchange rate to its monthly income or loss and the month-end
functional currency rate to translate the balance sheet.

Foreign currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of 
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies other than the 
functional currency. Transaction gains and losses are recognized in other income
(expense), net, in the consolidated statements of operations. For the years 
ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, we recorded foreign currency transaction
gains of $48 million, gains of $2 million and losses of $52 million, 
respectively.

Warranties

We provide a manufacturer’s warranty on all new and used vehicles and production
powertrain components and systems we sell. In addition, we also provide a 
warranty on the installation and components of the energy generation and storage
systems we sell for periods typically between 10 to 25 years. We accrue a 
warranty reserve for the products sold by us, which includes our best estimate 
of the projected costs to repair or replace items under warranties and recalls 
when identified. These estimates are based on actual claims incurred to date and
an estimate of the nature, frequency and costs of future claims. These estimates
are inherently uncertain given our relatively short history of sales, and 
changes to our historical or projected warranty experience may cause material 
changes to the warranty reserve in the future. The warranty reserve does not 
include projected warranty costs associated with our vehicles subject to lease 
accounting and our solar energy systems under lease contracts or PPAs, as the 
costs to repair these warranty claims are expensed as incurred. The portion of 
the warranty reserve expected to be incurred within the next 12 months is 
included within accrued liabilities and other, while the remaining balance is 
included within other long-term liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets. 
Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in the 
consolidated statements of operations. Due to the magnitude of our automotive 
business, accrued warranty balance as of December 31, 2019 was primarily related
to our automotive segment. Accrued warranty activity consisted of the following 
(in millions):

                                                                       Year

For the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, and 2017, warranty costs 
incurred for vehicles accounted for as operating leases were $20 million, $22 
million and $36 million, respectively.

Solar Renewable Energy Credits

We account for solar renewable energy credits (“SRECs”) when they are purchased 
by us or sold to third-parties. For SRECs generated by solar energy systems 
owned by us and minted by government agencies, we do not recognize any 
specifically identifiable costs as there are no specific incremental costs 
incurred to generate the SRECs. We recognize revenue within the energy 
generation and storage segment from the sale of an SREC when the SREC is 
transferred to the buyer, and the cost of the SREC, if any, is then recorded to 
energy generation and storage cost of revenue.

Deferred Investment Tax Credit Revenue

We have solar energy systems that are eligible for ITCs that accrue to eligible 
property under the Internal Revenue Code (“IRC”). Under Section 50(d)(5) of the 
IRC and the related regulations, a lessor of qualifying property may elect to 
treat the lessee as the owner of such property for the purposes of claiming the 
ITCs associated with such property. These regulations enable the ITCs to be 
separated from the ownership of the property and allow the transfer of the ITCs.
Under our lease pass-through fund arrangements, we can make a tax election to 
pass-through the ITCs to the investors, who are the legal lessee of the 
property. Therefore, we are able to monetize these ITCs to the investors who can
utilize them in return for cash payments. We consider the monetization of ITCs 
to constitute one of the key elements of realizing the value associated with 
solar energy systems. Consequently, we consider the proceeds from the 
monetization of ITCs to be a component of revenue generated from solar energy 
systems.

Under the new revenue standard, we recognize revenue upon the delivery of ITCs 
to investors under our lease pass-through fund arrangements as this is the point
in time that control of ITCs has transferred.

We indemnify the investors for any recapture of ITCs due to our non-compliance. 
We have concluded that the likelihood of a recapture event is remote, and 
consequently, we have not recognized a liability for this indemnification on the
consolidated balance sheets.

Nevada Tax Incentives

We had entered into agreements with the State of Nevada and Storey County in 
Nevada that provide abatements for sales, use, real property, personal property 
and employer excise taxes, discounts to the base tariff energy rates and 
transferable tax credits. These incentives are available for the applicable 
periods beginning on October 17, 2014 and ending on either June 30, 2024 or June
30, 2034 (depending on the incentive). Under these agreements, we were eligible 
for a maximum of $195 million of transferable tax credits, subject to capital 
investments by us and our partners for Gigafactory Nevada of at least $3.50 
billion, which we exceeded during 2017, and specified hiring targets for 
Gigafactory Nevada, which we exceeded during 2018. We recorded these credits as 
earned when we had evidence there was a market for their sale. Credits were 
applied as a cost offset to either employee expense or to capital assets, 
depending on the source of the credits. Credits earned from employee hires or 
capital spending by our partners at Gigafactory Nevada were recorded as a 
reduction to operating expenses. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018, we had earned
the maximum of $195 million of transferable tax credits under these agreements.

Recent Accounting Pronouncements

Recently issued accounting pronouncements not yet adopted

In June 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-13, Measurement of Credit Losses on 
Financial Instruments, to require financial assets carried at amortized cost to 
be presented at the net amount expected to be collected based on historical 
experience, current conditions and forecasts. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU 
No. 2018-19, Codification Improvements to Topic 326, to clarify that receivables
arising from operating leases are within the scope of lease accounting 
standards. Further, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-04, ASU No. 2019-05, ASU 
2019-10 and ASU 2019-11 to provide additional guidance on the credit losses 
standard. The ASUs are effective for interim and annual periods beginning after 
December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASUs is on a 
modified retrospective basis. We plan to adopt the ASUs on January 1, 2020. The 
ASUs are currently not expected to have a material impact on our consolidated 
financial statements.

In January 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-04, Simplifying the Test for 
Goodwill Impairment, to simplify the test for goodwill impairment by removing 
Step 2. An entity will, therefore, perform the goodwill impairment test by 
comparing the fair value of a reporting unit with its carrying amount and 
recognizing an impairment charge for the amount by which the carrying amount 
exceeds the fair value, not to exceed the total amount of goodwill allocated to 
the reporting unit. An entity still has the option to perform a qualitative 
assessment to determine if the quantitative impairment test is necessary. The 
ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning after December 15, 
2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is prospective. We plan
to adopt the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not 
expected to have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements.

In August 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-15, Customer’s Accounting for 
Implementation Costs Incurred in a Cloud Computing Arrangement that Is a Service
Contract. The ASU aligns the requirements for capitalizing implementation costs 
incurred in a hosting arrangement that is a service contract with the 
requirements for capitalizing implementation costs incurred to develop or obtain
internal-use software (and hosting arrangements that include an internal-use 
software license). The ASU is effective for interim and annual periods beginning
after December 15, 2019, with early adoption permitted. Adoption of the ASU is 
either retrospective or prospective. We plan to adopt the ASU prospectively on 
January 1, 2020. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact on 
our consolidated financial statements.

In December 2019, the FASB issued ASU No. 2019-12, Simplifying the Accounting 
for Income Taxes, as part of its initiative to reduce complexity in accounting 
standards. The amendments in the ASU are effective for fiscal years beginning 
after December 15, 2020, including interim periods therein. Early adoption of 
the standard is permitted, including adoption in interim or annual periods for 
which financial statements have not yet been issued. We have not early adopted 
this ASU for 2019. The ASU is currently not expected to have a material impact 
on our consolidated financial statements.

Recently adopted accounting pronouncements

In February 2016, the FASB issued ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, to require lessees to
recognize all leases, with limited exceptions, on the balance sheet, while 
recognition on the statement of operations will remain similar to legacy lease 
accounting, ASC 840. The ASU also eliminates real estate-specific provisions and
modifies certain aspects of lessor accounting. Subsequently, the FASB issued ASU
No. 2018-10, Codification Improvements to Topic 842, ASU No. 2018-11, Targeted 
Improvements, ASU No. 2018-20, Narrow-Scope Improvements for Lessors, and ASU 
2019-01, Codification Improvements, to clarify and amend the guidance in ASU No.
2016-02. We adopted the ASUs on January 1, 2019 on a modified retrospective 
basis through a cumulative adjustment to our beginning accumulated deficit 
balance. Prior comparative periods have not been recast under this method, and 
we adopted all available practical expedients, as applicable. Further, solar 
leases that commence on or after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and 
which were accounted for as leases under ASC 840, will no longer meet the 
definition of a lease. Instead, solar leases commencing on or after January 1, 
2019 will be accounted for under the new revenue standard. In addition to 
recognizing operating leases that were previously not recognized on the 
consolidated balance sheet, our build-to-suit leases were also de-recognized 
with a net decrease of approximately $97 million to our beginning accumulated 
deficit after income tax effects, as our build-to-suit leases no longer qualify 
for build-to-suit accounting and are instead recognized as operating leases. 
Upon adoption, our consolidated balance sheet include an overall reduction in 
assets of $473 million and a reduction in liabilities of $570 million. The 
adoption of the ASUs did not have a material impact on the consolidated 
statement of operations or the consolidated statement of cash flows.

In August 2017, the FASB issued ASU No. 2017-12, Targeted Improvements to 
Accounting for Hedging Activities, to simplify the application of current hedge 
accounting guidance. The ASU expands and refines hedge accounting for both 
non-financial and financial risk components and aligns the recognition and 
presentation of the effects of the hedging instrument and the hedged item in the
financial statements. We adopted the ASU prospectively on January 1, 2019, and 
the ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements.

In January 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-01, Land Easement Practical 
Expedient Transition to Topic 842, to permit an entity to elect a practical 
expedient to not re-evaluate land easements that existed or expired before the 
entity’s adoption of ASU No. 2016-02, Leases, and that were not accounted for as
leases. The ASU did not have a material impact on the consolidated financial 
statements.
