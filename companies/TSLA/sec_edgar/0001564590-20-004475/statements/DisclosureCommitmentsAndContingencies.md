Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

We have an operating lease through the Research Foundation for the State 
University of New York (the “SUNY Foundation”) for a manufacturing facility 
constructed on behalf of the SUNY Foundation and which was substantially 
completed in April 2018. We use this facility, referred to as GigafactoryNew 
York, primarily for the development and production of our Solar Roof and other 
solar products and components, energy storage components, and Supercharger 
components, and for other lessor-approved functions. Under the lease and a 
related research and development agreement, on behalf of the SUNY Foundation, we
have and will continue to install certain utilities and other improvements and 
acquire certain equipment designated by us to be used in the manufacturing 
facility. The SUNY Foundation covered (i) construction costs related to the 
manufacturing facility up to $350 million, (ii) the acquisition and 
commissioning of the manufacturing equipment in an amount up to $275 million and
(iii) $125 million for additional specified scope costs, in cases (i) and (ii) 
only, subject to the maximum funding allocation from the State of New York; and 
we were responsible for any construction or equipment costs in excess of such 
amounts. The SUNY Foundation owns the manufacturing facility and the 
manufacturing equipment purchased by the SUNY Foundation. Following completion 
of the manufacturing facility, we have commenced leasing of the manufacturing 
facility and the manufacturing equipment owned by the SUNY Foundation for an 
initial period of 10 years, with an option to renew, for $2.00 per year plus 
utilities. Following the adoption of ASC 842, we no longer recognize the 
build-to-suit asset and related depreciation expense or the corresponding 
financing liability and related amortization for Gigafactory New York in our 
consolidated financial statements.

Under the terms of the operating lease arrangement, we are required to achieve 
specific operational milestones during the initial lease term; which include 
employing a certain number of employees at the manufacturing facility, within 
western New York and within the State of New York within specified periods 
following the completion of the manufacturing facility. We are also required to 
spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses and other
costs in the State of New York within 10 years following the achievement of full
production. On an annual basis during the initial lease term, as measured on 
each anniversary of the commissioning of the manufacturing facility, if we fail 
to meet these specified investment and job creation requirements, then we would 
be obligated to pay a $41 million “program payment” to the SUNY Foundation for 
each year that we fail to meet these requirements. Furthermore, if the 
arrangement is terminated due to a material breach by us, then additional 
amounts might become payable by us. As of December 31, 2019, we have met the 
targets as of the applicable measurement dates and anticipate meeting the 
remaining obligations through our operations at this facility and other 
operations within the State of New York.

Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China

We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the 
local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we are constructing 
Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to 
spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures, and to generate RMB 2.23 
billion of annual tax revenues starting at the end of 2023. If we are unwilling 
or unable to meet such target or obtain periodic project approvals, in 
accordance with the Chinese government’s standard terms for such arrangements, 
we would be required to revert the site to the local government and receive 
compensation for the remaining value of the land lease, buildings and fixtures. 
We believe the capital expenditure requirement and the tax revenue target will 
be attainable even if our actual vehicle production was far lower than the 
volumes we are forecasting.

Legal Proceedings

Securities Litigation Relating to the SolarCity Acquisition

Between September 1, 2016 and October 5, 2016, seven lawsuits were filed in the 
Delaware Court of Chancery by purported stockholders of Tesla challenging our 
acquisition of SolarCity. Following consolidation, the lawsuit names as 
defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted and 
alleges, among other things, that board members breached their fiduciary duties 
in connection with the acquisition. The complaint asserts both derivative claims
and direct claims on behalf of a purported class and seeks, among other relief, 
unspecified monetary damages, attorneys’ fees, and costs. OnJanuary27, 2017, 
defendants filed a motion to dismiss the operative complaint. Rather than 
respond to the defendants’ motion, the plaintiffs filed an amended complaint. On
March17, 2017, defendants filed a motion to dismiss the amended complaint. On 
December13, 2017, the Court heard oral argument on the motion. On March28, 2018,
the Court denied defendants’ motion to dismiss. Defendants filed a request for 
interlocutory appeal, but the Delaware Supreme Court denied that request without
ruling on the merits but electing not to hear an appeal at this early stage of 
the case. Defendants filed their answer on May 18, 2018, and mediations were 
held on June 10, 2019. Plaintiffs and defendants filed respective motions for 
summary judgment on August 25, 2019, and further mediations were held on October
3, 2019. The Court held a hearing on the motions for summary judgment on 
November 4, 2019. On January 22, 2020, all of the director defendants except 
Elon Musk reached a tentative settlement to resolve the lawsuit against them for
an amount that would be paid entirely under the applicable insurance policy. The
settlement does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any party. Tesla 
will receive such amount, which would be recognized as a gain in its financial 
statements, if the settlement is finally approved by the Court. On February 4, 
2020, the Court issued a ruling that denied plaintiffs’ previously-filed motion 
and granted in part and denied in part defendants’ previously-filed motion. Fact
and expert discovery is complete, and the case is set for trial in March 2020.

These plaintiffs and others filed parallel actions in the U. S. District Court 
for the District of Delaware on or about April21, 2017. They include claims for 
violations of the federal securities laws and breach of fiduciary duties by 
Tesla’s board of directors. Those actions have been consolidated and stayed 
pending the above-referenced Chancery Court litigation.

We believe that claims challenging the SolarCity acquisition are without merit 
and intend to defend against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the 
possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims.

Securities Litigation Relating to Production of Model 3 Vehicles

OnOctober10, 2017, a purported stockholder class action was filed in the U. S. 
District Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, two of its
current officers, and a former officer. The complaint alleges violations of 
federal securities laws and seeks unspecified compensatory damages and other 
relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla securities from 
May4, 2016 to October6, 2017. The lawsuit claims that Tesla supposedly made 
materially false and misleading statements regarding the Company’s preparedness 
to produce Model 3 vehicles. Plaintiffs filed an amended complaint on March23, 
2018, and defendants filed a motion to dismiss on May25, 2018. The court granted
defendants’ motion to dismiss with leave to amend. Plaintiffs filed their 
amended complaint on September 28, 2018, and defendants filed a motion to 
dismiss the amended complaint on February 15, 2019. The hearing on the motion to
dismiss was held on March 22, 2019, and on March 25, 2019, the Court ruled in 
favor of defendants and dismissed the complaint with prejudice. On April 8, 
2019, plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal and on July 17, 2019 filed their 
opening brief. We filed our opposition on September 16, 2019. We continue to 
believe that the claims are without merit and intend to defend against this 
lawsuit vigorously. We are unable to estimate the possible loss or range of 
loss, if any, associated with this lawsuit.

On October 26, 2018, in a similar action, a purported stockholder class action 
was filed in the Superior Court of California in Santa Clara County against 
Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial purchasers in an offering of debt securities 
by Tesla in August 2017. The complaint alleges misrepresentations made by Tesla 
regarding the number of Model 3 vehicles Tesla expected to produce by the end of
2017 in connection with such offering and seeks unspecified compensatory damages
and other relief on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla 
securities in such offering. Tesla thereafter removed the case to federal court.
On January 22, 2019, plaintiff abandoned its effort to proceed in state court, 
instead filing an amended complaint against Tesla, Elon Musk and seven initial 
purchasers in the debt offering before the same judge in the U. S. District 
Court for the Northern District of California who is hearing the 
above-referenced earlier filed federal case. On February 5, 2019, the Court 
stayed this new case pending a ruling on the motion to dismiss the complaint in 
such earlier filed federal case. After such earlier filed federal case was 
dismissed, defendants filed a motion on July 2, 2019 to dismiss this case as 
well. This case is now stayed pending a ruling from the appellate court on such 
earlier filed federal case with an agreement that if defendants prevail on 
appeal in such case, this case will be dismissed. We believe that the claims are
without merit and intend to defend against this lawsuit vigorously. We are 
unable to estimate the possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with 
this lawsuit.

Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award

On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and 
derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the 
members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate 
waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary 
duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan. The complaint seeks, 
among other things, monetary damages and rescission or reformation of the 
stock-based compensation plan. On August 31, 2018, defendants filed a motion to 
dismiss the complaint; plaintiff filed its opposition brief on November 1, 2018 
and defendants filed a reply brief on December 13, 2018. The hearing on the 
motion to dismiss was held on May 9, 2019. On September 20, 2019, the Court 
granted the motion to dismiss as to the corporate waste claim but denied the 
motion as to the breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment claims. Our 
answer was filed on December 3, 2019, and trial is set for June 2021. We believe
the claims asserted in this lawsuit are without merit and intend to defend 
against them vigorously.

Securities Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction

Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class 
actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Elon Musk’s 
August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. All of
the suits are now pending in the U. S. District Court for the Northern District 
of California. Although the complaints vary in certain respects, they each 
purport to assert claims for violations of federal securities laws related to 
Mr. Musk’s statement and seek unspecified compensatory damages and other relief 
on behalf of a purported class of purchasers of Tesla’s securities. Plaintiffs 
filed their consolidated complaint on January 16, 2019 and added as defendants 
the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The now-consolidated purported 
stockholder class action was stayed while the issue of selection of lead counsel
was briefed and argued before the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit. 
The Ninth Circuit ruled regarding lead counsel. Defendants filed a motion to 
dismiss the complaint on November 22, 2019. The hearing on the motion is set for
March 6, 2020. We believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend 
against them vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss, or range 
of loss, associated with these claims.

Between October 17, 2018 and November 9, 2018, five derivative lawsuits were 
filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Mr. Musk and the members of 
Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted in relation to statements made 
and actions connected to a potential going private transaction. In addition to 
these cases, on October 25, 2018, another derivative lawsuit was filed in the U.
S. District Court for the District of Delaware against Mr. Musk and the members 
of the Tesla board of directors as then constituted. The Courts in both the 
Delaware federal court and Delaware Court of Chancery actions have consolidated 
their respective actions and stayed each consolidated action pending resolution 
of the above-referenced consolidated purported stockholder class action. We 
believe that the claims have no merit and intend to defend against them 
vigorously. We are unable to estimate the potential loss, or range of loss, 
associated with these claims.

On March 7, 2019, various stockholders filed a derivative suit in the Delaware 
Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of the Company, naming Elon Musk and 
Tesla’s board of directors, also related to Mr. Musk’s August 7, 2018 Twitter 
post that is the basis of the above-referenced consolidated purported 
stockholder class action as well as Mr. Musk’s February 19, 2019 Twitter post 
regarding Tesla’s vehicle production. The suit asserts claims for breach of 
fiduciary duty and seeks declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages,
and other relief. Plaintiffs moved for expedited proceedings in connection with 
the declaratory and injunctive relief. Briefs were filed on March 13, 2019 and 
the hearing held on March 18, 2019. Defendants prevailed, with the Court denying
plaintiffs’ request for an expedited trial and granting defendants’ request to 
stay this action pending the outcome of the above-referenced consolidated 
purported stockholder class action.

Settlement with SEC related to Potential Going Private Transaction

On October 16, 2018, the U. S. District Court for the Southern District of New 
York entered a final judgment approving the terms of a settlement filed with the
Court on September 29, 2018, in connection with the actions taken by the U. S. 
Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) relating to Elon Musk’s prior 
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private. Without admitting or 
denying any of the SEC’s allegations, and with no restriction on Mr. Musk’s 
ability to serve as an officer or director on the Board (other than as its 
Chair), among other things, we and Mr. Musk paid civil penalties of $20 million 
each and agreed that an independent director will serve as Chair of the Board 
for at least three years, and we appointed suchanindependent Chair of the Board 
and two additional independent directors to the Board, and further enhanced our 
disclosure controls and other corporate governance-related matters. On April 26,
2019, the settlement was amended to modify certain of the previously-agreed 
disclosure procedures to clarify the application of such procedures, which was 
subsequently approved by the Court. All other terms of the prior settlement were
reaffirmed without modification.

Certain Investigations and Other Matters

We receive requests for information from regulators and governmental 
authorities, such as the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, the 
National Transportation Safety Board, the SEC, the Department of Justice (“DOJ”)
and various state, federal and international agencies. We routinely cooperate 
with such regulatory and governmental requests.

In particular, the SEC had issued subpoenas to Tesla in connection with (a) Elon
Musk’s prior statement that he was considering taking Tesla private and (b) 
certain projections that we made for Model 3 production rates during 2017 and 
other public statements relating to Model 3 production. The take-private 
investigation was resolved and closed with the settlement with the SEC described
above. On December 4, 2019, the SEC (i) closed the investigation into the 
projections and other public statements regarding Model 3 production rates and 
(ii) issued a subpoena seeking information concerning certain financial data and
contracts including Tesla’s regular financing arrangements. Separately, the DOJ 
had also asked us to voluntarily provide it with information about the above 
matters related to taking Tesla private and Model 3 production rates.

Aside from the settlement, as amended, with the SEC relating to Mr. Musk’s 
statement that he was considering taking Tesla private, there have not been any 
developments in these matters that we deem to be material, and to our knowledge 
no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that any 
wrongdoing occurred. As is our normal practice, we have been cooperating and 
will continue to cooperate with government authorities. We cannot predict the 
outcome or impact of any ongoing matters. Should the government decide to pursue
an enforcement action, there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact
on our business, results of operation, prospects, cash flows, and financial 
position.

We are also subject to various other legal proceedings and claims that arise 
from the normal course of business activities. If an unfavorable ruling or 
development were to occur, there exists the possibility of a material adverse 
impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash flows, financial 
position and brand.

Indemnification and Guaranteed Returns

We are contractually obligated to compensate certain fund investors for any 
losses that they may suffer in certain limited circumstances resulting from 
reductions in U. S. Treasury grants or investment tax credits (“ITC”s). 
Generally, such obligations would arise as a result of reductions to the value 
of the underlying solar energy systems as assessed by the U. S. Treasury 
Department for purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants or as assessed by the 
IRS for purposes of claiming ITCs or U. S. Treasury grants. For each balance 
sheet date, we assess and recognize, when applicable, a distribution payable for
the potential exposure from this obligation based on all the information 
available at that time, including any guidelines issued by the U. S. Treasury 
Department on solar energy system valuations for purposes of claiming U. S. 
Treasury grants and any audits undertaken by the IRS. We believe that any 
payments to the fund investors in excess of the amounts already recognized by us
for this obligation are not probable or material based on the facts known at the
filing date.

The maximum potential future payments that we could have to make under this 
obligation would depend on the difference between the fair values of the solar 
energy systems sold or transferred to the funds as determined by us and the 
values that the U. S. Treasury Department would determine as fair value for the 
systems for purposes of claiming U. S. Treasury grants or the values the IRS 
would determine as the fair value for the systems for purposes of claiming ITCs 
or U. S. Treasury grants. We claim U. S. Treasury grants based on guidelines 
provided by the U. S. Treasury department and the statutory regulations from the
IRS. We use fair values determined with the assistance of independent 
third-party appraisals commissioned by us as the basis for determining the ITCs 
that are passed-through to and claimed by the fund investors. Since we cannot 
determine future revisions to U. S. Treasury Department guidelines governing 
solar energy system values or how the IRS will evaluate system values used in 
claiming ITCs or U. S. Treasury grants, we are unable to reliably estimate the 
maximum potential future payments that it could have to make under this 
obligation as of each balance sheet date.

We are eligible to receive certain state and local incentives that are 
associated with renewable energy generation. The amount of incentives that can 
be claimed is based on the projected or actual solar energy system size and/or 
the amount of solar energy produced. We also currently participate in one 
state’s incentive program that is based on either the fair market value or the 
tax basis of solar energy systems placed in service. State and local incentives 
received are allocated between us and fund investors in accordance with the 
contractual provisions of each fund. We are not contractually obligated to 
indemnify any fund investor for any losses they may incur due to a shortfall in 
the amount of state or local incentives actually received.

Our lease pass-through financing funds have a one-time lease payment reset 
mechanism that occurs after the installation of all solar energy systems in a 
fund. As a result of this mechanism, we may be required to refund master lease 
prepayments previously received from investors. Any refunds of master lease 
prepayments would reduce the lease pass-through financing obligation.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2019, we had $282 million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
