| **  Leases** | Note 13 - Leases

We have entered into various non-cancellable operating and finance lease 
agreements for certain of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, 
retail and service locations, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, 
worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at 
inception and record the leases in our financial statements upon lease 
commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for 
use by the lessor.

Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease 
term for up to10 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate the
lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of 
calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or 
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such 
options.

Lease expense for operating lease payments is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the lease term. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases
to lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of 
future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date 
for new leases commencing after January 1, 2019. For historical leases, we used 
the index or rate as of the adoption date. Differences between the calculated 
lease payment and actual payment are expensed as incurred. Lease expense for 
finance lease payments is recognized as amortization expense of the finance 
lease ROU asset and interest expense on the finance lease liability over the 
lease term.

The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are 
presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheet:

our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease 
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

Non-cancellable Operating Lease Receivables

Under the new lease standard, we are the lessor of certain vehicle arrangements 
as described in Note 2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies. Following 
the adoption of the new lease standard, solar energy system leases and PPAs that
commenced after January 1, 2019, where we are the lessor and were previously 
accounted for as leases, no longer meet the definition of a lease and are 
therefore not included in the table as ofDecember 31, 2019 (refer to Note 2, 
Summary of Significant Accounting Policies). As of December 31, 2019, maturities
of our operating lease receivables from customers for each of the next five 
years and thereafter were as follows (in millions):

  2020              644  
  2021              494  
  2022              317  
  2023              190  
  2024              191  
  Thereafter      2,294  
  Total           4,130  

U nder legacy lease accounting (ASC 840), future minimum lease payments to be 
received from customers under non-cancellable leases as of December 31, 2018 are
as follows (in millions):

  2019              502  
  2020              418  
  2021              271  
  2022              187  
  2023              189  
  Thereafter      2,469  
  Total           4,036  

The above tables do not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners 
with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. For 
our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power 
produced by the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per 
kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are 
not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by
the related solar energy systems in the future.
