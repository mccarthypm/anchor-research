As of December 31, 2018, the table above included $1.66 billion of non-current 
build-to-suit lease liabilities. As a result of the adoption of the new lease 
standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all build-to-suit lease 
liabilities and have reassessed these leases to be operating lease right-of-use 
liabilities as of December 31, 2019.

Due to price adjustments we made to our vehicle offerings during 2019, we 
increased our sales return reserve significantly on vehicles previously sold 
under our buyback options program. Refer to Note 2, Summary of Significant 
Accounting Policies, for details on these transactions.
