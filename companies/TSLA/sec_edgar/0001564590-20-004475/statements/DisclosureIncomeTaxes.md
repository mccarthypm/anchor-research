A provision for income taxes of $110 million, $58 million and $32 million has 
been recognized for the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, 
respectively, related primarily to our subsidiaries located outside of the U. S.

On December 22, 2017, the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (“Tax Act”) was enacted 
into law making significant changes to the Internal Revenue Code. Changes 
include, but are not limited to, a federal corporate tax rate decrease from 35% 
to 21% for tax years beginning after December 31, 2017, the transition of U. S. 
international taxation from a worldwide tax system to a territorial system and a
one-time transition tax on the mandatory deemed repatriation of foreign 
earnings. We were required to recognize the effect of the tax law changes in the
period of enactment, such as re-measuring our U. S. deferred tax assets and 
liabilities as well as reassessing the net realizability of our deferred tax 
assets and liabilities. The Tax Act did not give rise to any material impact on 
the consolidated balance sheets and consolidated statements of operations due to
our historical worldwide loss position and the full valuation allowance on our 
net U. S. deferred tax assets.

Deferred tax assets (liabilities) as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 consisted of 
the following (in millions):

As of December 31, 2019, we recorded a valuation allowance of $1.96 billion for 
the portion of the deferred tax asset that we do not expect to be realized. The 
valuation allowance on our net deferred taxes increased by $150 million, 
decreased by $38 million, and increased by $821 million during the years ended 
December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017, respectively. The changes in valuation 
allowance are primarily due to additional U. S. deferred tax assets and 
liabilities incurred in the respective year. We have net $151 million of 
deferred tax assets in foreign jurisdictions, which management believes are 
more-likely-than-not to be fully realized given the expectation of future 
earnings in these jurisdictions. We continue to monitor the realizability of the
U. S. deferred tax assets taking into account multiple factors, including the 
results of operations and magnitude of excess tax deductions for stock-based 
compensation. We intend to continue maintaining a full valuation allowance on 
our U. S. deferred tax assets until there is sufficient evidence to support the 
reversal of all or some portion of these allowances. Release of all, or a 
portion, of the valuation allowance would result in the recognition of certain 
deferred tax assets and a decrease to income tax expense for the period the 
release is recorded.

As of December 31, 2019, we had $7.51 billion of federal and $6.16 billion of 
state net operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future taxable 
income, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2024 for federal and 
2028 for state purposes. A portion of these losses were generated by SolarCity 
prior to our acquisition in 2016 and, therefore, are subject to change of 
control provisions, which limit the amount of acquired tax attributes that can 
be utilized in a given tax year. We do not expect these change of control 
limitations to significantly impact our ability to utilize these attributes.

As of December 31, 2019, we had research and development tax credits of $320 
million and $284 million for federal and state income tax purposes, 
respectively. If not utilized, the federal research and development tax credits 
will expire in various amounts beginning in 2024. However, the state research 
and development tax credits can be carried forward indefinitely. In addition, we
have other general business tax credits of $125 million for federal income tax 
purposes, which will not begin to significantly expire until 2033.

No deferred tax liabilities for foreign withholding taxes have been recorded 
relating to the earnings of our foreign subsidiaries since all such earnings are
intended to be indefinitely reinvested. The amount of the unrecognized deferred 
tax liability associated with these earnings is immaterial.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an “ownership 
change,” as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. We have 
determined that no significant limitation would be placed on the utilization of 
our net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards due to prior ownership 
changes.

Uncertain Tax Positions

The changes to our gross unrecognized tax benefits were as follows (in 
millions):

  December 31, 2016                                                  204

  Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions           (6  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax                   60  
  December 31, 2018                                                  253  
  Decreases in balances related to prior year tax positions          (39  
  Increases in balances related to current year tax                   59  
  December 31, 2019                                                  273  

As of December 31, 2019, accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized 
tax benefits are classified as income tax expense and were immaterial. 
Unrecognized tax benefits of $247 million, if recognized, would not affect our 
effective tax rate since the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset 
that is currently fully offset by a full valuation allowance.

We file income tax returns in the U. S., California and various state and 
foreign jurisdictions. We are currently under examination by the IRS for the 
years 2015 and 2016. Additional tax years within the period 2004 to 2018 remain 
subject to examination for federal income tax purposes, and tax years 2004 to 
2018 remain subject to examination for California income tax purposes. All net 
operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to adjustment for
U. S. federal and California income tax purposes. Tax years 2008 to 2018 remain 
subject to examination in other U. S. state and foreign jurisdictions.

The potential outcome of the current examination could result in a change to 
unrecognized tax benefits within the next twelve months. However, we cannot 
reasonably estimate possible adjustments at this time.

The U. S. Tax Court issued a decision inAltera Corp v. Commissionerrelated to 
the treatment of stock-based compensation expense in a cost-sharing arrangement.
On June 7, 2019, the Court reversed the Tax Court decision and upheld the 
validity of Treas. Reg. Section 1.482-7A(d)(2), requiring stock-based 
compensation costs be included in the costs shared under a cost sharing 
agreement. Given that the current active decision can still be appealed because 
Altera has the option to petition up to the Supreme Court, Tesla’s position is 
to continue to include stock-based compensation in cost sharing allocation 
agreement. If and when the current tax court’s decision is overturned, we will 
treat the amount previously shared as a pre-payment to future cost sharing 
agreement costs. Because we have a full valuation allowance in the U. S., any 
potential tax benefits would increase our U. S. deferred tax asset and would not
have a material impact to our financials.
