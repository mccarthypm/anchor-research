As of December 31, 2018, the table above included $1.69 billion of gross 
build-to-suit lease assets. As a result of the adoption of the new lease 
standard on January 1, 2019, we have de-recognized all build-to-suit lease 
assets and have reassessed these leases to be operating lease right-of-use 
assets within the consolidated balance sheet as of December 31, 2019 (see Note 
2, Summary of Significant Accounting Policies).

Construction in progress is primarily comprised of tooling and equipment related
to the manufacturing of our products and Gigafactory Shanghai construction. 
Completed assets are transferred to their respective asset classes, and 
depreciation begins when an asset is ready for its intended use. Interest on 
outstanding debt is capitalized during periods of significant capital asset 
construction and amortized over the useful lives of the related assets. During 
the years ended December 31, 2019 and 2018, we capitalized $31 million and $55 
million, respectively, of interest.

Depreciation expense during the years ended December 31, 2019, 2018 and 2017 was
$1.37 billion, $1.11 billion and $769 million, respectively. Gross property 
plant and equipment under finance leases as of December 31, 2019 and 2018 was 
$2.08 billion and $1.52 billion, respectively. Accumulated depreciation on 
property, plant and equipment under finance leases as of these dates was $483 
million and $232 million, respectively.

Panasonic has partnered with us on Gigafactory Nevada with investments in the 
production equipment that it uses to manufacture and supply us with battery 
cells. Under our arrangement with Panasonic, we plan to purchase the full output
from their production equipment at negotiated prices. As the terms of the 
arrangement convey a finance lease under ASC 842, Leases, we account for their 
production equipment as leased assets when production commences. This results in
us recording the cost of their production equipment within property, plant and 
equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets with a corresponding 
liability recorded to debt and finance leases. As of December 31, 2019 and 2018,
we had cumulatively capitalized costs of $1.73 billion and $1.24 billion, 
respectively, on the consolidated balance sheets in relation to the production 
equipment under our Panasonic arrangement. We had cumulatively capitalized total
costs for Gigafactory Nevada, including costs under our Panasonic arrangement, 
of $5.27 billion and $4.62 billion as of December 31, 2019 and 2018, 
respectively.

In 2019, the Shanghai government agreed to provide $85 million of certain 
incentives in connection with us making certain manufacturing equipment 
investments at Gigafactory Shanghai, of which $46 million was received in cash 
and the remaining $39 million was in the form of assets and services contributed
by the government. These incentives were taken as a reduction to property, plant
and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheet.
