|   Amendment Description | On February 8, 2021, Tesla, Inc. (“Tesla,” the “Company,” “we,” “us,” or “our”) filed our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (the “Original Form 10-K”). The Original Form 10-K omitted Part III, Items 10 (Directors, Executive Officers and Corporate Governance), 11 (Executive Compensation), 12 (Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters), 13 (Certain Relationships and Related Transactions, and Director Independence) and 14 (Principal Accountant Fees and Services) in reliance on General Instruction G(3) to Form 10-K, which provides that such information may be either incorporated by reference from the registrant’s definitive proxy statement or included in an amendment to Form 10-K, in either case filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission (the “SEC”) not later than 120 days after the end of the fiscal year.
We currently expect that our definitive proxy statement for the 2021 annual meeting of stockholders will be filed later than the 120th day after the end of the last fiscal year. Accordingly, this Amendment No. 1 to Form 10-K (this “Amendment”) is being filed solely to:




 

•

amend Part III, Items 10, 11, 12, 13 and 14 of the Original Form 10-K to include the information required by such Items;




 

•

delete the reference on the cover of the Original Form 10-K to the incorporation by reference of portions of our proxy statement into Part III of the Original Form 10-K; and




 

•

file new certifications of our principal executive officer and principal financial officer as exhibits to this Amendment under Item 15 of Part IV hereof, pursuant to Rule 12b-15 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “Exchange Act”).
This Amendment does not otherwise change or update any of the disclosures set forth in the Original Form 10-K and does not otherwise reflect any events occurring after the filing of the Original Form 10-K. |
