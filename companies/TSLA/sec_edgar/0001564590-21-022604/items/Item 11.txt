Compensation Discussion and Analysis

The following discussion and analysis of compensation arrangements of our named executive officers for 2020 should be read together with the compensation tables and related disclosures set forth below. This discussion contains forward-looking statements that are based on our current considerations, expectations and determinations regarding future compensation programs. The actual amount and form of compensation and the compensation programs that we adopt may differ materially from current or planned programs as summarized in this discussion.

The following discussion and analysis relates to the compensation arrangements for 2020 of (i) our principal executive officer, (ii) our principal financial officer and (iii) the two most highly compensated persons, other than our principal executive officer and principal financial officer, who were serving as executive officers at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020 (our “named executive officers”). We had no other executive officers serving at the end of our fiscal year ended December 31, 2020. Our named executive officers for fiscal year 2020 were:

Compensation Philosophy

As the world’s first vertically integrated sustainable energy company, our mission is to accelerate the world’s transition to sustainable energy. We design, develop, manufacture and sell high-performance, fully electric vehicles and energy generation and storage systems, and also install and maintain such energy systems and sell solar electricity. To achieve our goals, we have designed, and intend to modify as necessary, our compensation and benefits program and philosophy, to attract, retain and incentivize talented, deeply qualified and committed executive officers who share our philosophy and desire to work toward these goals. We believe compensation incentives for executive officers should promote the success of our company and motivate them to pursue corporate objectives. We have put an emphasis on structuring compensation incentives so as to reward clear, easily measured performance goals that closely align their incentives with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Further, we have sought to harmonize the compensation structures of our other employees to conform to our overall compensation philosophy.

Our current compensation programs reflect our startup origins in that they consist primarily of salary and equity awards. Consistent with our historical compensation philosophy, we do not currently provide an annual cash bonus program or any severance provisions for continued cash payments or other benefits upon termination of employment with us.

As our needs evolve, we intend to continue to evaluate our philosophy and compensation programs as circumstances require, and, at a minimum, the Compensation Committee will review executive compensation annually. We may from time to time make new equity awards and adjustments to the components of our executive compensation program in connection with our periodic compensation review.

Key Factors in Determining Executive Compensation

Role of Compensation Committee in Executive Compensation

The Compensation Committee has overall responsibility for recommending to the Board the compensation of our Chief Executive Officer and determining the compensation of our other executive officers. Members of the Compensation Committee are appointed by the Board. Currently, the Compensation Committee consists of three members of the Board: Ira Ehrenpreis (Chair), Robyn Denholm and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson, none of whom is an executive officer of Tesla, and each of whom qualifies as (i) an “independent director” under the NASDAQ Stock Market Rules and (ii) an “outside director” under Section 162(m) of the Internal Revenue Code (the “Code”).

Role of Compensation Consultants

The Compensation Committee has the authority to engage and has from time to time engaged the services of outside consultants to assist in making decisions regarding the establishment of Tesla’s compensation philosophy and programs, including for executives and directors. 

Role of Executive Officers in Compensation Decisions

Historically, for executive officers other than our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought and considered input from our Chief Executive Officer regarding such executive officers’ responsibilities, performance and compensation. Specifically, our Chief Executive Officer recommends base salary increases and equity award levels for our senior personnel, and advises the Compensation Committee regarding the compensation program’s ability to attract, retain and motivate executive talent. These recommendations reflect compensation levels that our Chief Executive Officer believes are qualitatively commensurate with an executive officer’s individual qualifications, experience, responsibility level, functional role, knowledge, skills and individual performance, as well as Tesla’s performance. The Compensation Committee considers our Chief Executive Officer’s recommendations, but ultimately determines compensation in its judgment, and approves the specific compensation for all of our executive officers (other than for our Chief Executive Officer, which is approved by the Board). All such compensation determinations by our Compensation Committee are largely discretionary.

The Compensation Committee meets regularly in executive session. Our Chief Executive Officer is not present during Compensation Committee deliberations or votes on his compensation and also recuses himself from sessions of the Board where the Board acts on the Compensation Committee’s recommendations regarding his compensation. In addition, the Board has established a management committee under the Tesla, Inc. 2019 Equity 

6

Incentive Plan (the “Equity Award Committee”) to grant and administer equity awards, subject to certain maximum limits on the seniority of personnel to whom the Equity Award Committee may grant awards and the value of any individual award. For example, the Equity Award Committee is not authorized to grant awards to executive officer-level employees. Moreover, pursuant to applicable law, the Equity Award Committee may not grant awards to its members, and the number of shares of our common stock underlying awards granted by it may not exceed amounts determined by the Board from time to time. The Board has delegated to the Compensation Committee oversight authority over the Equity Award Committee.

Role of Stockholder Say-on-Pay Votes

At the 2011 annual meeting of our stockholders and at each annual meeting held every three years since, including most recently in 2020, we held triennial stockholder advisory “say-on-pay” votes on the compensation of our named executive officers for the immediately preceding fiscal years. Each time, our stockholders overwhelmingly approved the compensation of our named executive officers, with over 83% of our stockholders present and entitled to vote at each meeting voting in favor of our compensation policies for our named executive officers. Given these results, and following consideration of them, the Compensation Committee has decided to retain our overall approach to executive compensation while continuing to evaluate our practices frequently, including in response to future say-on-pay votes. Moreover, we are required to hold a vote at least every six years regarding how often to hold a stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers. We held our most recent such vote at the 2017 annual meeting of stockholders, at which our stockholders indicated a preference for a triennial vote. Consequently, the Board determined that we will hold a triennial stockholder advisory vote on the compensation of our named executive officers until they consider the results of our next say-on-pay frequency vote, which will be held at the 2023 annual meeting of stockholders.

Clawback Policy

Our Corporate Governance Guidelines sets forth a compensation recovery (“clawback”) policy with respect to any annual incentive payment or long-term incentive payment that may be received by an executive officer, where such payment would be predicated upon achieving certain financial results that were subsequently the subject of a restatement of our financial statements, and a lower payment would have been made to the executive based upon the restated financial results. In such case, the Board has the authority to seek to recover from the executive officer the amount by which such officer’s incentive payments for the relevant period exceeded the lower payment that would have been made based on the restated financial results.

Moreover, the terms of the performance-based stock option award granted to Elon Musk in January 2018 (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”) include a clawback provision in the event of a restatement of our financial statements previously filed with the SEC. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” under this Item 11 below.

Current Elements of Named Executive Officer Compensation

Overview and Fiscal Year 2020 Company Highlights

Our current executive compensation program, which was developed and approved by the Compensation Committee, generally consists of base salary, equity-based incentives and other benefits. We combine these elements in order to formulate compensation packages that provide competitive pay and align the interests of our named executive officers with long-term stockholder interests by rewarding the achievement of financial, operational and strategic objectives. In 2020, Tesla’s full-year accomplishments under our executive leadership included the following:

•

Total revenues of $31.54 billion, representing an increase of $6.96 billion compared to the prior year;

•

Net income attributable to common stockholders of $721 million and an operating margin of 6.3%, representing favorable changes of $1.58 billion and 6.6%, respectively, compared to the prior year;

•

Year-end cash and cash equivalents balance of $19.38 billion, representing an increase of $13.12 billion from the end of the prior year;

•

Annual vehicle delivery and production records of 499,647 and 509,737 total vehicles;

•

3.02 gigawatt hours of energy storage and 205 megawatts of solar energy systems deployed; and

7

•

Ongoing progress in the global growth of our manufacturing capabilities, including the commencement of production of Model Y, expansion of Gigafactory Shanghai and groundbreaking at Gigafactory Berlin and Gigafactory Texas.

Base Salary

The Compensation Committee is responsible for reviewing our Chief Executive Officer’s and other executive officers’ base salaries. The base salaries of all executive officers are reviewed annually and adjusted when necessary to reflect individual roles, performance and the competitive market. Because we typically do not provide cash bonuses to our executive officers, salary is the primary cash-based element of our executive officers’ compensation structure.

The following table sets forth information regarding the annualized base salary rates at the end of 2020 for our named executive officers:

Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.

In April 2020, the base salaries of our named executive officers were reduced by 30%. This reduction was part of a company-wide reduction (subject to applicable laws) for salaried employees, which was intended to be a proactive and temporary response to global market conditions. The rate of reduction in base salary for our vice president-level and higher employees, including our named executive officers, was higher than those applicable to all other salaried employees. Subject to applicable laws, such reductions were eliminated after approximately 11 weeks.

Equity-Based Incentives

Our equity award program is the primary vehicle for offering long-term incentives to our named executive officers. Our equity-based incentives have historically been granted in the form of options to purchase shares of our common stock and restricted stock unit awards that are settled in shares of our common stock upon vesting, and we have granted to our named executive officers both awards that vest over a long-term period and awards that vest only upon the achievement of specified Tesla performance milestones, in each case subject to continued service. We believe that equity awards more closely align the interests of our named executive officers with our stockholders, provide our named executive officers with incentives linked to long-term performance and create an ownership culture. In addition, the vesting features of our equity awards contribute to executive retention because these features provide an incentive to our named executive officers to remain in our employ during the scheduled vesting periods or until the achievement of the applicable performance milestones, which are expected to be achieved over the medium- to long-term. To date, we have not had an established set of criteria for granting equity awards; instead, the Compensation Committee exercises its judgment and discretion, in consultation with our Chief Executive Officer and from time to time, a compensation consultant. The Compensation Committee considers, among other things, the role and responsibility of the named executive officer, competitive factors, the amount of stock-based equity compensation already held by the named executive officer and the cash-based compensation received by the named executive officer, to determine the level and types of equity awards that it approves.

The Compensation Committee meets periodically, including to approve equity award grants to our executives from time to time. We do not have, nor do we plan to establish, any program, plan or practice to time equity award grants in coordination with releasing material non-public information. We generally grant one-time new hire equity awards to our employees upon their commencement of employment with us, or upon their promotion to new 

8

positions. Additionally, as part of our ongoing executive compensation review and alignment process, we periodically grant equity awards to our executives. See “Grants of Plan-Based Awards in 2020” under this Item 11 below.

Severance and Change in Control Benefits

No named executive officer has a severance or change in control arrangement with Tesla, other than the vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance Award based solely upon the achievement of market capitalization milestones as measured at the time of a change in control of Tesla. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” and “Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control” under this Item 11 below.

Bonus

We do not currently have or have planned, and we typically have not historically entered into, any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for cash-based bonus awards.

Non-Equity Incentive Plan Compensation

We did not provide any non-equity incentive plan compensation to any of our named executive officers in 2020, and we do not currently have or have planned any specific arrangements with our named executive officers providing for non-equity incentive plan compensation.

Perquisites

Generally, we do not provide any perquisites or other personal benefits to our named executive officers except in certain limited circumstances. 

Health and Welfare Benefits

We provide the following benefits to our named executive officers on the same basis provided to all of our employees:

•

medical insurance including comprehensive transgender coverage, mental health, dental and vision;

•

confidential counseling; 

•

life insurance and accidental death and dismemberment insurance;

•

a Section 401(k) plan for which no match by Tesla is provided;

•

an employee stock purchase plan;

•

short-and long-term disability insurance;

•

medical and dependent care flexible spending account; and

•

a health savings account.

Chief Executive Officer Compensation

Overview

Historically, in developing compensation recommendations for our Chief Executive Officer, the Compensation Committee has sought both to appropriately reward our Chief Executive Officer’s previous and current contributions and to create incentives for our Chief Executive Officer to continue to contribute significantly to successful results in the future. Each of the 2018 CEO Performance Award and the performance-based stock option award granted to our Chief Executive Officer in August 2012 (the “2012 CEO Performance Award”) is focused on this latter objective, as it solely rewards future performance. 

In addition to serving as our Chief Executive Officer since October 2008, Elon Musk has contributed significantly and actively to us since our earliest days in April 2004 by recruiting executives and engineers, contributing to vehicle engineering and design, raising capital for us and bringing investors to us and raising public awareness of Tesla.

Cash Compensation

Mr. Musk historically earned a base salary that reflected the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law, and he was subject to income taxes based on such base salary. However, he has never accepted his salary. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.

Historical Equity Compensation

Prior to stock option awards made in December 2009, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity compensation for his services for a period of five years.

In 2010 and 2011, Mr. Musk did not receive any equity grants, because the Compensation Committee believed his existing grants made in December 2009 already provided sufficient motivation for Mr. Musk to perform his duties as Chief Executive Officer.

In August 2012, to create incentives for continued long-term success from the then-recently launched Model S program as well as from Tesla’s then-planned Model X and Model 3 programs, and to further align executive compensation with increases in stockholder value, the Board granted to Mr. Musk the 2012 CEO Performance Award, comprised of a stock option award to purchase 26,374,505 shares (as adjusted for the five-for-one stock split effected in the form of a stock dividend in August 2020, or the “Stock Split”) of Tesla’s common stock, representing 5% of Tesla’s total issued and outstanding shares at the time of grant. The 2012 CEO Performance Award consists of 10 equal vesting tranches, each requiring that Tesla meet a combination of (i) the achievement of a specified operational milestone relating to development of Model X or Model 3, aggregate vehicle production or a gross margin target, and (ii) a sustained incremental $4 billion increase in Tesla’s market capitalization from $3.2 billion, Tesla’s market capitalization at the time of grant. The market capitalization conditions for all of the 10 vesting tranches and nine of the 10 operational milestones have been achieved, and therefore nine of 10 tranches under the 2012 CEO Performance Award have vested. As of April 29, 2021, only one operational milestone, requiring that Tesla achieve gross margin of 30% or more for four consecutive quarters, has not been achieved and remains outstanding.

Prior to 2018, the only additional equity awards received by Mr. Musk related to certain immaterial awards granted during 2013 pursuant to a patent incentive program that was available to our employees generally.

2018 CEO Performance Award

Early in 2017, with the 2012 CEO Performance Award heading to substantial completion after having helped Tesla grow its market capitalization to over $55 billion in just over five years, the independent members of the Board began preliminary discussions regarding how to continue to incentivize Mr. Musk to lead Tesla through the next phase of its development. In January 2018, following more than six months of careful analysis and development led by the Compensation Committee, with participation by every independent Board member, the help of Compensia, a national compensation consulting firm, and engagement with and feedback from our largest institutional stockholders, the Board granted the 2018 CEO Performance Award to Mr. Musk. Such grant was subject to approval by a majority of the total votes of Tesla common stock not owned by Mr. Musk or Kimbal Musk cast at a meeting of the stockholders to approve the 2018 CEO Performance Award. On March 21, 2018, such approval was obtained, with approximately 73% of the votes cast by such disinterested shares voting in favor of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

10

The 2018 CEO Performance Award is comprised of a 10-year maximum term stock option to purchase 101,320,210 shares (as adjusted for the Stock Split) of Tesla’s common stock, divided equally among 12 separate tranches that are each equivalent to 1% of the issued and outstanding shares of Tesla’s common stock at the time of grant, at an exercise price of $70.01 per share (as adjusted for the Stock Split). Each of the 12 vesting tranches of the 2018 CEO Performance Award vests upon certification by the Board that both (i) the market capitalization milestone for such tranche, which begins at $100 billion for the first tranche and increases by increments of $50 billion thereafter, and (ii) any one of the following 8 operational milestones focused on revenue or 8 operational milestones focused on profitability, has been met:

Total Revenue*

$8.0

$125.0

$10.0

$14.0

*

“Revenue” means total revenues as reported in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters.

**

“Adjusted EBITDA” means (i) net income (loss) attributable to common stockholders before (ii) interest expense, (iii) (benefit) provision for income taxes, (iv) depreciation and amortization, and (v) stock-based compensation, as each such item is reported in Tesla’s financial statements on Forms 10-Q or 10-K filed with the SEC for the previous four consecutive fiscal quarters.

Any single operational milestone may only satisfy the vesting requirement of one tranche, together with the corresponding market capitalization milestone. Subject to any applicable clawback provisions, policies or other forfeiture terms, once a milestone is achieved, it is forever deemed achieved for determining the vesting of a tranche. Meeting more than 12 of the 16 operational milestones will not result in any additional vesting or other compensation to Mr. Musk under the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Except in a change in control situation, measurement of the market capitalization milestones will be based on both (i) a six calendar month trailing average of Tesla’s stock price as well as (ii) a 30 calendar day trailing average of Tesla’s stock price, in each case based on trading days only. Upon the consummation of certain acquisitions or split-up, spin-off or divestiture transactions, each then-unachieved market capitalization milestone and/or operational milestone will be adjusted to offset the impact of such transactions to the extent they could be considered material to the achievement of those milestones.

In establishing the Revenue and Adjusted EBITDA milestones, the Board carefully considered a variety of factors, including Tesla’s growth trajectory and internal growth plans and the historical performance of other high-growth and high-multiples companies in the technology space that have invested in new businesses and tangible assets. These benchmarks provided revenue/EBITDA to market capitalization multiples, which were then used to inform the specific operational targets that aligned with Tesla’s plans for future growth. Nevertheless, the Board considered each of the market capitalization and operational milestones to be challenging hurdles. For example, in order to meet all 12 market capitalization milestones, Tesla will have to add approximately $600 billion to its market capitalization at the time of the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award, and in order to satisfy all eight revenue-based operational milestones, Tesla would have to increase revenue by more than $163 billion from its annual revenue of approximately $11.8 billion in 2017, the last fiscal year completed prior to the grant of the 2018 CEO Performance Award.

In addition, Mr. Musk must continue to lead Tesla as our Chief Executive Officer or, alternatively, as our Chief Product Officer and Executive Chairman (with any other Chief Executive Officer reporting directly to him), at the time each milestone is met in order for the corresponding tranche to vest. With limited exceptions, Mr. Musk must hold any shares that he acquires upon exercise of the 2018 CEO Performance Award for at least five years post-exercise. There will be no acceleration of vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance award upon Mr. Musk’s termination, death or disability, or a change in control of Tesla. However, in a change in control situation, the achievement of the milestones will be based solely on the market capitalization milestones, with the measurement of Tesla’s market capitalization determined by the product of the total number of outstanding shares of Tesla common 

11

stock immediately before the change in control multiplied by the greater of the last closing price of a share of Tesla common stock before the effective time of the change in control or the per share price (plus the per share value of any other consideration) received by Tesla’s stockholders in the change in control. 

In the event of a restatement of Tesla’s financial statements previously filed with the SEC, if a lesser portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award would have vested based on the restated financial results, then Tesla will require forfeiture (or repayment, as applicable) of the portion of the 2018 CEO Performance Award that would not have vested based on the restated financial results (less any amounts Mr. Musk may have paid to Tesla in exercising any forfeited awards). The 2018 CEO Performance Award also will be subject, if more stringent than the foregoing, to any current or future Tesla clawback policy applicable to equity awards, provided that the policy does not discriminate solely against Mr. Musk except as required by applicable law.

As of April 29, 2021, six operational milestones and 11 market capitalization milestones have been achieved, of which six operational milestones and six market capitalization milestones have also been certified by our Board of Directors. Consequently, six of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award, corresponding to options to purchase an aggregate 50,660,105 shares of Tesla’s common stock, have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise.

Realized Compensation

For purposes of the table in “Summary Compensation Table” under this Item 11 below, we are required to report pursuant to applicable SEC rules any stock option grants to Mr. Musk at values determined as of their respective grant dates and which are driven by certain assumptions prescribed by Financial Accounting Board Accounting Standards Codification Topic 718, “Compensation–Stock Compensation” (“ASC Topic 718”). Moreover, we are required to report in “Pay Ratio Disclosure” under this Item 11 below (i) Mr. Musk’s annual total compensation, (ii) the median of the annual total compensation of all Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis, other than Mr. Musk, in each case calculated pursuant to the methodology used for the table under “Summary Compensation Table,” and (iii) the ratio of the former to the latter.

In addition, we are required to report in “2020 Option Exercises and Stock Vested” under this Item 11 below an amount for the “value realized” upon: (i) any exercise by Mr. Musk of a stock option, which is based on the difference between the market price of the underlying shares at the time of exercise and the exercise price of the stock option, and (ii) any vesting of a restricted stock unit award, based on the market price of the award at the time of vesting. Such amount is required to be reported even if Mr. Musk does not actually receive any cash from such exercise or vesting, either because he does not also sell any shares or because he sells only a number of shares sufficient to cover the related tax liabilities resulting from the exercise or vesting.

As a result, there may be a significant disconnect between what is reported as compensation for Mr. Musk in a given year in such sections and the value actually realized as compensation in that year or over a period of time. Moreover, the vast majority of compensation in respect of past stock option grants to Mr. Musk, including the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award, were structured to be incentives for future performance with their value realizable only if Tesla’s stock price appreciated compared to the dates of the grants, and if the Company achieved applicable vesting requirements.

To supplement the disclosures in “Summary Compensation Table,” “Pay Ratio Disclosure” and “2020 Option Exercises and Stock Vested” under this Item 11 below, we have included the following table, which shows the total realized compensation of Mr. Musk for the last three fiscal years, as well as the ratio of Mr. Musk’s realized compensation to the median of the annual total compensation of all other Tesla employees qualifying for this analysis as reported under “Pay Ratio Disclosure.” Realized compensation is not a substitute for reported compensation in evaluating our compensation structure, but we believe that realized compensation is an important factor in understanding that the value of compensation that Mr. Musk ultimately realizes is dependent on a number of additional factors, including: (i) the vesting of certain of his option awards only upon the successful achievement of a number of market capitalization increase and operational milestone targets, including milestones that have not yet been achieved under each of the 2012 CEO Performance Award and the 2018 CEO Performance Award; (ii) the fact that Mr. Musk does not receive any cash if he does not actually sell shares and thereby reduce his investment in 

12

us, and he does not receive any cash to the extent that he sells only shares sufficient to cover income taxes with respect to his awards (including stock options exercised solely to avoid their expiration in accordance with their terms); and (iii) the then-current market value of our common stock at the times at which Mr. Musk may elect to actually sell his shares.

“Total CEO realized compensation” for a given year is defined as (i) the amounts reported for Mr. Musk in “Summary Compensation Table” under this Item 11 below under the columns “Salary,” “Bonus,” “Non‑Equity Incentive Plan Compensation” and “All Other Compensation,” plus (ii) with respect to any stock option exercised by Mr. Musk in such year in connection with which shares of stock were also sold other than to satisfy any resulting tax liability, the difference between the market price of such shares at the time of exercise and the applicable exercise price of the option, plus (iii) with respect to any restricted stock unit vested by Mr. Musk in such year in connection with which shares of stock were also sold other than automatic sales to satisfy any withholding obligations related to such vesting, the market price of such shares at the time of vesting, plus (iv) any cash actually received by Mr. Musk in respect of any shares sold to cover tax liabilities as described in (ii) and (iii) above, following the payment of such tax liabilities.

(2)

Of the amounts noted, Mr. Musk has not accepted his salary in the amounts of $23,760 and $56,380 for 2019 and 2018, respectively.

(3)

Reflects, for 2019, the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law for part of such year. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.

(4)

Reflects the exercise of a vested stock option award as to which Mr. Musk paid the exercise price in cash. None of the shares received upon exercise have been sold, and therefore this amount has not been received by Mr. Musk. 

(5)

Includes $2,283,988,504 attributed to the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which is intended to compensate Mr. Musk over its 10-year maximum term and will become vested as to all shares subject to it only if our market capitalization increases to $650.0 billion and 12 of 16 total operational milestones are achieved during such 10-year period. Each tranche of 1/12th of the total number of shares subject to the option becomes vested and exercisable each time: (i) our market capitalization increases initially to $100.0 billion for the first tranche, and by an additional $50.0 billion for each tranche thereafter; and (ii) one of 16 specified operational milestones relating to total revenue or adjusted EBITDA (other than any operating milestone that previously counted towards the vesting of another tranche) is attained, subject to Mr. Musk’s continued service to us as either CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer, with the CEO reporting to him, at each such vesting event. This award was designed to be entirely an incentive for future performance that would take many years, if at all, to be achieved. Further, each of the requirements underlying the performance milestones was selected to be very difficult to achieve. If any options have not vested by the end of the term of the option award, they will be forfeited and Mr. Musk will not realize the value of such options. As of April 29, 2021, six of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” under this Item 11 above.

Tax and Accounting Considerations

Sections 280G and 409A. We have not provided or committed to provide any executive officer or director with a gross-up or other reimbursement for tax amounts the executive might pay pursuant to Section 280G or Section 409A of the Code. Section 280G and related Code sections provide that executive officers, directors who hold significant stockholder interests and certain other service providers could be subject to significant additional taxes if they receive payments or benefits in connection with a change in control of Tesla that exceeds certain limits, and that we or our successor could lose a deduction on the amounts subject to the additional tax. Section 409A also imposes additional significant taxes on the individual in the event that an executive officer, director or service provider of certain types receives “deferred compensation” that does not meet the requirements of Section 409A.

Tax Deduction Limit. Section 162(m) of the Code generally disallows a tax deduction to public corporations for compensation greater than $1,000,000 paid in any fiscal year to certain executive officers. However, prior to the enactment of U.S. tax legislation in December 2017 (the “Tax Act”), certain types of performance-based compensation were excluded from the $1,000,000 deduction limit if specific requirements were met. Under the Tax Act, this exclusion for performance-based compensation is not available with respect to taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, unless the compensation is pursuant to a written binding contract which was in effect on or before November 2, 2017, and which is not modified in any material respect on or after such date. Pursuant to the Tax Act, for taxable years beginning after December 31, 2017, Section 162(m) of the Code was expanded to cover additional executive officers and other employees, including the chief financial officer, so that the compensation of the chief executive officer and chief financial officer (at any time during the fiscal year), the three next most highly compensated executive officers during the taxable year and any other individual who was considered a “covered employee” for any prior taxable year that begins after 2016, will be subject to the $1,000,000 deductibility limit under Section 162(m) of the Code. Commencing with our 2018 fiscal year, to the extent that the aggregate amount of any covered officer’s salary, bonus, any amount realized from certain option exercises and vesting of restricted stock units or other equity awards, and certain other compensation amounts that are recognized as taxable income by the officer exceeds $1,000,000, we will not be entitled to a U.S. federal income tax deduction for the amount over $1,000,000 in that year, unless the compensation qualifies for the transition relief applicable to certain written binding contracts in effect on or before November 2, 2017. The Compensation Committee has not adopted a formal policy regarding tax deductibility of compensation paid to our executive officers.

Accounting Implications. We follow ASC Topic 718 for our stock-based compensation awards. ASC Topic 718 requires companies to measure the compensation expense for all stock-based compensation awards made to employees and directors based on the grant date “fair value” of these awards. This calculation is performed for accounting purposes and reported in the compensation tables below, even though our named executive officers may never realize any value from their awards. ASC Topic 718 also requires companies to recognize the compensation cost of their stock-based compensation awards in their income statements over the period that an executive officer is required to render service in exchange for the option or other award.

Compensation Committee Report

The Compensation Committee oversees Tesla’s compensation programs, policies and practices. The Compensation Committee has reviewed and discussed the Compensation Discussion and Analysis required by Item 402(b) of Regulation S-K with management. Based on such review and discussions, the Compensation Committee has recommended to the Board that the Compensation Discussion and Analysis be included in this Amendment.

This column reflects the grant date fair value computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718 of the restricted stock unit awards granted to the named executive officers, which is measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common stock. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive officers, which depends, among other things, on the market value of our common stock.

(2)

This column reflects the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718 of the options to purchase shares of our common stock granted to the named executive officers. The assumptions used in the valuation of these awards are set forth in Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included in the Original Form 10-K. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by the named executive officers, which depends, among other things, on the market value of our common stock appreciating from that on the grant date(s) of the option(s).

(3)

Reflects the applicable minimum wage requirements under California law for part of 2019. Commencing in May 2019 at Mr. Musk’s request, we eliminated altogether the earning and accrual of this base salary.

(4)

Reflects the 2018 CEO Performance Award, which is intended to compensate Mr. Musk over its 10-year maximum term and will become vested as to all shares subject to it only if our market capitalization increases to $650.0 billion and 12 of 16 total operational milestones are achieved during such 10-year period. Each tranche of 1/12th of the total number of shares subject to the option will become vested and exercisable each time: (i) our market capitalization increases initially to $100.0 billion for the first tranche, and by an additional $50.0 billion for each tranche thereafter; and (ii) one of 16 specified operational milestones relating to total revenue or adjusted EBITDA (other than any operating milestone that previously counted towards the vesting of another tranche) is attained, subject to Mr. Musk’s continued service to us as either CEO or as both Executive Chairman and Chief Product Officer, with the CEO reporting to him, at each such vesting event. This award was designed to be entirely an incentive for future performance that would take many years, if at all, to be achieved. Further, each of the requirements underlying the performance milestones was selected to be very difficult to achieve. If any options have not vested by the end of the term of the option award, they will be forfeited and Mr. Musk will not realize the value of such options. As of April 29, 2021, six of the 12 tranches under the 2018 CEO Performance Award have vested and become exercisable, subject to Mr. Musk’s payment of the exercise price of $70.01 per share and the minimum five-year holding period generally applicable to any shares he acquires upon exercise. See “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” and “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—Realized Compensation” under this Item 11 above.

(5)

Reflects a temporary reduction to base salary in response to global market conditions.  

(6)

Reflects an amount corresponding to previously-accrued paid time off that was applied toward the purchase of a Tesla vehicle pursuant to a company-wide program.

Pay Ratio Disclosure

Tesla is committed to fair and competitive compensation for our employees. Moreover, Elon Musk, the Technoking of Tesla and our Chief Executive Officer, has agreed to a compensation arrangement in the 2018 CEO Performance Award that is substantially tied to the appreciation of our market capitalization. Because equity awards are generally made available to Tesla employees, this also means that Mr. Musk’s compensation is tied to the success of Tesla employees. We are providing a ratio of (i) Mr. Musk’s 2020 annual total compensation to (ii) the median of the 2020 annual total compensation of all applicable qualifying Tesla employees other than Mr. Musk, as if all of such employees were named executive officers, in each case calculated pursuant to the disclosure requirements of “Summary Compensation Table” above. As we continue our international expansion, the median annual total compensation of our employees reflects differences in local compensation scales and practices abroad to a greater extent.

Mr. Musk’s 2020 annual total compensation, as reported under “Summary Compensation Table,” was $0, and the median 2020 annual total compensation of all other qualifying employees, as determined pursuant to the methodology set forth below, was $46,150. Consequently, the applicable ratio of such amounts for 2020 was 0.00:1. 

Our methodology for identifying the median of the 2020 annual total compensation for each individual other than Mr. Musk was as follows:

•

We determined that as of December 31, 2020, Tesla and all of our subsidiaries had 68,854 individuals qualifying for this analysis (full-time, part-time and temporary employees other than Mr. Musk, subject to the following bullet), of which approximately 33% were based outside of the U.S. and approximately 35% were production line employees.

•

We did not include in the population of qualifying individuals any employees of staffing agencies whose compensation is determined by such agencies.

•

We applied the requirements and assumptions required for the table under “Summary Compensation Table” above for each of such individuals as if he or she was a named executive officer to calculate the total annual compensation, including base salary or wages, performance-based commission payments, and equity awards based on their grant date fair values.

•

We converted any payment earned or paid in a foreign currency to U.S. dollar using the average of the prevailing conversion rates for the month of December 2020.

•

We selected the median of all total annual compensation amounts calculated in accordance with the foregoing.

Potential Payments Upon Termination or Change in Control

We do not have an employment agreement for any specific term with any of our named executive officers. Moreover, we do not have any contract, agreement, plan or arrangement that would result in payments to a named executive officer at, following, or in connection with any termination of employment, including resignation, severance, retirement or a constructive termination of employment of a named executive officer, or a change in control of Tesla (other than the vesting of the 2018 CEO Performance Award based solely upon the achievement of market capitalization milestones as measured at the time of a change in control of Tesla, which by its nature cannot be estimated at this time) or a change in the named executive officer’s responsibilities. See also “Compensation Discussion and Analysis—Chief Executive Officer Compensation—2018 CEO Performance Award” under this Item 11 above.

Employee Compensation Risks

The Compensation Committee oversees management of risks relating to Tesla’s compensation plans and programs. Tesla’s management and the Compensation Committee have assessed the risks associated with Tesla’s compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers. These include risks relating to setting ambitious targets for our employees’ compensation or the vesting of their equity awards and our emphasis on at-risk equity-based compensation, and the potential impact of such practices on the retention or decision-making of our employees, particularly our senior management. Based on the results of this assessment, Tesla does not believe that its compensation policies and practices for all employees, including non-executive officers, create risks that are reasonably likely to have a material adverse effect on Tesla.

Compensation of Directors

2020 Director Compensation Table

The following table provides information concerning the compensation paid by us to each of our non-employee directors who served during any part of fiscal year 2020. Elon Musk, who is a named executive officer, does not receive additional compensation for his services as a director.

The awards with respect to which values are provided under the column “Option Awards” below are exclusively stock options, which have realizable value only if they actually vest over time and to the extent, if any, that our stock price exceeds the applicable exercise prices. The values provided below for these awards are based on applicable accounting standards, and do not necessarily reflect the actual amounts realized or realizable pursuant to the underlying stock options.

Reflects the aggregate grant date fair value computed in accordance with ASC Topic 718. The assumptions used in the valuation of option awards are set forth in the notes to our consolidated financial statements, which are included in Note 14, Equity Incentive Plans, to the consolidated financial statements included in the Original Form 10-K. These amounts do not necessarily correspond to the actual value that may be recognized by our non-employee directors, which depends, among other things, on the market value of our common stock appreciating from that on the grant date(s) of the option(s). Following vesting, the actual receipt of any shares by each recipient will further be subject to his or her payment of the applicable exercise price.

Non-Employee Director Compensation Arrangements

Overview and Philosophy

Our director compensation policy that is applicable to all of Tesla’s non-employee directors is designed to be consistent with our compensation philosophy for our employees, with an emphasis on equity-based compensation over cash in order to align the value of their compensation with the market value of our stock, and consequently, with the long-term interests of our stockholders. Moreover, while we offer to our employees restricted stock units, which tend to retain some value even if the market value of our stock decreases, the equity-based compensation to our directors is exclusively in the form of stock options, which have value only to the extent, if any, that our stock price increases following their grant. Conversely, fluctuating stock prices have at times resulted in 100% of the vested stock options then held by each of our non-employee directors being out-of-the-money. Consequently, a large portion of our non-employee directors’ compensation is entirely at risk.

Outside Director Compensation Policy

Our current director compensation policy provides that each non-employee director will receive the following compensation for Board and Board committee services, as applicable. Historically, automatically granted stock option awards for such services were made only once every three years, vesting in equal monthly tranches over such period. In February 2020, the Board amended the director compensation policy with prospective effectiveness, such that future stock option awards to purchase one-third of the previously applicable numbers of shares would be automatically granted annually, in lieu of such triennial grants. The policy currently provides for the following compensation, which reflects the foregoing as well as the Stock Split:

•

an annual cash retainer for general Board service of $20,000;

•

no cash awards for attendance of general Board meetings;

•

an annual cash retainer for serving as the chair of the Audit Committee of $15,000, for serving as the chair of the Compensation Committee of $10,000 and for serving as the chair of the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of $7,500;

•

an annual cash retainer for serving on the Audit Committee of $7,500 per member, for serving on the Compensation Committee of $5,000 per member, and for serving on the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee of $5,000 per member;

•

upon first joining the Board, an automatic initial grant of a stock option to purchase a number of shares of our common stock equal to 6,945 multiplied by the number of months (rounded up to a whole number) between the date on which such director joined the Board and the first June 18 following such date (the “Initial Annual Award Grant Date”), vesting 100% on the Initial Annual Award Grant Date (subject to continued service through such date);

21

•

(i) on the Initial Annual Award Grant Date, or for a director who was previously granted an outstanding stock option for Board service to purchase 250,000 shares of our common stock vesting monthly over three years, the date on which such award fully vests, and (ii) in either case every year thereafter, an automatic grant of a stock option to purchase 83,340 shares of our common stock;

•

for serving as the lead independent director, (i) shortly following appointment as the lead independent director, or for a director who was previously granted an outstanding stock option for such service to purchase 120,000 shares of our common stock vesting monthly over three years, the date on which such award fully vests, and (ii) in either case every year thereafter, an automatic grant of a stock option to purchase 40,000 shares of our common stock;

•

for serving as a member of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, (i) shortly following appointment as a member of such Committee, or for a director who was previously granted an outstanding stock option for such service to purchase 60,000 shares, 45,000 shares, or 30,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock vesting monthly over three years, the date on which such award fully vests, and (ii) in either case every year thereafter, an automatic grant of a stock option to purchase 20,000 shares, 15,000 shares, or 10,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock; and

•

in addition to any applicable grant in the immediately preceding bullet, for serving as the chair of the Audit Committee, the Compensation Committee or the Nominating and Corporate Governance Committee, (i) shortly following appointment as the chair of such Committee, or for a director who was previously granted an outstanding stock option for such service to purchase 60,000 shares, 30,000 shares, or 15,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock vesting monthly over three years, the date on which such award fully vests, and (ii) in either case every year thereafter, an automatic grant of a stock option to purchase 20,000 shares, 10,000 shares, or 5,000 shares, respectively, of our common stock.

Unless noted above, each automatic stock option grant for service as a member of the Board, lead independent director, member of a Board committee or chair of a Board committee, in each case as described above, will vest in equal monthly tranches over one year (or, for awards granted prior to the amendment of the director compensation policy in February 2020, over three years) starting on the one month anniversary of the vesting commencement date, subject to continued service in the capacity for which such grant was made (except that if a director who was granted such an option ceases to be a director on the day before an annual meeting that is held earlier than the anniversary date of the vesting commencement date for that calendar year, vesting will accelerate with respect to the shares that would have vested if such director continued service through such anniversary date).

Our director compensation policy also provides that the earning and payment of cash retainer payments payable to outside directors may be waived in whole or part at the election of the director. 

Chair of the Board Compensation

In addition, the Board previously approved the following additional compensation arrangements for Robyn Denholm for her service as Chair of the Board, commencing on July 1, 2019:

•

an annual cash retainer of $300,000; and

•

an automatic annual grant of a stock option to purchase 8,000 shares of our common stock, which will vest 1/12th per month for 12 months starting on the one month anniversary of the vesting commencement date, subject to Ms. Denholm’s continued service as Chair of the Board (except that if Ms. Denholm ceases to be a director on the day before an annual meeting that is held earlier than the anniversary date of the vesting commencement date, vesting will accelerate with respect to the shares that would have vested if she had continued service through such anniversary date).

22

From July 2020, Ms. Denholm requested that Tesla eliminate the future payment to her of all cash retainer amounts for service on the Board, as its Chair and on the various committees of the Board, citing a desire in her Board leadership role to have 100% of her compensation at risk and aligned with the interests of stockholders. Moreover, in consideration of the significant impact on travel and other circumstances resulting from the global COVID-19 pandemic, Ms. Denholm also requested that the grant of her automatic annual stock option award in 2020 for service as Chair of the Board be deferred.

Other Information

If, following a change in control of Tesla, the service of a non-employee director is terminated, all stock options granted to the director pursuant to the compensation policy shall fully vest and become immediately exercisable.

Non-employee directors may also have their travel, lodging and related expenses associated with attending Board or Board committee meetings reimbursed by Tesla.

Pledging of Shares

The ability of our directors and executive officers to pledge Tesla stock for personal loans and investments is inherently related to their compensation due to our use of equity awards and promotion of long-termism and an ownership culture. Moreover, providing these individuals flexibility in financial planning without having to rely on the sale of shares aligns their interests with those of our stockholders.

In order to mitigate the risk of forced sales of pledged shares, the Board has a policy that limits pledging of Tesla stock by our directors and executive officers. Pursuant to this policy, directors and executive officers may pledge their stock (exclusive of options, warrants, restricted stock units or other rights to purchase stock) as collateral for loans and investments, provided that the maximum aggregate loan or investment amount collateralized by such pledged stock does not exceed twenty-five percent (25%) of the total value of the pledged stock.

Example: A director pledges 1,000 shares as collateral for a loan, and the current stock price is $800 per share. The director may borrow up to 25% of 1,000 x $800, or $200,000, against such shares. If the stock price later increases to $1,600 per share, the director may borrow up to an additional $200,000 against the pledged shares. If the director borrows the full allowable amount of $400,000 and the stock price then decreases to $1,200, the director must repay $100,000 to maintain compliance with the 25% limit under the pledging policy.

See “Security Ownership of Certain Beneficial Owners and Management and Related Stockholder Matters—Ownership of Securities” under Item 12 below for information regarding any shares pledged by our directors or executive officers as of December 31, 2020; however, such pledging does not indicate the extent to which there may be actual borrowings against such shares as of such date. Tesla management monitors compliance with this policy by reviewing and, if necessary, reporting to the Board or its committees the extent to which any officer or director has pledged shares of Company stock. We believe that this monitoring is effective and includes appropriate controls, and we have confirmed that each of our directors and executive officers who have pledged stock are and have been compliant with this policy since our last confirmation.

Compensation Committee Interlocks and Insider Participation

Robyn Denholm, Ira Ehrenpreis and Kathleen Wilson-Thompson served as members of the Compensation Committee during 2020. None of such persons is or was formerly an officer or an employee of Tesla. During 2020, no interlocking relationships existed between any member of Tesla’s Board or Compensation Committee and any member of the board of directors or compensation committee of any other company.
