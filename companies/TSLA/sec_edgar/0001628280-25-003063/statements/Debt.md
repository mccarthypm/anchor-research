(1) There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes
with respect to any available committed funds under our RCF Credit Agreement, 
except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down. Refer to the section 
below for the terms of the facility.

(2) The contractual maturity date of the China Working Capital Facility is April
2025, renewable until March 2026 at our discretion. As we have the intent and 
ability to refinance the loan on a long-term basis, we recorded it in Debt and 
finance leases, net of current portion in the consolidated balance sheets.

Recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to our general assets. 
Non-recourse debt refers to debt that is recourse to only assets of our 
subsidiaries. The differences between the unpaid principal balances and the net 
carrying values are due to debt discounts or deferred issuance costs. As of 
December 31, 2024, we were in material compliance with all financial debt 
covenants.

2024 Notes

During the second quarter of 2024, the 2024 Notes reached maturity and were 
fully settled. Additionally, in 2024, we fully settled the warrants entered into
in connection with the issuance of the 2024 Notes, resulting in the issuance of 
11.4 million shares of our common stock.

Credit Agreement

In January 2023, we entered into a 5-year senior unsecured revolving credit 
facility (the “RCF Credit Agreement”) with a syndicate of banks. The RCF Credit 
Agreement contains two optional one-year extensions and has a total commitment 
of up to $5.00 billion, which could be increased up to $7.00 billion under 
certain circumstances. The underlying borrowings may be used for general 
corporate purposes. Borrowed funds accrue interest at a variable rate equal to: 
(i) for dollar-denominated loans, at our election, (a) Term SOFR (the 
forward-looking secured overnight financing rate) plus 0.10%, or (b) an 
alternate base rate; (ii) for loans denominated in pounds sterling, SONIA (the 
sterling overnight index average reference rate); or (iii) for loans denominated
in euros, an adjusted EURIBOR (euro interbank offered rate); in each case, plus 
an applicable margin. The applicable margin will be based on the rating assigned
to our senior, unsecured long-term indebtedness (the “Credit Rating”) from time 
to time. The fee for undrawn amounts is variable based on the Credit Rating and 
is currently 0.125% per annum.

Automotive Asset-backed Notes

From time to time, we transfer receivables and/or beneficial interests related 
to certain vehicles (either leased or financed) into special purpose entities 
(“SPEs”) and issue Automotive Asset-backed Notes, backed by these automotive 
assets to investors. The SPEs are consolidated in the financial statements. The 
cash flows generated by these automotive assets are used to service the 
principal and interest payments on the Automotive Asset-backed Notes and satisfy
the SPEs’ expenses, and any remaining cash is distributed to the owners of the 
SPEs. We recognize revenue earned from the associated customer lease or 
financing contracts in accordance with our revenue recognition policy. The SPEs’
assets and cash flows are not available to our other creditors, and the 
creditors of the SPEs, including the Automotive Asset-backed Note holders, have 
no recourse to our other assets.

In 2024, we transferred beneficial interests related to certain leased vehicles 
and/or financing receivables into SPEs and issued $2.45 billion in aggregate 
principal amount of Automotive Asset-backed Notes, with terms similar to our 
other previously issued Automotive Asset-backed Notes. The proceeds from the 
issuance, net of debt issuance costs, were $2.44 billion.

Energy Asset-backed Notes

In 2024, we transferred certain financing receivables into an SPE and issued 
$499 million in aggregate principal amount of Energy Asset-backed Notes, backed 
by these financing receivables. The proceeds from issuance, net of debt issuance
costs, were $494 million. The SPE is wholly owned by us and is consolidated in 
the financial statements. The cash flows generated by these financing 
receivables are used to service the principal and interest payments on the 
Energy Asset-backed Notes and satisfy the SPE’s expenses, and any remaining cash
is distributed to us. The SPE’s assets and cash flows are not available to our 
other creditors, and the creditors of the SPE, including the Energy Asset-backed
Notes holders, have no recourse to our other assets.

Cash Equity Debt

In connection with the cash equity financing deals closed in 2016, our 
subsidiaries issued $502 million in aggregate principal amount of debt that 
bears interest at fixed rates. This debt is secured by, among other things, our 
interests in certain financing funds and is non-recourse to our other assets.

China Working Capital Facility

In April 2024, one of our subsidiaries entered into a loan agreement (the “China
Working Capital Facility”) with lenders in China for an unsecured revolving 
facility of up to RMB 20.00 billion to be used for certain production 
expenditures as well as repayment of certain finance facilities. Borrowed funds 
bear interest at a rate equal to the Loan Prime Rate published by the People’s 
Bank of China minus 1.18%. The China Working Capital Facility is non-recourse to
our assets.

Pledged Assets

As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had pledged or restricted $5.16 billion and
$4.64 billion of our assets (consisting principally of operating lease vehicles,
financing receivables, restricted cash, and equity interests in certain SPEs) as
collateral for our outstanding debt.
