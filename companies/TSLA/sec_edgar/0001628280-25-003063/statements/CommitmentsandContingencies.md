Operating Lease Arrangement in Buffalo, New York

We have an operating lease arrangement through the Research Foundation for the 
SUNY Foundation with respect to Gigafactory New York. Under the lease and a 
related research and development agreement, we are continuing to further develop
the facility.

Under this agreement, we are obligated to, among other things, meet employment 
targets as well as specified minimum numbers of personnel in the State of New 
York and in Buffalo, New York and spend or incur $5.00 billion in combined 
capital, operational expenses, costs of goods sold and other costs in the State 
of New York during the 10-year period beginning April 30, 2018. On an annual 
basis during the initial lease term, as measured on each anniversary of such 
date, if we fail to meet these specified investment and job creation 
requirements, it may result in our incurring financial liabilities in the form 
of “program payments” which would not be expected to have a material adverse 
effect to our financial operations, the termination of our lease at Gigafactory 
New York, and/or the need to adjust certain of our operations.

In 2021, an amendment was executed to extend our overall agreement to spend or 
incur $5.00 billion in combined capital, operational expenses, costs of goods 
sold and other costs in the State of New York through December 31, 2029. As of 
December 31, 2024, we have met and expect to meet the requirements under this 
arrangement, as may be modified and discussed from time to time, based on our 
current and anticipated level of operations.

Operating Lease Arrangement in Shanghai, China

We have an operating lease arrangement for an initial term of 50 years with the 
local government of Shanghai for land use rights where we have been constructing
Gigafactory Shanghai. Under the terms of the arrangement, we are required to 
spend RMB 14.08 billion in capital expenditures by the end of 2023, which was 
achieved in 2023, and to generate RMB 2.23 billion of annual tax revenues 
starting at the end of 2023. As of December 31, 2024 and 2023, we had met and 
expect to meet the tax revenue requirements based on our current level of spend 
and sales.

Legal Proceedings

Litigation Relating to 2018 CEO Performance Award

On June 4, 2018, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a putative class and 
derivative action in the Delaware Court of Chancery against Elon Musk and the 
members of Tesla’s board of directors as then constituted, alleging corporate 
waste, unjust enrichment and that such board members breached their fiduciary 
duties by approving the stock-based compensation plan awarded to Elon Musk in 
2018 (the “2018 CEO Performance Award”). Trial was held November 14-18, 2022. On
January 30, 2024, the Court issued an opinion finding that the 2018 CEO 
Performance Award should be rescinded. Plaintiff’s counsel filed a brief seeking
a fee award of 29,402,900 Tesla shares, plus expenses of $1,120,115.50. Tesla 
opposed the fee request, and at Tesla’s 2024 Annual Meeting of Stockholders, 72%
of the disinterested voting shares of Tesla, excluding shares owned by Mr. Musk 
and Kimbal Musk, voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award. Because Tesla’s
disinterested stockholders voted to ratify the 2018 CEO Performance Award, Mr. 
Musk and the other director defendants, joined by Tesla, filed a brief seeking 
to revise the Court’s January 30, 2024 opinion. On December 2, 2024, the Court 
issued an opinion denying the motion to revise the Court’s January 30, 2024 
opinion and awarded Plaintiff’s counsel fees in the amount of $345 million. A 
final judgment was entered by the Court, and the director defendants and Tesla 
appealed the decisions to the Delaware Supreme Court.

Litigation Related to Directors’ Compensation

On June 17, 2020, a purported Tesla stockholder filed a derivative action in the
Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against certain of 
Tesla’s current and former directors regarding compensation awards granted to 
Tesla’s directors, other than Elon Musk, between 2017 and 2020. The suit asserts
claims for breach of fiduciary duty and unjust enrichment and seeks declaratory 
and injunctive relief, unspecified damages and other relief. Defendants filed 
their answer on September 17, 2020.

On July 14, 2023, the parties filed a Stipulation and Agreement of Compromise 
and Settlement, which does not involve an admission of any wrongdoing by any 
party. Pursuant to the terms of the agreement, Tesla provided notice of the 
proposed settlement to stockholders of record as of July 14, 2023. The Court 
held a hearing regarding the settlement on October 13, 2023, after which it took
the settlement and plaintiff counsels’ fee request under advisement. On January 
8, 2025, the Court approved the settlement and awarded Plaintiff’s counsel fees 
in the amount of approximately $176 million. A final judgment was entered by the
Court on January 13, 2025. Tesla intends to appeal the Court’s fee award on or 
before the appeal deadline of February 12, 2025. The settlement is not expected 
to have an adverse impact on our results of operations, cash flows or financial 
position.

Litigation Relating to Potential Going Private Transaction

Between August 10, 2018 and September 6, 2018, nine purported stockholder class 
actions were filed against Tesla and Elon Musk in connection with Mr. Musk’s 
August 7, 2018 Twitter post that he was considering taking Tesla private. On 
January 16, 2019, Plaintiffs filed their consolidated complaint in the United 
States District Court for the Northern District of California and added as 
defendants the members of Tesla’s board of directors. The consolidated complaint
asserts claims for violations of the federal securities laws and seeks 
unspecified damages and other relief. The parties stipulated to certification of
a class of stockholders, which the court granted on November 25, 2020. Trial 
started on January 17, 2023, and on February 3, 2023, a jury rendered a verdict 
in favor of the defendants on all counts. After trial, plaintiffs filed a motion
for judgment as a matter of law and a motion for new trial, which the Court 
denied and judgement was entered in favor of defendants on July 11, 2023. On 
November 6, 2024, the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit 
affirmed the district court’s dismissal of all claims.

Between October 17, 2018 and March 8, 2021, seven derivative lawsuits were filed
in the Delaware Court of Chancery, purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Mr. 
Musk and the members of Tesla’s board of directors, as constituted at relevant 
times, in relation to statements made and actions connected to a potential going
private transaction, with certain of the lawsuits challenging additional Twitter
posts by Mr. Musk, among other things. Several of those actions were 
consolidated, and all have been stayed. In addition to these cases, two 
derivative lawsuits were filed on October 25, 2018 and February 11, 2019 in the 
U. S. District Court for the District of Delaware, purportedly on behalf of 
Tesla, against Mr. Musk and the members of the Tesla board of directors as then 
constituted. Those cases have also been consolidated and stayed.

On October 21, 2022, a lawsuit was filed in the Delaware Court of Chancery by a 
purported shareholder of Tesla alleging, among other things, that board members 
breached their fiduciary duties in connection with their oversight of the 
Company’s 2018 settlement with the SEC, as amended. Among other things, the 
plaintiff seeks reforms to the Company’s corporate governance and internal 
procedures, unspecified damages, and attorneys’ fees. The lawsuit has been 
stayed pending resolution of a motion to consolidate certain derivative lawsuits
in the Delaware Court of Chancery referenced below.

On November 15, 2021, JPMorgan Chase Bank filed a lawsuit against Tesla in the 
Southern District of New York alleging breach of a stock warrant agreement that 
was entered into as part of a convertible notes offering in 2014. Tesla denied 
any wrongdoing and filed multiple counterclaims. On November 27, 2024, the 
parties agreed to settle their claims.

Certain Derivative Lawsuits in Delaware

Before converting from a Delaware to Texas corporation on June 13, 2024, three 
separate derivative actions brought by purported Tesla stockholders were filed 
in the Delaware Court of Chancery on May 24, June 10 and June 13, 2024, 
purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against current and former directors regarding 
topics involving Elon Musk and others, X Corp. (formerly Twitter) and x. AI. 
These suits assert various claims, including breach of fiduciary duty and breach
of contract, and seek unspecified damages and other relief. On August 6, 2024, 
the plaintiffs in these three actions moved to consolidate the matters into a 
single case. The Court consolidated two of the three cases.

Litigation and Investigations Relating to Alleged Discrimination and Harassment

On February 9, 2022, the California Civil Rights Department (“CRD,” formerly 
“DFEH”) filed a civil complaint against Tesla in Alameda County, California 
Superior Court, alleging systemic race discrimination, hostile work environment 
and pay equity claims, among others. CRD’s amended complaint seeks monetary 
damages and injunctive relief. The case is currently in discovery. Trial is 
scheduled for September 15, 2025.

Additionally, on June 1, 2022 the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission 
(“EEOC”) issued a cause finding against Tesla that closely parallels the CRD’s 
allegations. On September 28, 2023, the EEOC filed a civil complaint against 
Tesla in the United States District Court for the Northern District of 
California asserting claims for race harassment and retaliation and seeking, 
among other things, monetary and injunctive relief.

On June 16, 2022, two Tesla stockholders filed separate derivative actions in 
the U. S. District Court for the Western District of Texas, purportedly on 
behalf of Tesla, against certain of Tesla’s current and former directors. Both 
suits assert claims for breach of fiduciary duty, unjust enrichment, and 
violation of the federal securities laws in connection with alleged race and 
gender discrimination and sexual harassment. Among other things, plaintiffs seek
declaratory and injunctive relief, unspecified damages payable to Tesla, and 
attorneys’ fees. On July 22, 2022, the Court consolidated the two cases and on 
September 6, 2022, plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint. On November 7, 
2022, the defendants filed a motion to dismiss the case and on September 15, 
2023, the Court dismissed the action but granted plaintiffs leave to file an 
amended complaint. On November 2, 2023, plaintiff filed an amended complaint 
purportedly on behalf of Tesla, against Elon Musk. On December 19, 2023, the 
defendants moved to dismiss the amended complaint, which the Court granted on 
April 12, 2024, with leave for plaintiffs to amend. On May 15, 2024, plaintiffs 
filed a second amended consolidated complaint purportedly on behalf of Tesla, 
against Mr. Musk. On July 1, 2024, the defendants moved to dismiss the second 
amended consolidated complaint.

Other Litigation Related to Our Products and Services

We are also subject to various lawsuits that seek monetary and other injunctive 
relief. These lawsuits include proposed class actions and other consumer claims 
that allege, among other things, purported defects and misrepresentations 
related to our products and services. For example, on September 14, 2022, a 
proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. and related entities in the 
U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California, alleging various 
claims about the Company’s driver assistance technology systems under state and 
federal law. This case was later consolidated with several other proposed class 
actions, and a Consolidated Amended Complaint was filed on October 28, 2022, 
which seeks damages and other relief on behalf of all persons who purchased or 
leased from Tesla between January 1, 2016, to the present. On October 5, 2022, a
proposed class action complaint was filed in the U. S. District Court for the 
Eastern District of New York asserting similar state and federal law claims 
against the same defendants. On September 30, 2023, the Court dismissed this 
action with leave to amend the complaint. On November 20, 2023, the plaintiff 
moved to amend the complaint, which Tesla opposed. On August 8, 2024, the Court 
denied the plaintiff’s motion for leave to file an amended complaint and entered
judgment for Tesla. On September 5, 2024, the plaintiff filed a notice of appeal
to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit, and the parties are 
briefing the matter. On March 22, 2023, the plaintiffs in the Northern District 
of California consolidated action filed a motion for a preliminary injunction to
order Tesla to (1) cease using the term “Full Self-Driving Capability” (FSD 
Capability), (2) cease the sale and activation of FSD Capability and deactivate 
FSD Capability on Tesla vehicles, and (3) provide certain notices to consumers 
about proposed court-findings about the accuracy of the use of the terms 
Autopilot and FSD Capability. Tesla opposed the motion. On September 30, 2023, 
the Court denied the request for a preliminary injunction, compelled four of 
five plaintiffs to arbitration, and dismissed the claims of the fifth plaintiff 
with leave to amend the complaint. On October 31, 2023, the remaining plaintiff 
in the Northern District of California action filed an amended complaint, which 
Tesla moved to dismiss, and on May 15, 2024, the Court granted in part and 
denied in part Tesla’s motion. On October 2, 2023, a similar proposed class 
action was filed in San Diego County Superior Court in California. Tesla 
subsequently removed the San Diego County case to federal court and on January 
8, 2024, the federal court granted Tesla’s motion to transfer the case to the U.
S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Tesla moved to compel
arbitration, which the plaintiff did not oppose, and on June 27, 2024, the Court
stayed the case pending arbitration.

On February 27, 2023, a proposed class action was filed in the U. S. District 
Court for the Northern District of California against Tesla, Inc., Elon Musk and
certain current and former Company executives. The complaint alleges that the 
defendants made material misrepresentations and omissions about the Company’s 
Autopilot and FSD Capability technologies and seeks money damages and other 
relief on behalf of persons who purchased Tesla stock between February 19, 2019,
and February 17, 2023. An amended complaint was filed on September 5, 2023, 
naming only Tesla, Inc. and Elon Musk as defendants. On November 6, 2023, Tesla 
moved to dismiss the amended complaint. On September 30, 2024, the Court granted
Tesla’s motion to dismiss without prejudice. On November 26, 2024, the court 
issued a final judgment in Tesla’s favor, and on December 23, 2024, the 
plaintiffs filed a notice of appeal to the United States Court of Appeals for 
the Ninth Circuit.

On March 14, 2023, a proposed class action was filed against Tesla, Inc. in the 
U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California. Several similar 
complaints were also filed in the same court and these cases have now all been 
consolidated. These complaints allege that Tesla violates federal antitrust and 
warranty laws through its repair, service, and maintenance practices and seeks, 
among other relief, damages for persons who paid Tesla for repairs services or 
Tesla compatible replacement parts from March 2019 to March 2023. On July 17, 
2023, these plaintiffs filed a consolidated amended complaint. On September 27, 
2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to compel arbitration as to three of the 
plaintiffs, and on November 17, 2023, the court granted Tesla’s motion to 
dismiss without prejudice. The plaintiffs filed a Consolidated Second Amended 
Complaint on December 12, 2023, which Tesla moved to dismiss. Plaintiffs also 
appealed the court’s arbitration order, which was denied. On June 17, 2024, the 
Court granted in part and denied in part Tesla’s motion to dismiss the 
Consolidated Second Amended Complaint.

The Company intends to vigorously defend itself in these matters; however, we 
cannot predict the outcome or impact. We are unable to reasonably estimate the 
possible loss or range of loss, if any, associated with these claims, unless 
noted.

Certain Investigations and Other Matters

We regularly receive requests for information, including subpoenas, from 
regulators and governmental authorities such as the National Highway Traffic 
Safety Administration, the National Transportation Safety Board, the Securities 
and Exchange Commission (“SEC”), the Department of Justice (“DOJ”), and various 
local, state, federal, and international agencies. The ongoing requests for 
information include topics such as operations, technology (e. g., vehicle 
functionality, vehicle incidents, Autopilot and FSD Capability), compliance, 
finance, data privacy, and other matters related to Tesla’s business, its 
personnel, and related parties. We routinely cooperate with such formal and 
informal requests for information, investigations, and other inquiries. To our 
knowledge no government agency in any ongoing investigation has concluded that 
any wrongdoing occurred. We cannot predict the outcome or impact of any ongoing 
matters. Should the government decide to pursue an enforcement action, there 
exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on our business, results of 
operation, prospects, cash flows, financial position or brand.

We are also subject to various other legal proceedings, risks and claims that 
arise from the normal course of business activities. For example, during the 
second quarter of 2023, a foreign news outlet reported that it obtained certain 
misappropriated data including, purportedly non-public Tesla business and 
personal information. Tesla has made notifications to potentially affected 
individuals (current and former employees) and regulatory authorities and we are
working with certain law enforcement and other authorities. On August 5, 2023, a
putative class action was filed in the United States District Court for the 
Northern District of California, purportedly on behalf of all U. S. individuals 
impacted by the data incident, followed by several additional lawsuits, that 
each assert claims under various state laws and seeks monetary damages and other
relief. If an unfavorable ruling or development were to occur in these or other 
possible legal proceedings, risks and claims, there exists the possibility of a 
material adverse impact on our business, results of operations, prospects, cash 
flows, financial position or brand.

Letters of Credit

As of December 31, 2024, we had $448 million of unused letters of credit 
outstanding.
