In June 2019, we adopted the 2019 Equity Incentive Plan (the “2019 Plan”). The 
2019 Plan provides for the grant of stock options, restricted stock, RSUs, stock
appreciation rights, performance units and performance shares to our employees, 
directors and consultants. Stock options granted under the 2019 Plan may be 
either incentive stock options or nonstatutory stock options. Incentive stock 
options may only be granted to our employees. Nonstatutory stock options may be 
granted to our employees, directors and consultants. Generally, our stock 
options and RSUs vest over four years and our stock options are exercisable over
a maximum period of 10 years from their grant dates. Vesting typically 
terminates when the employment or consulting relationship ends.

As of December 31, 2024, 113.0 million shares were reserved and available for 
issuance under the 2019 Plan.

The following table summarizes our stock option and RSU activity for the year 
ended December 31, 2024:

The weighted-average grant date fair value per share of RSUs granted in the 
years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $223.98, $228.33 and $239.85, 
respectively. The aggregate release date fair value of RSUs in the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022 was $1.75 billion, $2.50 billion and $4.32 
billion, respectively.

The aggregate intrinsic value of options exercised during the years ended 
December 31, 2024, 2023, and 2022 was $1.77 billion, $1.33 billion and $1.90 
billion, respectively.

ESPP

Our employees are eligible to purchase our common stock through payroll 
deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation, subject to any plan 
limitations. The purchase price would be 85% of the lower of the fair market 
value on the first and last trading days of each six-month offering period. 
During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, under the ESPP we 
issued 2.2 million, 2.1 million and 1.4 million shares, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2024, there were 95.5 million shares available for issuance under 
the ESPP.

Fair Value Assumptions

We use the fair value method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. 
Under the fair value method, we estimate the fair value of each stock option 
award with service or service and performance conditions and the ESPP on the 
grant date generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The 
weighted-average assumptions used in the Black-Scholes model for stock options 
are as follows:

The fair value of RSUs with service or service and performance conditions is 
measured on the grant date based on the closing fair market value of our common 
stock. The risk-free interest rate is based on the U. S. Treasury yield for 
zero-coupon U. S. Treasury notes with maturities approximating each grant’s 
expected life. We use our historical data in estimating the expected term of our
employee grants. The expected volatility is based on the average of the implied 
volatility of publicly traded options for our common stock and the historical 
volatility of our common stock.

Other Performance-Based Grants

From time to time, the Compensation Committee of our Board of Directors grants 
certain employees performance-based RSUs and stock options.

As of December 31, 2024, we had unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of
$490 million under these grants to purchase or receive an aggregate 5.0 million 
shares of our common stock. For awards probable of achievement, we estimate the 
unrecognized stock-based compensation expense of $421 million will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 4.0 years.

For the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 2022, stock-based compensation 
expense related to these grants, net of forfeitures, were not material.

Our income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation arrangements 
were immaterial while we were under full valuation allowances on our U. S. 
deferred tax assets during the year ended December 31, 2022. With the release of
the valuation allowance associated with our federal and certain state deferred 
tax assets in 2023, income tax benefits recognized from stock-based compensation
expense during the years ended December 31, 2024 and 2023 were $371 million and 
$326 million, respectively. During the years ended December 31, 2024, 2023 and 
2022, stock-based compensation expense capitalized to our consolidated balance 
sheets was $198 million, $199 million and $245 million, respectively. As of 
December 31, 2024, we had $5.79 billion of total unrecognized stock-based 
compensation expense related to non-performance awards, which will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 3.0 years.
