Our Chief Executive Officer, as the CODM, organizes our company, manages 
resource allocations and measures performance among two operating and reportable
segments: (i) automotive and (ii) energy generation and storage. The automotive 
segment includes the design, development, manufacturing, sales and leasing of 
electric vehicles as well as sales of automotive regulatory credits. 
Additionally, the automotive segment is also comprised of services and other, 
which includes sales of used vehicles, non-warranty maintenance services and 
collision, part sales, paid Supercharging, insurance services revenue and retail
merchandise sales. The energy generation and storage segment includes the 
design, manufacture, installation, sales and leasing of solar energy generation 
and energy storage products and related services and sales of solar energy 
systems incentives.

Our CODM does not evaluate operating segments using asset or liability 
information. The CODM uses gross profit to allocate operating and capital 
resources and assesses performance of each segment by comparing actual gross 
profit results to historical results and previously forecasted financial 
information. The following table presents revenues, cost of revenues and gross 
profit by reportable segment (in millions):
