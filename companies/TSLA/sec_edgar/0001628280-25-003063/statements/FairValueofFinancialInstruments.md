ASC 820 states that fair value is an exit price, representing the amount that 
would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly
transaction between market participants. As such, fair value is a market-based 
measurement that should be determined based on assumptions that market 
participants would use in pricing an asset or a liability. The three-tiered fair
value hierarchy, which prioritizes which inputs should be used in measuring fair
value, is comprised of: (Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in 
active markets; (Level II) inputs other than quoted prices in active markets 
that are observable either directly or indirectly and (Level III) unobservable 
inputs for which there is little or no market data. The fair value hierarchy 
requires the use of observable market data when available in determining fair 
value. Our assets and liabilities that were measured at fair value on a 
recurring basis were as follows (in millions):

All of our money market funds and digital assets are classified within Level I 
of the fair value hierarchy because they were valued using quoted prices in 
active markets. Our U. S. government securities, certificates of deposit, 
commercial paper, time deposits and corporate debt securities are classified 
within Level II of the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to 
determine fair value of these investments.

Our cash, cash equivalents and investments classified by security type as of
