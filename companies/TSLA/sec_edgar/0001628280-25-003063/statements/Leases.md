We have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain 
of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service 
locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, 
worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at 
inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease 
commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for 
use by the lessor.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected 
to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components
together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor 
perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production 
equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the 
timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and 
associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for 
separately, would be classified as an operating lease.

We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance 
sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception 
and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably 
certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement
date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we 
used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease 
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease 
term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate 
the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of 
calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or 
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such 
options.

Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature
of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to 
lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of 
future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date 
for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual 
payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is 
recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses 
depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease 
liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the 
consolidated statements of operations.

The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are 
presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheets:

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners 
with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. For 
our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power 
produced by the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per 
kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are 
not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by
the related solar energy systems in the future.

Net Investment in Sales-type Leases

Net investment in sales-type leases, which is the sum of the present value of 
the future contractual lease payments, is presented on the consolidated balance 
sheets as a component of Prepaid expenses and other current assets for the 
current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Lease
receivables relating to sales-type leases are presented on the consolidated

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners 
with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. For 
our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power 
produced by the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per 
kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are 
not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by
the related solar energy systems in the future.

Net Investment in Sales-type Leases

Net investment in sales-type leases, which is the sum of the present value of 
the future contractual lease payments, is presented on the consolidated balance

current portion and as Other non-current assets for the long-term portion. Lease

We have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain 
of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service 
locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, 
worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at 
inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease 
commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for 
use by the lessor.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected 
to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components
together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor 
perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production 
equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the 
timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and 
associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for 
separately, would be classified as an operating lease.

We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance 
sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception 
and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably 
certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement
date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we 
used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease 
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease 
term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate 
the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of 
calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or 
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such 
options.

Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature
of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to 
lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of 
future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date 
for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual 
payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is 
recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses 
depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease 
liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the 
consolidated statements of operations.

The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are 
presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheets:

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners 
with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. For 
our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power 
produced by the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per 
kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are 
not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by
the related solar energy systems in the future.

Net Investment in Sales-type Leases

Net investment in sales-type leases, which is the sum of the present value of 
the future contractual lease payments, is presented on the consolidated balance

We have entered into various operating and finance lease agreements for certain 
of our offices, manufacturing and warehouse facilities, retail and service 
locations, data centers, equipment, vehicles, and solar energy systems, 
worldwide. We determine if an arrangement is a lease, or contains a lease, at 
inception and record the lease in our financial statements upon lease 
commencement, which is the date when the underlying asset is made available for 
use by the lessor.

We have lease agreements with lease and non-lease components, and have elected 
to utilize the practical expedient to account for lease and non-lease components
together as a single combined lease component, from both a lessee and lessor 
perspective with the exception of direct sales-type leases and production 
equipment classes embedded in supply agreements. From a lessor perspective, the 
timing and pattern of transfer are the same for the non-lease components and 
associated lease component and, the lease component, if accounted for 
separately, would be classified as an operating lease.

We have elected not to present short-term leases on the consolidated balance 
sheet as these leases have a lease term of 12 months or less at lease inception 
and do not contain purchase options or renewal terms that we are reasonably 
certain to exercise. All other lease assets and lease liabilities are recognized
based on the present value of lease payments over the lease term at commencement
date. Because most of our leases do not provide an implicit rate of return, we 
used our incremental borrowing rate based on the information available at lease 
commencement date in determining the present value of lease payments.

Our leases, where we are the lessee, often include options to extend the lease 
term for up to 10 years. Some of our leases also include options to terminate 
the lease prior to the end of the agreed upon lease term. For purposes of 
calculating lease liabilities, lease terms include options to extend or 
terminate the lease when it is reasonably certain that we will exercise such 
options.

Lease expense for operating leases is recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses depending on the nature
of the leased asset. Certain operating leases provide for annual increases to 
lease payments based on an index or rate. We calculate the present value of 
future lease payments based on the index or rate at the lease commencement date 
for new leases. Differences between the calculated lease payment and actual 
payment are expensed as incurred. Amortization of finance lease assets is 
recognized over the lease term as cost of revenues or operating expenses 
depending on the nature of the leased asset. Interest expense on finance lease 
liabilities is recognized over the lease term within Interest expense in the 
consolidated statements of operations.

The balances for the operating and finance leases where we are the lessee are 
presented as follows (in millions) within our consolidated balance sheets:

The above table does not include vehicle sales to customers or leasing partners 
with a resale value guarantee as the cash payments were received upfront. For 
our solar PPA arrangements, customers are charged solely based on actual power 
produced by the installed solar energy system at a predefined rate per 
kilowatt-hour of power produced. The future payments from such arrangements are 
not included in the above table as they are a function of the power generated by
the related solar energy systems in the future.
