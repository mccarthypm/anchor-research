(1) There are no restrictions on draw-down or use for general corporate purposes
with respect to any available committed funds under our RCF Credit Agreement, 
except certain specified conditions prior to draw-down. Refer to the section 
below for the terms of the facility.

(2) The contractual maturity date of the China Working Capital Facility is April
2025, renewable until March 2026 at our discretion. As we have the intent and 
ability to refinance the loan on a long-term basis, we recorded it in Debt and 
finance leases, net of current portion in the consolidated balance sheets.
