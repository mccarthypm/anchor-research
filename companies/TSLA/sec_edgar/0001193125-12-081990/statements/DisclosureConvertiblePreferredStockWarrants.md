In March 2006, we issued warrants to purchase 650,882 shares of Series C 
convertible preferred stock in conjunction with the conversion of previously 
issued convertible notes payable into Series C convertible preferred stock. The 
warrants had an exercise price of $1.14 per share and expired on the earlier of 
March 30, 2011 or an IPO. As a result of our IPO which closed on July 2, 2010, 
these warrants were net exercised for 184,359 shares of common stock. The fair 
value of these warrants as of July 2, 2010 in the amount of $3.6 million was 
recorded in equity on the consolidated balance sheet. Through the net exercise 
of the Series C convertible preferred stock warrants in July 2010, we recognized
a charge from the change in the fair value of these warrants during 2010 in the 
amount of $2.6 million through other expense, net, on the consolidated statement
of operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized charges from the change 
in the fair value of these warrants in the amount of $0.7 million through other 
expense, net, on the consolidated statements of operations.

In February 2008, we issued warrants with our February 2008 convertible notes 
payable. The warrants allowed for the purchase of shares of either Series D 
convertible preferred stock at a price of $2.44 per share, which amounted to 
warrants to purchase 8,246,914 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock, 
or the securities issuable in a subsequent round of financing at the per share 
price of such securities.

On December 24, 2008, warrants to purchase 3,439,305 of the shares of Series D 
convertible preferred stock were extinguished as a result of the election of 
certain holders of the February 2008 convertible notes to exchange their notes 
and warrants for December 2008 convertible notes. On the date of the exchange, 
we recognized a gain in the amount of $1.3 million through other expense, net, 
in connection with the extinguishment of these warrants.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, warrants to purchase an additional 
3,967,152 shares of Series D convertible preferred stock were extinguished as a 
result of the election of certain remaining holders of the February 2008 
convertible notes as part of an exchange of their notes and warrants for 
December 2008 convertible notes. On the date of the exchange, we recognized a 
gain in the amount of $1.5 million through other expense, net, in connection 
with the extinguishment of these warrants.

In May 2009, we completed our Series E financing in which $50.0 million of 
proceeds was received for the purchase of 19,901,290 shares of Series E 
convertible preferred stock at a price of $2.51 per share. In connection with 
this financing, the remaining holders of the February 2008 notes and warrants 
converted their notes into shares of Series E convertible preferred stock and 
converted their warrants into warrants to purchase 866,091 shares of Series E 
convertible preferred stock.

As a result of our IPO which closed on July 2, 2010, these warrants which 
exclude the DOE warrant (see Note 9), were net exercised for 160,688 shares of 
common stock. The fair value of these warrants as of July 2, 2010 in the amount 
of $3.4 million was recorded in equity on the consolidated balance sheet. 
Through the net exercise of the Series E convertible preferred stock warrants in
July 2010, we recognized a charge from the change in the fair value of these 
warrants during 2010 in the amount of $2.7 million through other expense, net, 
on the consolidated statement of operations.

During the year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized charges from the change 
in the fair value of these Series E warrants in the amounts of $0.4 million 
through other expense, net, on the consolidated statement of operations.
