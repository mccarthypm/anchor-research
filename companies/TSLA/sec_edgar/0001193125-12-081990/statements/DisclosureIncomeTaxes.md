Management believes that based on the available information, it is more likely 
than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a full 
valuation allowance is required against all U. S. deferred tax assets.

As of December 31, 2011, we had approximately $605 million of federal and $352 
million of California operating loss carry-forwards available to offset future 
taxable income, $21 million of which is associated with windfall tax benefits 
that will be recorded as additional paid-in capital when realized. These 
carryforwards will expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 for federal and 
2019 for state if unused. Additionally, we have research and development tax 
credits of approximately $10.9 million and $11.5 million for federal and state 
income tax purposes, respectively. If not utilized, the federal carry-forwards 
will expire in various amounts beginning in 2019. However, the state credits can
be carried forward indefinitely.

We have indefinitely reinvested $2.2 million of undistributed earnings of our 
foreign operations outside of our U. S. tax jurisdiction as of December 31, 
2011. No deferred tax liability has been recognized for the remittance of such 
earnings to the U. S. since it is our intention to utilize these earnings to 
fund future foreign expansions including but not limited to, hiring of 
additional personnel, capital purchases, expansion into larger facilities, and 
potential new dealerships.

Federal and state laws can impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of
net operating loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an "ownership 
change," as defined in Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code. Prior to our 
IPO, we performed a study and had determined that no significant limitation 
would be placed on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit 
carry-forwards as a result of prior ownership changes. We do not believe that 
our public offerings and private placements constituted an ownership change 
resulting in limitations on our ability to use our net operating loss and tax 
credit carry-forwards; however, we have not yet performed a study subsequent to 
our IPO to determine whether such limitations exist.

Uncertain Tax Positions

Effective January 1, 2007, we adopted new accounting guidance related to the 
recognition, measurement and presentation of uncertain tax positions. As a 
result, we recorded net unrecognized tax benefits of $11.5 million with an 
offset to the deferred tax assets with a full valuation allowance.

The aggregate changes in the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits 
during the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 were as follows (in 
thousands):

Accrued interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are 
classified as income tax expense and was $5,000. As of December 31, 2011, 
unrecognized tax benefits of $17.4 million, if recognized, would not affect our 
effective tax rate as the tax benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which
is currently fully offset with a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate 
that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will significantly 
increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We file income tax returns in 
the United States, California, various states, the United Kingdom and other 
foreign jurisdictions. Tax years 2008 to 2011 remain subject to examination for 
federal purposes, and tax years 2007 to 2011 remain subject to examination for 
California purposes. All net operating losses and tax credits generated to date 
are subject to adjustment for U. S. federal and California purposes. Tax years 
2006 to 2011 remain open for examination in other U. S. state and foreign 
jurisdictions.
