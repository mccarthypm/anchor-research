On January 20, 2010, we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing 
Bank (FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the ATVM Incentive Program. This loan 
facility was amended in June 2011 to expand our cash investment options and in 
February 2012 to modify the timing of certain future financial covenants and 
funding of the debt service reserve account, as detailed below. We refer to the 
loan facility with the DOE, as amended, as the DOE Loan Facility. Under the DOE 
Loan Facility, the FFB has made available to us two multi-draw term loan 
facilities in an aggregate principal amount of up to $465.0 million. Up to an 
aggregate principal amount of $101.2 million will be made available under the 
first term loan facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding 
for the powertrain engineering and the build out of a facility to design and 
manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric components 
(the Powertrain Facility). Up to an aggregate principal amount of $363.9 million
will be made available under the second term loan facility to finance up to 80% 
of the costs eligible for funding for the development of, and to build out the 
manufacturing facility for, our Model S sedan (the Model S Facility). Under the 
DOE Loan Facility, we are responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs 
eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the projects as well as any cost
overruns for each project. The costs paid by us prior to the execution of the 
DOE Loan Facility and related to the Powertrain Facility and the Model S 
Facility will be applied towards our obligation to contribute 20% of the 
eligible project costs, and the DOE's funding of future eligible costs will be 
adjusted to take this into account. Our obligations for the development of, and 
the build-out of our manufacturing facility for, Model S is budgeted to be an 
aggregate of $33 million or approximately 8.5% of the ongoing budgeted cost, 
plus any cost overruns for the projects. We have paid for the full 20% of the 
budgeted costs related to our Powertrain Facility and therefore expect to 
receive 100% reimbursement from the DOE Loan Facility for ongoing budgeted 
costs, but will continue to be responsible for cost overruns. On the closing 
date, we paid a facility fee to the DOE in the amount of $0.5 million.

Our DOE Loan Facility draw-downs were as follows (in thousands):

Our ability to draw down funds under the DOE Loan Facility is conditioned upon 
several draw conditions. We are currently in compliance with these draw 
conditions. For the Powertrain Facility, the draw conditions include our 
achievement of progress milestones relating to the development of the powertrain
manufacturing facility and the successful development of commercial arrangements
with third parties for the supply of powertrain components. For the Model S 
Facility, the draw conditions include our achievement of progress milestones 
relating to the design and development of Model S and the Tesla Factory. Certain
advances will be subject to additional conditions to draw-down related to the 
site on which the applicable project is located. Additionally, the DOE Loan 
Facility provides for the ability to update milestones should a reasonable need 
arise.

Advances under the DOE Loan Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate 
determined by the Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance and 
will be based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal 
installments for such advance. Interest on advances under the DOE Loan Facility 
is payable quarterly in arrears. Advances under the Powertrain Facility are 
repayable in 28 equal quarterly installments commencing on December 15, 2012 (or
for advances made after such date, in 26 equal quarterly installments commencing
on June 15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the Powertrain Facility will be
due and payable on the maturity date of September 15, 2019. Advances under the 
Model S Facility are repayable in 40 equal quarterly installments commencing on 
December 15, 2012 (or for advances made after such date, in 38 equal quarterly 
installments commencing on June 15, 2013). All outstanding amounts under the 
Model S Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date of September 15, 
2022. Advances under the loan facilities may be voluntarily prepaid at any time 
at a price determined based on interest rates at the time of prepayment for 
loans made from the Secretary of the Treasury to FFB for obligations with an 
identical payment schedule to the advance being prepaid, which could result in 
the advance being prepaid at a discount, at par or at a premium. The loan 
facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment with net cash proceeds received 
from certain dispositions, loss events with respect to property and other 
extraordinary receipts. All obligations under the DOE Loan Facility are secured 
by substantially all of our property.

Under the DOE Loan Facility, we have committed to pay all costs and expenses 
incurred to complete the projects being financed in excess of amounts funded 
under the loan facility. We will be required to maintain, at all times, 
available cash and cash equivalents of at least 105% of the amounts required to 
fund this excess over our financing commitment, after taking into account 
current cash flows and cash on hand, and reasonable projections of future 
generation of net cash from operations, losses and expenditures. Loans may be 
requested under the facilities until January 22, 2013, and we have committed to 
complete the projects being financed prior to such date.

The DOE Loan Facility documents contain customary covenants that include, among 
others, a requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the 
business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of the ATVM 
Program, and limitations on our and our subsidiaries' ability to incur 
indebtedness, incur liens, make investments or loans, enter into mergers or 
acquisitions, dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital 
stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees to affiliates,
enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter into new lines of business, and
enter into certain restrictive agreements, in each case subject to customary 
exceptions. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary financial 
covenants requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to current 
liabilities, and (i) through November 30, 2012, a minimum cash balance, (ii) 
after September 30, 2012, a limit on capital expenditures, (iii) after June 30, 
2013, a maximum leverage ratio, a minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum 
fixed charge coverage ratio, and (iv) after March 31, 2014, a maximum ratio of 
total liabilities to shareholder equity. We are in compliance with our current 
applicable financial covenants. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain 
customary events of default, subject in some cases to customary cure periods for
certain defaults. In addition, events of default include a failure of Elon Musk,
our Chief Executive Officer, Product Architect and Chairman, and certain of his 
affiliates, at any time prior to one year after we complete the project relating
to the Model S Facility, to own at least 65% of capital stock held by Mr. Musk 
and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan Facility.

Under the DOE Loan Facility, we have agreed to fund a debt service reserve 
account. On or before February 29, 2012, we have agreed to fund an amount equal 
to all principal and interest that will come due on December 15, 2012, and on or
before October 15, 2012, we have agreed to fund an amount equal to all principal
and interest that will come due on March 15, 2013 and June 15, 2013. Once we 
have deposited such amounts, we will not be required to further fund such debt 
service reserve account.

We have also agreed that, in connection with the sale of our common stock in an 
IPO, at least 75% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us and, in 
connection with the sale of our stock in any other follow-on equity offering, at
least 50% of the net offering proceeds will be received by us. Offering proceeds
may not be used to pay bonuses or other compensation to officers, directors, 
employees or consultants in excess of the amounts contemplated by our business 
plan approved by the DOE.

Upon completion of our IPO in 2010, we set aside $100 million to fund a separate
dedicated account under our DOE Loan Facility. This dedicated account is used by
us to fund any cost overruns for our powertrain and Tesla Factory projects and 
is used as a mechanism to defer advances under the DOE Loan Facility. This will 
not affect our ability to draw down the full amount of the DOE loans, but will 
require us to use the dedicated account to fund certain project costs up front, 
which costs may then be reimbursed by loans under the DOE Loan Facility once the
dedicated account is depleted, or as part of the final advance for the 
applicable project. We will be required to deposit a portion of these 
reimbursements into the dedicated account, in an amount equal to up to 30% of 
the remaining project costs for the applicable project, and these amounts may 
similarly be used by us to fund project costs and cost overruns and will 
similarly be eligible for reimbursement by the draw-down of additional loans 
under the DOE Loan Facility once used in full, or as part of the final advance 
for the applicable project. Depending on the timing and magnitude of our 
draw-downs and the funding requirements of the dedicated account, the balance of
the dedicated account will fluctuate throughout the period in which we plan to 
make draw-downs under the DOE Loan Facility. Upon completion of our final 
advance under the DOE Loan Facility, the balance in the dedicated account will 
be fully transferred out of the dedicated account. As of December 31, 2011 and 
2010, $23.5 million and $73.6 million were held in the dedicated account, 
respectively. As we expect to transfer the remainder of this balance within one 
year, we have classified such cash as current restricted cash on the 
consolidated balance sheet.

DOE Warrant

In connection with the closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we have also issued a 
warrant to the DOE to purchase up to 9,255,035 shares of our Series E 
convertible preferred stock at an exercise price of $2.51 per share. Upon the 
completion of our IPO on July 2, 2010, this preferred stock warrant became a 
warrant to purchase up to 3,090,111 shares of common stock at an exercise price 
of $7.54 per share. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until December 14, 2022, 
the shares subject to purchase under the warrant will vest and become 
exercisable in quarterly amounts depending on the average outstanding balance of
the loan during the prior quarter. The warrant may be exercised until December 
15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in part or in full, the total 
amount of shares exercisable under the warrant will be reduced.

Since the number of shares ultimately issuable under the warrants will vary 
depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual 
vesting period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our future stock 
price as well as the interest rates on our loans in relation to market interest 
rates, we measured the fair value of the warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation 
approach. The Monte Carlo approach simulates and captures the optimal decisions 
to be made between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE 
warrant. For the purposes of the simulation, the optimal decision represents the
scenario with the lowest economic cost to us. The total warrant value would then
be calculated as the average warrant payoff across all simulated paths 
discounted to our valuation date.

The prepayment feature which allows us to prepay the DOE Loan Facility and 
consequently, affect the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE 
warrant, was determined to represent an embedded derivative. This embedded 
derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part of the warrant 
liability on our consolidated balance sheets. Changes to the fair value of the 
embedded derivative are reflected as part of the warrant liability 
re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet reporting date.

The warrant is recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in its fair 
value reflected in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. The fair
value of the warrant at issuance was $6.3 million, and along with the DOE Loan 
Facility fee of $0.5 million and other debt issuance costs of $0.9 million, 
represents a cost of closing the loan facility and is being amortized to 
interest expense over the expected term of the DOE Loan Facility of 
approximately 13 years. During the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we 
amortized $0.6 million and $0.6 million to interest expense, respectively.

Prior to the completion of our IPO, the fair value of the DOE warrant was 
included within the convertible preferred stock warrant liability on the 
consolidated balance sheet. Upon the completion of our IPO on July 2, 2010, this
warrant was reclassified on our consolidated balance sheet from convertible 
preferred stock warrant liability to common stock warrant liability. The DOE 
warrant will continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in
the fair value reflected in other expense, net, as the number of common stock 
ultimately issuable under the warrant is variable until its expiration or 
vesting. As of December 31, 2011 and 2010, the fair value of the DOE warrant was
$8.8 million and $6.1 million, respectively. During the year ended December 31, 
2011, we recognized expense for the change in the fair value of the DOE warrant 
in the amount of $2.8 million through other expense, net, on the consolidated 
statement of operations. During the year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized 
income from the change in the fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of 
$0.2 million through other expense, net, on the consolidated statement of 
operations.
