|   Overview Of The Company | 1. Overview of the Company

Tesla Motors, Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of 
Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and sell 
high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric vehicle 
powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in North America, 
Europe and Asia. The primary purpose of these subsidiaries is to market and/or 
service our vehicles.

Since inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used approximately
$445.0 million of cash in operations through December 31, 2011. As of December 
31, 2011, we had $280.3 million in cash and cash equivalents and short-term 
marketable securities. We are currently selling the Tesla Roadster and are 
developing the Model S sedan which we currently expect to introduce commercially
in 2012. In February 2012, we revealed an early prototype of our Model X 
crossover.

Unadjusted Error in 2009

In June 2010, we identified an error related to the understatement in 
stock-based compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated 
financial statements for the year ended December 31, 2009.

In the fourth quarter of 2009, we granted certain stock options for which a 
portion of the grant was immediately vested. We erroneously accounted for the 
expense on a straight-line basis over the term of the award, while expense 
recognition should always be at least commensurate with the number of awards 
vesting during the period. As a result, selling, general and administrative 
expenses and net loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 were understated by 
$2.7 million. The error did not have an effect on the valuation of the stock 
options. As stock-based compensation expense is a non-cash item, there was no 
impact on net cash used in operating activities for the year ended December 31, 
2009.

To correct this error, we recorded additional stock-based compensation of $2.4 
million in the three months ended June 30, 2010. We considered the impact of the
error on reported operating expenses and trends in operating results and 
determined that the impact of the error was not material to previously reported 
financial information as well as those related to the year ended December 31, 
2010.
