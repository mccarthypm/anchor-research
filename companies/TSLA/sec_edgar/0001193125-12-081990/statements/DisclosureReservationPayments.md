| **  Reservation Payments** | 6. Reservation Payments

Reservation payments consist of payments that allow potential customers to hold 
a reservation for the future purchase of a Tesla Roadster or Model S. These 
amounts are recorded as current liabilities until the vehicle is delivered. For 
our Tesla Roadsters manufactured to specification, our current purchase 
agreement requires the payment of an initial nonrefundable deposit which varies 
based on the country of purchase. For Model S, we require an initial refundable 
reservation payment of at least $5,000. For Tesla Roadsters purchased directly 
from our showrooms, no deposit is required. Prior to the three months ended June
30, 2010, our reservation policy was to accept refundable reservation payments 
from all customers who wished to purchase a Tesla Roadster and require full 
payment of the purchase price of the vehicle at the time the customer selected 
their vehicle specifications. During the three months ended June 30, 2010, we 
changed our policy to require nonrefundable deposits for Tesla Roadsters 
manufactured to specification at the time a customer enters into a purchase 
agreement. However, we also occasionally accept refundable reservation payments 
for the Tesla Roadster if a customer is interested in purchasing a vehicle but 
not yet prepared to select the vehicle specifications. For customers who have 
placed a refundable reservation payment with us, the reservation payment becomes
a nonrefundable deposit once the customer has selected the vehicle 
specifications and enters into a purchase agreement. We require full payment of 
the purchase price of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the 
customer. Amounts received by us as reservation payments are generally not 
restricted as to their use by us. Upon delivery of the vehicle, the related 
reservation payments are applied against the customer's total purchase price for
the vehicle and recognized in automotive sales as part of the respective vehicle
sale.

As of December 31, 2011, we held reservation payments for undelivered Model S 
sedans in an aggregate amount of $90.0 million and payments for Tesla Roadsters 
in an aggregate amount of $1.8 million. As of December 31, 2010, we held 
reservation payments for undelivered Model S sedans in an aggregate amount of 
$28.3 million and payments for Tesla Roadsters in an aggregate amount of $2.5 
million. In order to convert the reservation payments into revenue, we will need
to sell vehicles to these customers. All reservation payments for Model S are 
fully refundable until such time that a customer enters into a purchase 
agreement.
