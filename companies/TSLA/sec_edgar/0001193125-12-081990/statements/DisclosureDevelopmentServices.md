Daimler AG

Daimler Smart Fortwo EV Program

In May 2009, we and Daimler formalized a development arrangement related to 
Daimler's Smart fortwo electric vehicle program under which we were performing 
powertrain development activities since 2008. In May 2009, we entered into an 
agreement with Daimler related to the development of a battery pack and charger 
for Daimler's Smart fortwo electric drive. We began development efforts in the 
year ended December 31, 2008 and began receiving payments to compensate us for 
the cost of our development activities prior to entering into the formal 
agreement in May 2009. We received aggregate payments in the amount of $10.2 
million during 2008 for our services; however, we deferred recognition for these
payments received in advance of the execution of the final agreement because a 
number of significant contractual terms were not in place prior to that time. 
Upon entering into the final agreement in May 2009, we had received and deferred
an aggregate of $14.5 million under the agreement. Under the terms of the final 
agreement, Daimler was to pay us an additional $8.7 million subject to 
successful completion and acceptance of certain development milestones.

We recognized the $14.5 million paid in advance of the execution of the final 
agreement as deferred development compensation on a straight-line basis. This 
amount was recognized over the expected life of the agreement, beginning in May 
2009 and continuing through November 2009. Payments received upon the 
achievement of development milestones subsequent to the execution of the final 
agreement in May 2009 were recognized upon achievement and acceptance of the 
respective milestones. All amounts received under this agreement were recognized
as an offset to research and development expenses, as we were performing 
development activities on behalf of Daimler, were being compensated for the cost
of these activities and could not practicably separate the efforts or costs 
related to these activities from our own research and development. During the 
year ended December 31, 2009, we recognized $23.2 million in development 
compensation, as an offset to research and development expenses. As of December 
31, 2009, all development work related to the development agreement had been 
completed, and we had recognized the full $23.2 million under the development 
agreement.

Upon completion of the development activities, we began selling powertrain 
components to Daimler for the Smart fortwo EV program. Powertrain component 
sales are recorded in automotive sales revenue and during the years ended 
December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009, we recognized revenue of $7.2 million, $21.1 
million and $0.4 million, respectively.

Daimler A-Class Program

During the three months ended March 31, 2010, Daimler also engaged us to assist 
with the development and production of a battery pack and charger for a pilot 
fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in Europe during 2011. 
We began providing development services for this program during the three months
ended March 31, 2010 and had received an aggregate of $5.5 million in payments; 
however, as we had not executed a final agreement related to this program as of 
March 31, 2010, we deferred the $5.5 million of payments that had been received 
from Daimler to that point. In May 2010, we executed a final agreement under 
which Daimler would make additional payments to us for the successful completion
of certain development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples. As of 
December 31, 2010, all development work related to the development agreement had
been completed, and we had recognized the full $14.4 million under the 
development agreement.

As of December 31, 2010, all development work related to the A-Class EV 
development program had been completed and as such, no further development 
services revenue were recorded during the year ended December 31, 2011. Costs of
development services incurred prior to the finalization of the A-Class agreement
were recorded as research and development expenses. During the three months 
ended March 31, 2010, we recorded $0.5 million of such costs in research and 
development.

Toyota Motor Corporation

Toyota RAV4 Program

In July 2010, we and Toyota entered into a Phase 0 agreement to initiate 
development of an electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. Under this early 
phase development agreement, prototypes would be made by us by combining the 
Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric powertrain. We began producing and 
delivering prototypes to Toyota during the three months ended September 30, 
2010. Pursuant to the agreement, Toyota would pay us up to $9 million for the 
development services to be provided by us. During the years ended December 31, 
2011 and 2010, we recognized $7.6 million and $1.3 million in development 
services revenue, respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had delivered all 
prototypes.

In October 2010, we entered into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with 
Toyota for the development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery
pack, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated software, which 
will be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Pursuant
to the agreement, Toyota will pay us up to $60.0 million for the successful 
completion of certain at risk development milestones and the delivery of 
prototype samples, including a $5.0 million upfront payment that we received 
upon the execution of the agreement. Through December 31, 2011, we completed 
various milestones and along with the amortization of our upfront payment, we 
recognized $47.4 million and $3.3 million in development services revenue for 
the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. As of December 31, 
2011 and 2010, we had deferred $250,000 and $4.0 million of the upfront payment 
in deferred revenues.

In July 2011, we entered into a supply and services agreement with Toyota for 
the supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a battery pack, 
charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and associated software, which will be
integrated into an electric vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Additionally, we
will provide Toyota with certain services related to the supply of the electric 
powertrain system. We plan to begin delivery of the electric powertrain system 
to Toyota for installation into the Toyota RAV4 EV in 2012 and as such, no 
payments have been received and no revenue has been recognized to date under 
this agreement. Future revenue to be recognized under this agreement will be 
recorded in automotive sales. Our production activities under this program are 
expected to continue through 2014.
