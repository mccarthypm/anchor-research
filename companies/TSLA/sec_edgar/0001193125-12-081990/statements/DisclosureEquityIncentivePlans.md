In July 2003, we adopted the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the 
effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on June 28, 2010 (see 
Note 10), we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan) and all remaining
common shares reserved for future grant or issuance under the 2003 Equity 
Incentive Plan were added to the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The Plan provides 
for the granting of stock options and stock purchase rights to employees, 
directors and consultants of Tesla. Options granted under the Plan may be either
incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock options may be 
granted only to our employees including officers and directors. Nonqualified 
stock options and stock purchase rights may be granted to our employees and 
consultants. Generally, our stock options vest over four years and are 
exercisable over a period not to exceed the contractual term of ten years from 
the date the stock options are granted. Continued vesting typically terminates 
when the employment or consulting relationship ends. As of December 31, 2011, 
there were 9,919,107 shares of common stock reserved for issuance under the 
Plan.

The following table summarizes option activity under the Plan:

In addition to stock options issued from the Plan, there were 33,333 stock 
options as of December 31, 2011 and 66,666 stock options as of December 31, 2010
and 2009, respectively, that we had previously granted to non-employees outside 
of the Plan. These outstanding non-employee options had a weighted average 
exercise price of $1.80 as of each year end.

The aggregate intrinsic value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i. 
e., the difference between our common stock price and the exercise price, 
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have been received 
by the option holders had all option holders exercised their options. The 
aggregate intrinsic value of options outstanding as of December 31, 2011 and 
2010 was $243.9 million and $250.1 million, respectively. The intrinsic value of
options exercisable was $142.8 million and $75.7 million, and the intrinsic 
value of options vested and expected to vest was $220.5 million and $203.0 
million as of December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The total intrinsic 
value of options exercised was $27.8 million and $10.0 million for the years 
ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Fair Value Adoption

We adopted the fair value method on January 1, 2006 in recognizing stock-based 
compensation expense. Under the fair value method, we estimated the fair value 
of each option award and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) on the grant 
date using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the weighted average 
assumptions noted in the following table.

The weighted-average grant-date fair value for option awards granted during the 
years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $17.43, $10.99 and $3.00 per 
share, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date fair value for ESPP granted
during the year ended December 31, 2011 and 2010 was $7.52 and $5.49 per share, 
respectively.

The fair value of the shares of common stock underlying the stock options has 
historically been determined by the Board of Directors as there was no public 
market for our common stock. The Board of Directors has determined fair value of
the common stock at the time of each grant of options by considering a number of
objective and subjective factors including valuation of comparable companies, 
sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties, operating and 
financial performance, the lack of liquidity of capital stock, and trends in the
broader automobile industry. We have not granted stock options with an exercise 
price that is less than the fair value of the underlying common stock as 
determined at the time of grant by our Board of Directors, with input from 
management. The fair market value of the underlying common stock was determined 
by the Board of Directors until the completion of our IPO when our common stock 
was listed on an established stock exchange.

Information regarding our stock option grants during 2009 and the six months 
prior to the completion of our IPO, including the grant date; the number of 
stock options issued with each grant; and the exercise price, which equals the 
grant date fair value of the underlying common stock for each grant of stock 
options, is summarized as follows:

Included in our December 4, 2009 stock option grants were 6,711,972 stock 
options granted to our Chief Executive Officer in two separate grants. In 
recognition of his and our company's achievements and to create incentives for 
future success, our Board of Directors approved an option grant to our Chief 
Executive Officer representing 4% of our fully-diluted share base prior to such 
grant as of December 4, 2009, or 3,355,986 stock options, with 1/4th of the 
shares vesting immediately, and 1/36th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest
each month over three years, assuming continued employment through each vesting 
date. In addition, to create incentives for the attainment of clear performance 
objectives around a key element of our current business plan - the successful 
launch and commercialization of Model S - the Board of Directors approved an 
additional option grant to our Chief Executive Officer totaling an additional 4%
of our fully-diluted shares prior to such grant as of December 4, 2009, or 
3,355,986 stock options, with a vesting schedule based entirely on the 
attainment of performance objectives as follows, assuming Mr. Musk's continued 
employment and service to us through each vesting date:

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
successful completion of Model S Engineering Prototype;  
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
─────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
successful completion of Model S Validation Prototype;  
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
completion of the first Model S Production Vehicle; and  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest upon the 
completion of the 10,000th Model S Production Vehicle.  

If he does not meet one or more of the above milestones prior to the fourth 
anniversary of the date of the grant, he will forfeit his right to the unvested 
portion of the grant.

Due to the significant number of stock options granted to our Chief Executive 
Officer, we valued these December 2009 grants by using the following 
grant-specific Black-Scholes assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.7%, 
expected term of 4.1 years, expected volatility of 70% and dividend yield of 0%.
Stock-based compensation expense related to Mr. Musk's grants was $6.3 million 
and $9.2 million for the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Included in our June 2010 and September 2010 stock option grants were 666,300 
and 20,000, respectively, of stock options granted to various members of our 
senior management with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment of 
the same performance objectives as those outlined for Mr. Musk above. Through 
December 31, 2011, the first two performance milestones were achieved and the 
remaining performance milestones were considered probable of achievement. For 
the years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $4.9 million and $8.9 
million, respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to the 
attainment of performance objectives.

The following table summarizes the consolidated stock-based compensation expense
by line item in the consolidated statements of operations (in thousands):

We realized no income tax benefit from stock option exercises in each of the 
periods presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances. As required,
we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock options, if any, as 
financing cash flows rather than operating cash flows.

As of December 31, 2011, we had $55.2 million of total unrecognized compensation
expense, net of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized over a 
weighted-average period of 2.38 years.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

Concurrent with the effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on 
June 28, 2010 (see Note 10), we established the ESPP. Under the ESPP, employees 
are eligible to purchase common stock through payroll deductions of up to 15% of
their eligible compensation, subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price
of the shares on each purchase date is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair 
market value of our common stock on the first and last trading days of each 
six-month offering period. During the year ended December 31, 2011, 223,458 
shares were issued under the ESPP for $3.9 million. A total of 2,615,749 shares 
of common stock have been reserved for issuance under the ESPP, and there were 
2,392,291 shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of December 31, 2011.
