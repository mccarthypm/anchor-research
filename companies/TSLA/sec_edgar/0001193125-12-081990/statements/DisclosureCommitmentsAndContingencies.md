Operating Leases

Our corporate headquarters and powertrain production operations are based in 
Palo Alto, California where we have leased a facility consisting of 350,000 
square feet. This lease expires in January 2016. We also lease office space 
under non-cancelable operating leases with various expiration dates through 
December 2022. Rent expense for the years ended December 31, 2011, 2010 and 2009
was $8.6 million, $6.3 million and $3.2 million, respectively.

Capital Leases

We have entered into various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases 
over terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are 
collateral for the lease obligations and are included within property, plant and
equipment, net, on the consolidated balance sheets under the categories of 
computer equipment and software and office furniture and equipment.

Future minimum commitments for leases as of December 31, 2011 are as follows (in

Environmental Liabilities

In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile 
production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI (see Note 5). 
NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site 
which affect soil and groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts 
to address these conditions. These conditions are now being addressed by us and 
NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has documented and managed
the environmental issues and we completed a reasonable level of diligence on 
such environmental issues at the time we purchased the facility, we cannot 
determine the exact potential costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination 
with any certainty. Based on management's best estimate, we estimated the fair 
value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The 
fair value of these liabilities was determined based on an expected value 
analysis of the related potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage 
various environmental conditions that were identified as part of NUMMI's 
facility decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As we 
continue with our construction and operating activities, it is reasonably 
possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially.

We have reached an agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we 
will pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any governmentally-required 
remediation activities for contamination that existed prior to the completion of
the facility and land purchase for any known or unknown environmental 
conditions, and NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such 
remediation activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up 
to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are incurred in the 
first four years of our agreement, subject to our reimbursement of such costs on
the fourth anniversary date of the closing.

On the ten-year anniversary of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been 
spent on the remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI's liability to
us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and we are responsible for any
and all environmental conditions at the Fremont site. At that point in time, we 
have agreed to indemnify, defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and
we have released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for NUMMI's 
obligations for representations and warranties under the agreement. As of 
December 31, 2011, we have accrued $5.3 million related to these environmental 
liabilities.
