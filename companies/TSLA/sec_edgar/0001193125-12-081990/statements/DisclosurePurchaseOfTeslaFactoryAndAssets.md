Tesla Factory

In May 2010, we entered into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile 
production facility located in Fremont, California from NUMMI, which is a joint 
venture between Toyota, and Motors Liquidation Company, the owner of selected 
assets of General Motors. In October 2010, we completed the purchase and 
received title to the facility and land. The total cash paid was $42.0 million. 
The purchase totals 210 acres, or approximately 55% of the land at the site, and
includes all of the manufacturing facilities located thereon. In October 2010, 
we and NUMMI amended the facility purchase agreement to include the transfer to 
us of certain operating permits, or emission credits, for additional 
consideration of $6.5 million. We completed the transfer of these permits in 
October 2010. We intend to use the facility and manufacturing assets for the 
production of our Model S vehicle and to build our future vehicles.

NUMMI has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont site 
which affect soil and groundwater, and is currently undertaking efforts to 
address these conditions. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has 
documented and managed the environmental issues, we cannot determine with 
certainty the total potential costs to remediate pre-existing contamination. 
Based on management's best estimate, we estimated the fair value of the 
environmental liabilities that we assumed to be $5.3 million. The fair value of 
these liabilities was determined based on an expected value analysis of the 
related potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various 
environmental conditions that were identified as part of NUMMI's facility 
decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As NUMMI 
continues with its decommissioning activities and we continue with our 
construction and operating activities, it is reasonably possible that our 
estimate of environmental liabilities may change materially. We have reached an 
agreement with NUMMI in terms of how we and NUMMI will take responsibility for 
any costs related to governmentally-required remediation activities for 
contamination that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land 
purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions (see Note 15).

The purchase consideration for the Tesla Factory located in Fremont, California 
consisted of cash paid of $48.5 million and liabilities assumed of $5.3 million 
for an aggregate purchase price of $53.8 million. The aggregate purchase price 
of $53.8 million was allocated to land, building, site improvements and emission
credits based on their relative fair values as the total estimated fair values 
of these assets were greater than the total purchase price. The following table 
summarizes the allocation of the purchase price to the tangible and intangible 
assets purchased as of the date of purchase (in thousands):

  Building and site improvements      13,556  
  Land                                25,736  
  Emission credits                    14,508  
                                      53,800  

Building and site improvements are classified within construction in progress 
and together with land, are recorded in property, plant and equipment, net, on 
the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair value of land was determined 
using the market approach. Although the market approach compares the subject 
asset purchase to similar transactions which would otherwise classify these 
inputs within Level II of the fair value hierarchy, adjustments we made to 
comparable sales both qualitatively and quantitatively caused us to classify 
these inputs within Level III of the fair value hierarchy. The fair value of the
building and site improvements were estimated using the cost approach and 
therefore, the inputs are classified within Level III of the fair value 
hierarchy. Incremental due diligence costs of $0.7 million related to the 
purchase of the land have been capitalized to land.

Emission credits are classified as intangible assets and are recorded in other 
noncurrent assets on the consolidated balance sheet. The estimated fair value of
emission credits was determined using market data related to traded emission 
credits and as such, these inputs are classified within Level I of the fair 
value hierarchy. The utility of the emission credits are related to the 
operation of the Tesla Factory and therefore, will be amortized over the same 
useful life. As the Tesla Factory is not yet ready for its intended use, we have
not yet commenced the depreciation of the Tesla Factory or the amortization of 
the emission credits. We currently estimate that building and building 
improvements, as well as the emission credits, will have an estimated useful 
life of 30 years.

Manufacturing Assets

In August 2010, we entered into a separate purchase agreement with NUMMI for the
purchase of certain manufacturing equipment and spare parts located at the 
Fremont facility. This purchase agreement was subsequently amended to include 
additional manufacturing equipment and spare parts. In October 2010, we 
completed this purchase concurrent with the completion of the facility purchase.
The aggregate purchase price for these assets was $16.7 million reflecting the 
estimated fair value of these assets. As these manufacturing assets and spare 
parts are not yet ready for their intended use, they are classified within 
construction in progress and recorded in property, plant and equipment, net, on 
the consolidated balance sheet. We have not yet commenced the depreciation of 
these assets. We currently estimate that manufacturing and related assets will 
have an estimated useful life of up to 15 years.
