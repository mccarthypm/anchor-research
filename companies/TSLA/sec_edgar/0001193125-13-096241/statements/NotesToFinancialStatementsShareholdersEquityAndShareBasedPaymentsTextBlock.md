| **      Equity Incentive Plans** | 10. Equity Incentive
Plans

In July 2003, we adopted
the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan. Concurrent with the effectiveness
of our registration statement on Form S-1 on June 28, 2010
(see Note 9), we adopted the 2010 Equity Incentive Plan (the Plan)
and all remaining common shares reserved for future grant or
issuance under the 2003 Equity Incentive Plan were added to the
2010 Equity Incentive Plan. The Plan provides for the granting of
stock options and stock purchase rights to our employees, directors
and consultants. Options granted under the Plan may be either
incentive options or nonqualified stock options. Incentive stock
options may be granted only to our employees including officers and
directors. Nonqualified stock options and stock purchase rights may
be granted to our employees and consultants. Generally, our stock
options vest over four years and are exercisable over a period not
to exceed the contractual term of ten years from the date the stock
options are granted. Continued vesting typically terminates when
the employment or consulting relationship ends. As of
December 31, 2012, there were 469,531 shares of common stock
reserved for issuance under the Plan.

The following table
summarizes option activity under the Plan:

In addition to stock
options issued from the Plan, there were zero, 33,333 and 66,666
stock options as of December 31, 2012, 2011and 2010,
respectively, that we had previously granted to non-employees
outside of the Plan. These outstanding non-employee options had a
weighted average exercise price of $1.80 as of each year
end.

The aggregate intrinsic
value represents the total pretax intrinsic value (i. e., the
difference between our common stock price and the exercise price,
multiplied by the number of in-the-money options) that would have
been received by the option holders had all option holders
exercised their options. The aggregate intrinsic value of options
outstanding as of December 31, 2012 and 2011 was $317.7
million and $243.9 million, respectively. The intrinsic value
of options exercisable was $233.3 million and $142.8 million,
and the intrinsic value of options vested and expected to vest was
$280.7 million and $220.5 million as of December 31, 2012
and 2011, respectively. The total intrinsic value of options
exercised was $35.1 million and $27.8 million for the years
ended December 31, 2012 and 2011,
respectively.

Fair Value
Adoption

We utilize the fair value
method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the
fair value method, we estimated the fair value of each option award
and Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the ESPP) on the grant date
generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
weighted average assumptions noted in the following
table.

The weighted-average
grant-date fair value for option awards granted during the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $16.37, $17.43 and
$10.99 per share, respectively. The weighted-average grant-date
fair value for ESPP granted during the years ended
December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $8.99, $7.52 and $5.49
per share, respectively.

The fair value of the
shares of common stock underlying stock options granted to prior to
our IPO in July 2010 was determined by the Board of Directors as
there was no public market for our common stock. The Board of
Directors determined fair value of the common stock at the time of
each grant of options by considering a number of objective and
subjective factors including valuation of comparable companies,
sales of convertible preferred stock to unrelated third parties,
operating and financial performance, the lack of liquidity of
capital stock, and trends in the broader automobile industry. We
have not granted stock options with an exercise price that is less
than the fair value of the underlying common stock as determined at
the time of grant by our Board of Directors, with input from
management.

Information regarding our
stock option grants during the six months prior to the completion
of our IPO, including the grant date; the number of stock options
issued with each grant; and the exercise price, which equals the
grant date fair value of the underlying common stock for each grant
of stock options, is summarized as follows:

Performance-Based Stock
Options

In December 2009, our Board
of Directors approved an option grant to our CEO representing 4% of
our fully-diluted share base prior to such grant as of the grant
date, or 3,355,986 stock options, with 1/4th of the shares vesting
immediately, and 1/36th of the remaining shares scheduled to vest
each month over three years, assuming continued employment through
each vesting date in recognition of his and our company’s
achievements and to create incentives for future success. In
addition, to create incentives for the attainment of clear
performance objectives around a key element of our business
plan - the successful launch and commercialization of Model
S - the Board of Directors approved an additional option grant
to our CEO totaling an additional 4% of our fully-diluted shares
prior to such grant as of the grant date, or 3,355,986 stock
options, with a vesting schedule based entirely on the attainment
of performance objectives as follows, assuming our CEO’s
continued employment and service to us through each vesting
date:

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest  
  upon the successful completion of Model S Engineering            
  Prototype;                                                       
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest  
  upon the successful completion of Model S Validation             
  Prototype;                                                       
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest  

  1/4th of the shares subject to the option are scheduled to vest  

If he does not meet one or
more of the above milestones prior to the fourth anniversary of the
date of the grant, he will forfeit his right to the unvested
portion of the grant. Through December 31, 2012, the first
three performance milestones were achieved and the remaining
performance milestone was considered probable of
achievement.

Due to the significant
number of stock options granted to our CEO, we valued these
December 2009 grants by using the following grant-specific
Black-Scholes assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.7%,
expected term of 4.1 years, expected volatility of 70% and dividend
yield of 0%. Stock-based compensation expense related to this grant
to our CEO was $4.2 million, $6.3 million and $9.2 million for
the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

Our Board of Directors also
approved option grants in June and September 2010 to purchase our
common stock of 666,300 and 20,000, respectively, to various
members of our senior management with a vesting schedule based
entirely on the attainment of the same performance objectives as
those outlined for our CEO above. Through December 31, 2012,
the first three performance milestones were achieved and the
remaining performance milestone was considered probable of
achievement. For the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and
2010, we recognized $1.4 million, $4.9 million and $8.9 million,
respectively, of stock-based compensation expense related to the
attainment of performance objectives. In August 2012, to create
incentives for continued long term success beyond the Model S
program and to closely align executive pay with increases in
stockholder value, our Board of Directors granted 5,274,901 stock
options to our CEO (2012 CEO Grant). The 2012 CEO Grant consists of
ten vesting tranches with a vesting schedule based entirely on the
attainment of both performance conditions and market conditions,
assuming continued employment and service to us through each
vesting date.

Each of the following ten
vesting tranches requires a combination of one of the performance
achievements outlined below and an incremental increase in our
market capitalization of $4.0 billion, as compared to the initial
market capitalization of $3.2 billion.

The term of the 2012 CEO
Grant will be ten years, so that if any vesting tranches remain
unvested after expiration of the 2012 CEO Grant, they will be
forfeited. In addition, our CEO will forfeit any unvested options
if he is terminated as CEO of the Company, whether for cause or
otherwise.

We measured the fair value
of the 2012 CEO Grant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach with
the following assumptions: risk-free interest rate of 1.65%,
expected term of ten years, expected volatility of 55% and dividend
yield of 0%.

Stock-based compensation
expense associated with the 2012 CEO Grant is recognized for each
performance condition over the vesting period beginning at the
point in time that the relevant performance condition is considered
probable of being met, regardless as to whether the related market
condition is ever met (though meeting the market condition would
also be required in order for the related options to ultimately
vest).

As of December 31,
2012, a performance milestone, coupled with a market condition, was
considered probable of achievement. Stock-based compensation
expense related to the 2012 CEO Grant was $1.3 million for the year
ended December 31, 2012.

We realized no income tax
benefit from stock option exercises in each of the periods
presented due to recurring losses and valuation allowances. As
required, we present excess tax benefits from the exercise of stock
options, if any, as financing cash flows rather than operating cash
flows.

As of December 31,
2012, we had $109.5 million of total unrecognized compensation
expense, net, of estimated forfeitures, that will be recognized
over a weighted-average period of 5.35 years.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

Concurrent with the
effectiveness of our registration statement on Form S-1 on
June 28, 2010 (see Note 9), we established the ESPP. Under the
ESPP, employees are eligible to purchase common stock through
payroll deductions of up to 15% of their eligible compensation,
subject to any plan limitations. The purchase price of the shares
on each purchase date is equal to 85% of the lower of the fair
market value of our common stock on the first and last trading days
of each six-month offering period. During the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011, 373,526 shares and 223,458 shares
were issued under the ESPP for $8.4 million and $3.9 million,
respectively. A total of 2,615,749 shares of common stock have been
reserved for issuance under the ESPP, and there were 2,018,765
shares available for issuance under the ESPP as of
December 31, 2012.
