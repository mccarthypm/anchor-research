Management believes that
based on the available information, it is more likely than not that
the deferred tax assets will not be realized, such that a full
valuation allowance is required against all U. S. deferred tax
assets.

As of December 31,
2012, we had approximately $947.6 million of federal and
$578.3 million of California operating loss carry-forwards
available to offset future taxable income, $32.3 million of which
is associated with windfall tax benefits that will be recorded as
additional paid-in capital when realized. These carryforwards will
expire in varying amounts beginning in 2024 for federal and 2019
for state if unused. Additionally, we have research and development
tax credits of approximately $10.9 million and
$16.0 million for federal and state income tax purposes,
respectively. If not utilized, the federal carry-forwards will
expire in various amounts beginning in 2019. However, the state
credits can be carried forward indefinitely.

We have indefinitely
reinvested $2.3 million of undistributed earnings of our foreign
operations outside of our U. S. tax jurisdiction as of
December 31, 2012. No deferred tax liability has been
recognized for the remittance of such earnings to the United States
since it is our intention to utilize these earnings to fund future
foreign expansions including but not limited to, hiring of
additional personnel, capital purchases, expansion into larger
facilities, and potential new dealerships, and determination of the
potential deferred tax liability is not
practical.

Federal and state laws can
impose substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating
loss and tax credit carry-forwards in the event of an
“ownership change,” as defined in Section 382 of
the Internal Revenue Code. Prior to our IPO, we performed a study
and had determined that no significant limitation would be placed
on the utilization of our net operating loss and tax credit
carry-forwards as a result of prior ownership changes. We do not
believe that our public offerings and private placements
constituted an ownership change resulting in limitations on our
ability to use our net operating loss and tax credit
carry-forwards; however, we have not yet performed a study
subsequent to our IPO to determine whether such limitations
exist.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

The aggregate changes in
the balance of our gross unrecognized tax benefits during the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 were as follows (in
thousands):

  Increases in balances                                      797

  December 31,                                            16,393  
  Increases in balances                                    1,037  
  December 31,                                            17,430  
  Increases in balances                                      640  
  December 31,                                            18,070  

Accrued interest and
penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified as
income tax expense and was immaterial. As of December 31,
2012, unrecognized tax benefits of $18.1 million, if
recognized, would not affect our effective tax rate as the tax
benefits would increase a deferred tax asset which is currently
fully offset with a full valuation allowance. We do not anticipate
that the amount of existing unrecognized tax benefits will
significantly increase or decrease within the next 12 months. We
file income tax returns in the United States, California, various
states and foreign jurisdictions. Tax years 2009 to 2011 remain
subject to examination for federal purposes, and tax years 2008 to
2011 remain subject to examination for California purposes. All net
operating losses and tax credits generated to date are subject to
adjustment for U. S. federal and California purposes. Tax years 2007
to 2011 remain open for examination in other U. S. state and foreign
jurisdictions.
