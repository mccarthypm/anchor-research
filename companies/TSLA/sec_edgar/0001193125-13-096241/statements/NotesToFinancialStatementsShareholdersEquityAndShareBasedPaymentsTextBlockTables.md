| **      Schedule of Fair Value of Option Award and Employee Stock Purchase Plan on Grant Date** | We utilize the fair value
method in recognizing stock-based compensation expense. Under the
fair value method, we estimated the fair value of each option award

generally using the Black-Scholes option pricing model and the
weighted average assumptions noted in the following
table.
