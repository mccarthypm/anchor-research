DOE Loan
Facility

In February 2013, we made a
pre-funding payment of $14.6 million for all principal and interest
that will come due on June 15, 2013 into a dedicated debt
service reserve account in accordance with the pre-funding
requirement under the DOE Loan Facility. We entered
into an amendment with the DOE effective  March 1, 2013. We
agreed among other things to: (i) modify certain future financial
covenants; (ii) accelerate the maturity date of the DOE Loan
Facility to December 15, 2017; (iii) create an obligation to repay
approximately 1.0% of the outstanding principal under the DOE Loan
Facility on or before June 15, 2013; and (iv) create additional
contingent obligations based on excess cash flow that may result in
accelerated repayment of the DOE Loan Facility starting in 2015.
The original amortization schedule for the DOE Loan Facility is not
affected by this recent amendment, and so the debt service payments
remain the same until the new maturity date when all outstanding
loans under the DOE Loan Facility are to be repaid. Conforming
administrative changes to documents related to this amendment are
in process and expected to be completed in March
2013.
