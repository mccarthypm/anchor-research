| **      Fair Value of Financial Instruments** | 4. Fair Value of
Financial Instruments

The carrying
values of our financial instruments including cash equivalents,
marketable securities, accounts receivable and accounts payable
approximate their fair value due to their short-term nature. As a
basis for determining the fair value of certain of our assets and
liabilities, we established a three-tier fair value hierarchy which
prioritizes the inputs used in measuring fair value as follows:
(Level I) observable inputs such as quoted prices in active
markets; (Level II) inputs other than the quoted prices in active
markets that are observable either directly or indirectly; and
(Level III) unobservable inputs in which there is little or no
market data which requires us to develop our own assumptions. This
hierarchy requires us to use observable market data, when
available, and to minimize the use of unobservable inputs when
determining fair value. Our financial assets that are measured at
fair value on a recurring basis consist of cash equivalents and
marketable securities. Our liabilities that are measured at fair
value on a recurring basis consist of our common stock warrant
liability.

All of our cash
equivalents and current restricted cash, which are comprised
primarily of money market funds, are classified within Level I of
the fair value hierarchy because they are valued using quoted
market prices or market prices for similar securities. Our
short-term marketable securities are classified within Level II of
the fair value hierarchy and the market approach was used to
determine fair value of these investments. Our common stock warrant
liability (see Note 8) is classified within Level III of the fair
value hierarchy.

As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, the fair value hierarchy for our
financial assets and financial liabilities that are carried at fair
value was as follows (in thousands):

All of our
marketable securities with gross unrealized losses had been in a
continuous unrealized loss position for less than twelve months as
of December 31, 2011. We determined that the gross unrealized
losses on our marketable securities as of December 31, 2011
were temporary in nature.

The changes in
the fair value of our common stock warrant liability were as
follows (in thousands):

The estimated
fair value of our long-term debt based on a market approach was
approximately $366.9 million (par value of $452.3 million) and
$220.3 million (par value of $276.3 million) as of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and represent Level
II valuations. When determining the estimated fair value of our
long-term debt, we used a commonly accepted valuation methodology
and market-based risk measurements that are indirectly observable,
such as credit risk.

We operate in
various foreign countries, which exposes us to foreign currency
exchange risk between the U. S. dollar and various foreign
currencies, the most significant of which have been the Japanese
yen, euro and British pound. In order to manage this risk, we enter
into selected foreign currency forward contracts. These contracts
are not designated as hedges, and as a result, changes in their
fair value are recorded in other expense, net, on our consolidated
statements of operations. During the years ended December 31,
2012, 2011 and 2010, net gains and losses related to these
instruments were not significant. We had notional amounts on
foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding of $8.8 million as
of December 31, 2011. There were no foreign currency forward
contracts outstanding as of December 31, 2012.
