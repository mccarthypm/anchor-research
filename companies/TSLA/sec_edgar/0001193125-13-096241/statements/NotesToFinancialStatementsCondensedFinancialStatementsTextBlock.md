| **      Restatement of Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial Statements** | 17. Restatement of
Unaudited Condensed Consolidated Financial
Statements

On March 6,
2013, we concluded that the condensed consolidated statements of
cash flows for the year-to-date periods ended March 31, 2012, June
30, 2012 and September 30, 2012, including comparatively presented
periods, that we previously included in our Quarterly Reports on
Forms 10-Q filed in 2012 should be restated as a result of
erroneous inclusion in cash outflows from investing activities
amounts related to purchases of property and equipment not yet paid
for at each balance sheet date.

These
restatements result in decreases in cash flows used in investing
activities and corresponding increases in cash flows used in
operating activities. These restatements had no impact on our
previously reported total cash and cash equivalents, condensed
consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of
operations.

As detailed in
the tables below, these restatements impact the following condensed
consolidated cash flow line items:
