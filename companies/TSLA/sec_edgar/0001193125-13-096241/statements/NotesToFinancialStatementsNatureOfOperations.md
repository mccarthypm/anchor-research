|       Overview of the Company | 1. Overview of the
Company

Tesla Motors,
Inc. (Tesla, we, us or our) was incorporated in the state of
Delaware on July 1, 2003. We design, develop, manufacture and
sell high-performance fully electric vehicles and advanced electric
vehicle powertrain components. We have wholly-owned subsidiaries in
North America, Europe and Asia.  The primary purpose of these
subsidiaries is to market and/or service our vehicles.

Since
inception, we have incurred significant losses and have used
approximately $709.2 million of cash in operations through
December 31, 2012. As of December 31, 2012, we had
$201.9 million in cash and cash equivalents. We expect that
our current sources of liquidity, including cash, cash equivalents,
cash held in our dedicated Department of Energy (DOE) account,
together with our current projections of cash flow from operating
activities, will provide us adequate liquidity, based on our
current plans. These capital sources will enable us to fund our
ongoing operations, continue research and development projects and
establish sales and service centers.

Correction of Prior Year
Amounts

We have revised
our consolidated statement of cash flows for the year ended
December 31, 2011 to correct an immaterial error. Amounts related
to purchases of property and equipment during 2011 that were not
paid at December 31, 2011 were erroneously included as cash
outflows from investing activities in our previously issued
financial statements. This revision resulted in a $13.7 million
decrease in purchases of property and equipment included in cash
flows used in investing activities and a corresponding increase in
the change in accounts payable resulting in an increase in cash
flows used in operating activities. We have also revised our
supplemental disclosure of noncash acquisition of property and
equipment by an increase of $12.9 million for 2011.

Additionally,
we have restated the unaudited statements of cash flows for interim
periods during the years ended December 31, 2012 and 2011 for
similar errors in our cash flows used in investing activities and
cash flows used in operating activities (see Note 17).

There was no
impact on previously reported total cash and cash equivalents,
consolidated balance sheets or consolidated statements of
operations.

Unadjusted Error in
2009

In June 2010,
we identified an error related to the understatement in stock-based
compensation expense subsequent to the issuance of the consolidated
financial statements for the year ended December 31,
2009.

In the fourth
quarter of 2009, we granted certain stock options for which a
portion of the grant was immediately vested. We erroneously
accounted for the expense on a straight-line basis over the term of
the award, while expense recognition should always be at least
commensurate with the number of awards vesting during the period.
As a result, selling, general and administrative expenses and net
loss for the year ended December 31, 2009 were understated by
$2.7 million. The error did not have an effect on the valuation of
the stock options. As stock-based compensation expense is a
non-cash item, there was no impact on net cash used in operating
activities for the year ended December 31, 2009.

To correct this
error, we recorded additional stock-based compensation of
$2.4 million in the three months ended June 30, 2010. We
considered the impact of the error on reported operating expenses
and trends in operating results and determined that the impact of
the error was not material to previously reported financial
information as well as those related to the year ended
December 31, 2010.
