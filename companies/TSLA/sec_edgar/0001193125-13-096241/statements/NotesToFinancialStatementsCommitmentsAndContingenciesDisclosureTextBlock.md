Operating
Leases

Our corporate headquarters
and powertrain production operations are based in Palo Alto,
California where we have leased a facility consisting of 350,000
square feet. This lease expires in January 2020. We also lease
office space under non-cancelable operating leases with various
expiration dates through December 2022. Rent expense for the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010 was $12.1 million,
$8.6 million and $6.3 million, respectively.

Capital
Leases

We have entered into
various agreements to lease equipment under capital leases over
terms between 36 and 60 months. The equipment under the leases are
collateral for the lease obligations and are included within
property, plant and equipment, net, on the consolidated balance
sheets under the categories of computer equipment and software and
office furniture and equipment.

Environmental
Liabilities

In May 2010, we entered
into an agreement to purchase an existing automobile production
facility located in Fremont, California from New United Motor
Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI has previously identified
environmental conditions at the Fremont site which affect soil and
groundwater, and until recently, were undertaking efforts to
address these conditions. These conditions are now being addressed
by us and NUMMI. Although we have been advised by NUMMI that it has
documented and managed the environmental issues and we completed a
reasonable level of diligence on such environmental issues at the
time we purchased the facility, we cannot determine the potential
costs to remediate any pre-existing contamination with any
certainty. Based on management’s best estimate, we estimated
the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we assumed to
be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities was determined
based on an expected value analysis of the related potential costs
to investigate, remediate and manage various environmental
conditions that were identified as part of NUMMI’s facility
decommissioning activities as well as our own diligence efforts. As
we continue with our construction and operating activities, it is
reasonably possible that our estimate of environmental liabilities
may change materially.

We have reached an
agreement with NUMMI under which, over a ten year period, we will
pay the first $15.0 million of any costs of any
governmentally-required remediation activities for contamination
that existed prior to the completion of the facility and land
purchase for any known or unknown environmental conditions, and
NUMMI has agreed to pay the next $15.0 million for such remediation
activities. Our agreement provides, in part, that NUMMI will pay up
to the first $15.0 million on our behalf if such expenses are
incurred in the first four years of our agreement, subject to our
reimbursement of such costs on the fourth anniversary date of the
closing.

On the ten-year anniversary
of the closing or whenever $30.0 million has been spent on the
remediation activities, whichever comes first, NUMMI’s
liability to us with respect to remediation activities ceases, and
we are responsible for any and all environmental conditions at the
Fremont site. At that point in time, we have agreed to indemnify,
defend, and hold harmless NUMMI from all liability and we have
released NUMMI for any known or unknown claims except for
NUMMI’s obligations for representations and warranties under
the agreement. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we have
accrued $5.3 million related to these environmental liabilities,
respectively.

From time to time, we are
subject to various legal proceedings that arise from the normal
course of business activities. In addition, from time to time,
third parties may assert intellectual property infringement claims
against us in the form of letters and other forms of communication.
If an unfavorable ruling were to occur, there exists the
possibility of a material adverse impact on our results of
operations, prospects, cash flows, financial position and
brand.
