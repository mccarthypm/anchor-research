Daimler A-Class
Program

During the three months
ended March 31, 2010, Daimler engaged us to assist with the
development and production of a battery pack and charger for a
pilot fleet of its A-Class electric vehicles to be introduced in
Europe during 2011. As of December 31, 2010, all development
work related to the development agreement had been completed, and
we had recognized the full $14.4 million under the development
agreement.

Daimler Mercedes-Benz
EV Program

During the fourth quarter
of 2011, Daimler engaged us to assist with the development of a
full electric powertrain for a Daimler Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV
vehicle. In 2012, we received two purchase orders from Daimler to
begin development work and also entered into a separate development
agreement. Pursuant to the development agreement, Daimler will pay
us up to $33.2 million for the successful completion of certain at
risk development milestones and the delivery of prototype samples.
During the year ended December 31, 2012, we completed various
milestones and delivered prototype samples. During the year ended
December 31, 2012, we recognized $15.9 million in development
services revenue related to the Mercedes-Benz B-Class EV
program.

Toyota Motor
Corporation

Toyota RAV4
Program

In July 2010, we and Toyota
entered into a Phase 0 agreement to initiate development of an
electric powertrain for the Toyota RAV4. Under this early phase
development agreement, prototypes were made by us by combining the
Toyota RAV4 model with a Tesla electric powertrain. During the
years ended December 31, 2011 and 2010, we recognized $7.6
million and $1.3 million in development services revenue,
respectively. As of December 31, 2011, we had delivered all
prototypes.

In October 2010, we entered
into a Phase 1 contract services agreement with Toyota for the
development of a validated powertrain system, including a battery
pack, power electronics module, motor, gearbox and associated
software to be integrated into an electric vehicle version of the
Toyota RAV4. Toyota paid $60.1 million for the successful
completion of certain at risk development milestones and the
delivery of prototype samples, including a $5.0 million upfront
payment that we received upon the execution of the agreement.
During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we
completed various milestones and along with the amortization of our
upfront payment and the delivery of certain prototype samples, we
recognized $10.7 million, $47.4 million and $3.3 million in
development services revenue, respectively. As of March 31,
2012, all development milestones under the Phase 1 agreement have
been completed.

In July 2011, we
entered into a supply and services agreement with Toyota for the
supply of a validated electric powertrain system, including a
battery pack, charging system, inverter, motor, gearbox and
associated software, which will be integrated into an electric
vehicle version of the Toyota RAV4. Additionally, we will provide
Toyota with certain services related to the supply of the electric
powertrain system. During the three months ended March 31,
2012, we began delivering electric powertrain systems to Toyota.
During the year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized revenue
of $29.1 million in automotive sales related to these sales. Our
production activities under this program are expected to continue
through 2014.
