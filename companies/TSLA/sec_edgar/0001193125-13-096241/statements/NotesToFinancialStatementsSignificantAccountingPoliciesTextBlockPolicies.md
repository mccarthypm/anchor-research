|       Use of Estimates | Use of
Estimates

The preparation
of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles
generally accepted in the United States of America requires
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of
contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements, and
reported amounts of expenses during the reporting period, including
revenue recognition, inventory valuation, warranties, fair value of
financial instruments and stock-based compensation. Actual results
could differ from those estimates.

| **      Revenue Recognition** | Revenue
Recognition

We recognize
revenues from sales of Model S and the Tesla Roadster, including
vehicle options and accessories, vehicle service and sales of
regulatory credits, such as zero emission vehicle (ZEV) and
greenhouse gas emission (GHG) credits, as well as sales of electric
vehicle powertrain components and systems, such as battery packs
and drive units and sales of services related to the development of
these systems. We recognize revenue when: (i) persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists; (ii) delivery has occurred
and there are no uncertainties regarding customer acceptance;
(iii) fees are fixed or determinable; and (iv) collection
is reasonably assured.

For multiple
deliverable revenue arrangements, we allocate revenue to each
element based on a selling price hierarchy. The selling price for a
deliverable is based on its vendor specific objective evidence
(VSOE) if available, third party evidence (TPE) if VSOE is not
available, or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor TPE is
available. To date, we have been able to establish the fair value
for each of the deliverables within multiple element arrangements
because we sell each of the vehicles, vehicles accessories and
options separately, outside of any multiple element
arrangements.

Automotive Sales

Automotive
sales consisted of the following for the periods presented (in
thousands):

Automotive
sales consist primarily of revenue earned from the sales of the
Model S, Tesla Roadster, vehicle service, and vehicle options,
accessories and destination charges as well as sales of regulatory
credits. Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from the
sales of electric vehicle powertrain components and systems, such
as battery packs and drive units, to other automotive
manufacturers. Sales or other amounts collected in advance of
meeting all of the revenue recognition criteria are not recognized
in the consolidated statements of operations and are instead
recorded as deferred revenue on the consolidated balance
sheets.

In regards to
the sale of Model S and the Tesla Roadsters, revenue is generally
recognized when all risks and rewards of ownership are transferred
to our customers. In a limited number of circumstances, we may
deliver a vehicle to a customer without all of the options ordered
by the customer if the options do not limit the functionality of
the vehicle. In such cases, we will continue to defer the related
revenue based on the undelivered item’s fair value, as
evidenced by the contractual price of the option in stand-alone
transactions. Automotive sales also consist of revenue earned from
the sales of vehicle options, accessories and destination charges.
While these sales may take place separately from a vehicle sale,
they are often part of a single vehicle sales agreement resulting
in multiple element arrangements. To determine the appropriate
accounting for recognition of our revenue, we consider whether the
deliverables specified in the multiple element arrangement should
be treated as separate units of accounting, and, if so, how the
price should be allocated among the elements, when to recognize
revenue for each element, and the period over which revenue should
be recognized. We also evaluate whether a delivered item has value
on a stand-alone basis prior to delivery of the remaining items by
determining whether we have made separate sales of such items or
whether the undelivered items are essential to the functionality of
the delivered items. Further, we assess whether we know the fair
value of the undelivered items, determined by reference to
stand-alone sales of such items. To date, we have been able to
establish the fair value for each of the deliverables within these
multiple element arrangements because we sell each of the vehicles,
vehicle accessories and options separately, outside of any multiple
element arrangements. As each of these items has stand-alone value
to the customer, revenue from sales of vehicle accessories and
options are recognized when those specific items are delivered to
the customer.

In February
2010, we began offering a leasing program to qualified customers in
the United States for the Tesla Roadster. Through our wholly owned
subsidiary, qualifying customers are permitted to lease the Tesla
Roadster for 36 months, after which time they have the option of
either returning the vehicle to us or purchasing it for a
pre-determined residual value. We account for these leasing
transactions as operating leases and accordingly, we recognize
leasing revenues on a straight-line basis over the term of the
individual leases and record cost of sales equal to the
depreciation of the leased vehicles. As of December 31, 2012
and 2011, we had deferred revenues of $0.7 million and $0.8
million, respectively, of down payments which will be recognized
over the term of the individual leases. Lease revenues are recorded
in automotive sales and for the years ended December 31, 2012,
2011 and 2010, we recognized $3.6 million, $3.0 million and $0.8
million, respectively.

Regulatory Credits Sales

California and
certain other states have laws in place requiring vehicle
manufacturers to ensure that a portion of the vehicles delivered
for sale in that state during each model year are zero emission
vehicles. These laws and regulations provide that a manufacturer of
zero emission vehicles may earn regulatory credits, and may sell
excess credits to other manufacturers who apply such credits to
comply with these regulatory requirements. Similar regulations
exist at the federal level which require compliance related to
greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions and also allow for the sale of
excess credits by one manufacturer to other manufacturers. As a
manufacturer solely of zero emission vehicles, we have earned
emission credits, such as ZEV and GHG credits on vehicles, and we
expect to continue to earn these credits in the future. Since all
of our commercial vehicles are electric, we do not receive any
compliance benefit from the generation of these credits, and
accordingly look to sell them to other vehicle manufacturers. In
order to facilitate the sale of these credits, we enter into
contractual agreements with third parties requiring them to
purchase our regulatory credits at pre-determined prices. We
recognize revenue on the sale of these credits at the time legal
title to the credits are transferred to the purchasing party by the
governmental agency issuing the credits. Revenue from the sale of
regulatory credits totaled $40.5 million, $2.7 million and
$2.8 million for the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011
and 2010, respectively.

Extended
Service and Battery Replacement Plans

We provide Tesla Roadster
customers with the opportunity to purchase an
extended warranty plan for the period after the end of our
initial New Vehicle Limited Warranty to cover additional services
for an additional three years or 36,000 miles. We refer to this
program as our Extended Service plan. Amounts collected on these
sales are initially recorded in deferred revenues on the
consolidated balance sheets and recognized in automotive sales over
the extended warranty period. As of December 31, 2012 and
2011, we had deferred $1.5 million, respectively. During the
year ended December 31, 2012, we recognized revenue of $0.1
million related to this program.

Additionally, we have
previously provided customers of our Tesla Roadsters with a
one-time option to replace the battery packs in their vehicles at
any time after the expiration of the New Vehicle Limited Warranty
but before the tenth anniversary of the purchase date of their
vehicles. We refer to this program as our Battery Replacement
program. Amounts collected on these sales are initially recorded in
deferred revenues on the consolidated balance sheets and recognized
in automotive sales as we fulfill our obligation to replace the
battery packs. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, we had
deferred $1.2 million, respectively, related to the Battery
Replacement program and have not yet recognized any related
revenues.

Development Services
Revenue

Revenue from
development services arrangements consist of revenue earned from
the development of electric vehicle powertrain components and
systems for other automobile manufacturers, including the design
and development of battery packs, drive units and sample vehicles
to meet a customer’s specifications. Revenue is recognized as
the performance requirements of each development arrangement are
met and collection is reasonably assured. Where development
arrangements include substantive at-risk milestones, revenue is
recognized based upon the achievement of the contractually-defined
milestones. Amounts collected in advance of meeting all of the
revenue recognition criteria are not recognized in the consolidated
statement of operations and are instead recorded as deferred
revenue on the consolidated balance sheets. Costs of development
services are expensed as incurred. When development services
arrangements have multiple elements, we evaluate the separability
of the various deliverables to ensure appropriate revenue
recognition. Costs of development services incurred in periods
prior to the finalization of an agreement are recorded as research
and development expenses; once an agreement is finalized, these
costs are recorded in cost of revenues.
 |
| **      Freestanding Stock Warrants** | Freestanding Stock
Warrants

We had
freestanding warrants to purchase shares of our convertible
preferred stock prior to our IPO in July 2010. The warrants were
subject to re-measurement to fair value at each balance sheet date
and any change in fair value was recognized in other expense, net,
on the consolidated statement of operations. For our Series  C
and other Series  E convertible preferred stock warrants,
excluding the DOE warrants, we adjusted the liability for changes
in fair value through the completion of our IPO. At that time, the
convertible preferred stock warrants were net exercised and the
related liability was reclassified to additional paid-in capital.
For the Series  E convertible preferred stock warrants issued
to the DOE (see Note 8), upon the completion of our IPO, the DOE
warrants converted into warrants to purchase our common stock. The
related liability will continue to be adjusted for changes in fair
value until the earlier of vesting or expiration of the warrants.
If the warrants are exercised, the warrant liability will be
reclassified to common stock and additional paid-in
capital.
 |
| **      Cash and Cash Equivalents** | Cash and Cash
Equivalents

All highly
liquid investments with an original or remaining maturity of three
months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash
equivalents. We currently deposit excess cash primarily in money
market funds.
 |
|       Marketable Securities | Marketable
Securities

Marketable
securities are comprised of commercial paper and corporate debt and
are all designated as available-for-sale and reported at estimated
fair value, with unrealized gains and losses recorded in
accumulated other comprehensive loss which is included within
stockholders’ equity. Realized gains and losses on the sale
of available-for-sale marketable securities are recorded in other
expense, net. The cost of available-for-sale marketable securities
sold is based on the specific identification method. Interest,
dividends, amortization and accretion of purchase premiums and
discounts on our marketable securities are included in other
expense, net. Available-for-sale marketable securities with
maturities greater than three months at the date of purchase and
remaining maturities of one year or less are classified as
short-term marketable securities. Where temporary declines in fair
value exist, we have the ability and the intent to hold these
securities for a period of time sufficient to allow for any
anticipated recovery in fair value.

We regularly
review all of our marketable securities for other-than-temporary
declines in fair value. The review includes but is not limited to
(i) the consideration of the cause of the impairment,
(ii) the creditworthiness of the security issuers,
(iii) the length of time a security is in an unrealized loss
position, and (iv) our ability to hold the security for a
period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in
fair value.
 |
|       Restricted Cash and Deposits | Restricted Cash and
Deposits

We maintain
certain cash amounts restricted as to withdrawal or use. We
maintained total restricted cash of $24.3 million and $31.5 million
as of December 31, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Current
restricted cash primarily represents cash held in separate
dedicated accounts required under our DOE loan facility (see Note
8) and is used as a mechanism to defer advances under the DOE loan
facility as well as to pre-fund planned future loan repayments.
Noncurrent restricted cash is comprised primarily of security
deposits held by vendors as part of the vendors’ standard
credit policies, security deposits related to lease agreements and
equipment financing, and certain refundable reservation payments
segregated in accordance with state consumer protection
regulations.
 |
| **      Accounts Receivable and Allowance for Doubtful Accounts** | Accounts Receivable and
Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

Accounts
receivable primarily include amounts related to sales of powertrain
systems and regulatory credits to other vehicle manufacturers. In
circumstances where we are aware of a specific customer’s
inability to meet its financial obligations to us, we provide an
allowance against amounts receivable to reduce the net recognized
receivable to the amount we reasonably believe will be collected.
We typically do not carry accounts receivable related to our
vehicle and related sales as customer payments are due prior to
vehicle delivery.
 |
| **      Concentration of Risk** | Concentration of
Risk

Credit
Risk

Financial
instruments that potentially subject us to a concentration of
credit risk consist of cash, cash equivalents, marketable
securities, restricted cash and accounts receivable. Our cash
equivalents are primarily invested in money market funds with high
credit quality financial institutions in the United States. At
times, these deposits and securities may be in excess of insured
limits. We invest cash not required for use in operations in high
credit quality securities based on our investment policy. Our
investment policy provides guidelines and limits regarding credit
quality, investment concentration, investment type, and maturity
that we believe will provide liquidity while reducing risk of loss
of capital. Investments are of a short-term nature and include
investments in corporate debt securities.

As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, our accounts receivable were
derived primarily from the development and sales of powertrain
systems as well as sales of regulatory credits to other automobile
manufacturers.

The following
summarizes the accounts receivable in excess of 10% of our total
accounts receivable:

                  December 31,              December 31,          
                  2012                      2011                  
  Customer A                        56                        —   
 ──────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Customer B                        15                        52  
  Customer C                        —                         38  

Supply
Risk

Although there
may be multiple suppliers available, many of the components used in
our vehicles are purchased by us from a single source. If these
single source suppliers fail to satisfy our requirements on a
timely basis at competitive prices, we could suffer manufacturing
delays, a possible loss of revenues, or incur higher cost of sales,
any of which could adversely affect our operating
results.
 |
| **      Inventories and Inventory Valuation** | Inventories and
Inventory Valuation

Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost is computed using
standard cost, which approximates actual cost on a first-in,
first-out basis. We record inventory write-downs based on reviews
for excess and obsolescence determined primarily by future demand
forecasts. We also adjust the carrying value of our inventories
when we believe that the net realizable value is less than the
carrying value. These write-downs are measured as the difference
between the cost of the inventory, including estimated costs to
complete, and estimated selling prices. Once inventory is written
down, a new, lower-cost basis for that inventory is established,
and subsequent changes in facts and circumstances do not result in
the restoration or increase in that newly established cost
basis.
 |
| **      Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and
Equipment

Property, plant
and equipment are recognized at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is generally computed using the straight-line method
over the estimated useful lives of the related assets as
follows:

  Computer equipment and           3 years        
  Office furniture, machinery      3 to 12 years  
  Building and building            30 years       

Depreciation
for tooling is computed using the units-of-production method
whereby capitalized costs are amortized over the total estimated
productive life of the related assets, which is generally up
to 125,000 vehicles.

Leasehold
improvements are amortized on a straight-line basis over the
shorter of their estimated useful lives or the term of the related
lease. Upon retirement or sale, the cost and related accumulated
depreciation are removed from the balance sheet and the resulting
gain or loss is reflected in operations. Maintenance and repair
expenditures are expensed as incurred, while major improvements
that increase functionality of the asset are capitalized and
depreciated ratably to expense over the identified useful life.
Land is not depreciated.

Interest
expense on outstanding debt is capitalized during the period of
significant capital asset construction. Capitalized interest on
construction in progress is included in property, plant and
equipment, and is amortized over the life of the related
assets.
 |
| **      Operating Lease Vehicles** | Operating Lease
Vehicles

Vehicles that
are leased as part of our leasing program, are classified as
operating lease vehicles. Operating lease vehicles are recorded at
cost less accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is computed using
the straight-line method over the term of the operating leases
of three years. The total cost of operating lease vehicles recorded
in the consolidated balance sheets as of December 31, 2012 and
2011 was $13.4 million and $13.7 million, respectively. Accumulated
depreciation related to leased vehicles as of December 31,
2012 and 2011 was $3.3 million and $2.0 million,
respectively.
 |
| **      Intangible Assets** | Intangible
Assets

Intangible
assets with finite useful lives are amortized over their estimated
useful lives. As of December 31, 2012 and 2011, intangible
assets are comprised of emission permits related to our Tesla
Factory. These emission permits are related to the operation of our
Tesla Factory and therefore, are amortized over the same useful
life.
 |
| **      Long-lived Assets** | Long-lived
Assets

We evaluate our
long-lived assets, including intangible assets, for indicators of
possible impairment when events or changes in circumstances
indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable.
Impairment exists if the carrying amounts of such assets exceed the
estimates of future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be
generated by such assets. Should impairment exist, the impairment
loss would be measured based on the excess carrying value of the
asset over the asset’s estimated fair value. As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, we have not recorded any
impairment losses on our long-lived assets.
 |
|       Research and Development Costs | Research and Development
Costs

Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. Research and
development expenses consist primarily of payroll, benefits and
stock-based compensation of those employees engaged in research,
design and development activities, costs related to design tools,
license expenses related to intellectual property, supplies and
services, depreciation and other occupancy costs. Also included in
research and development are development services costs incurred,
if any, prior to the finalization of agreements with our
development services customers as reaching a final agreement and
revenue recognition is not assured. Development services costs
incurred after the finalization of an agreement are recorded in
cost of revenues.
 |
| **      Advertising and Promotion Costs** | Advertising and
Promotion Costs

Advertising and
sales promotion costs are expensed as incurred. During the years
ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, advertising, promotion
and related marketing expenses were $3.9 million, $2.9 million and
$3.1 million, respectively.
 |
| **      Income Taxes** | Income
Taxes

Income taxes
are computed using the asset and liability method, under which
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the
difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets
and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in
which the differences are expected to affect taxable income.
Valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be
realized.

We record
liabilities related to uncertain tax positions when, despite our
belief that our tax return positions are supportable, we believe
that it is more likely than not that those positions may not be
fully sustained upon review by tax authorities. Accrued interest
and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits are classified
as income tax expense.
 |
|       Stock-based Compensation | Stock-based
Compensation

We recognize
compensation expense for costs related to all share-based payments,
including stock options. The fair value of share-based payment
awards are estimated on the grant date using an option pricing
model. Stock-based compensation expense is recognized on a
straight-line basis over the service period, net of estimated
forfeitures.

We have elected
to use the “with and without” approach in determining
the order in which tax attributes are utilized. As a result, we
will only recognize a tax benefit from stock-based awards in
additional paid-in capital if an incremental tax benefit is
realized after all other tax attributes currently available to us
have been utilized. In addition, we have elected to account for the
indirect effects of stock-based awards on other tax attributes,
such as the research tax credit, through our consolidated statement
of operations.

We account for
equity instruments issued to non-employees based on the fair value
of the awards. The fair value of the awards granted to
non-employees is re-measured as the awards vest and the resulting
change in fair value, if any, is recognized in the consolidated
statements of operations during the period the related services are
rendered.

For
performance-based awards, stock-based compensation expense is
recognized over the expected performance achievement period of
individual performance milestones when the achievement of each
individual performance milestone becomes probable.

In August 2012,
our Board of Directors granted stock options to Elon Musk, our
Product Architect and Chief Executive Officer (CEO Grant) subject
to a vesting schedule based entirely on performance and market
conditions. The stock-based compensation expense associated with
the CEO Grant is recognized over the longer of the expected
achievement period of the performance and market conditions as the
relevant performance condition is probable of being met (see Note
10).
 |
| **      Foreign Currency Remeasurement and Transactions** | Foreign Currency
Remeasurement and Transactions

For each of our
foreign subsidiaries, the functional currency is the U. S. Dollar.
For these foreign subsidiaries, monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in non-U. S. currencies are re-measured to U. S. Dollars
using current exchange rates in effect at the balance sheet date.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in non-U. S.
currencies are maintained at historical U. S.  Dollar exchange
rates. Revenues and expenses are re-measured at average
U. S.  Dollar monthly rates.

Foreign
currency transaction gains and losses are a result of the effect of
exchange rate changes on transactions denominated in currencies
other than the functional currency. Transaction gains and losses
are recognized in other expense, net in the consolidated statements
of operations and have not been significant for any periods
presented.

We hedge a
portion of our foreign currency exposures related to outstanding
monetary assets and liabilities using foreign currency exchange
forward contracts. In general, the market risk related to these
contracts is offset by corresponding gains and losses on the hedged
transactions. The credit risk associated with these contracts is
driven by changes in interest and currency exchange rates and, as a
result, varies over time. These contracts are not designated as
hedges, and as a result, changes in their fair value are recorded
in other expense, net, on our consolidated statements of
operations.  We do not enter into derivative contracts for
trading purposes.
 |
| **      Comprehensive Loss** | Comprehensive
Loss

Comprehensive
loss is comprised of net loss and other comprehensive loss. Other
comprehensive loss consists of unrealized gains and losses on our
available-for-sale marketable securities that have been excluded
from the determination of net loss.
 |
|       Warranties | Warranties

We began
recording warranty reserves with the commencement of Tesla Roadster
sales in 2008. Initially, Tesla Roadsters were sold with a warranty
of three years or 36,000 miles, which we extended to four years or
50,000 miles for the purchasers of our 2008 Tesla Roadster. Tesla
Roadster customers had the opportunity to purchase an Extended
Service plan for the period after the end of the New Vehicle
Limited Warranty to cover additional services for an additional
three years or 36,000 miles, provided they are purchased within a
specified period of time. In June 2012, we commenced deliveries of
Model S. Model S is sold with a warranty of four years or 50,000
miles for most vehicle components and covers the battery
pack for a period of eight years or 100,000 miles, 125,000
miles or unlimited miles, depending on the size of the
vehicle’s battery, although the battery pack’s charging
capacity is not covered under the New Vehicle Limited Warranty or
any Extended Service plan. Accrued warranty activity consisted of
the following for the periods presented (in thousands):

                                    Year Ended

We provide a
warranty on all vehicle, production powertrain components and
systems sales, and we accrue warranty reserves at the time a
vehicle or production powertrain component is delivered to the
customer. Warranty reserves include management’s best
estimate of the projected costs to repair or to replace any items
under warranty, based on actual warranty experience as it becomes
available and other known factors that may impact our evaluation of
historical data. We review our reserves at least quarterly to
ensure that our accruals are adequate in meeting expected future
warranty obligations, and we will adjust our estimates as needed.
Warranty expense is recorded as a component of cost of revenues in
the consolidated statements of operations. The portion of the
warranty provision which is expected to be incurred within 12
months from the balance sheet date is classified as current, while
the remaining amount is classified as long-term.
 |
|       Environmental Liabilities | Environmental
Liabilities

We are subject
to federal and state laws and regulations for the protection of the
environment, including those related to the discharge of hazardous
materials and remediation of contaminated sites. In October 2010,
we completed the purchase of our Tesla Factory located in Fremont,
California from New United Motor Manufacturing, Inc. (NUMMI). NUMMI
has previously identified environmental conditions at the Fremont
site which affect soil and groundwater. As the owner of the Fremont
site, we may be responsible for the entire investigation and
remediation of any environmental contamination at the Fremont site,
whether it occurred before or after the date we purchased the
property. Upon the completion of the purchase in October 2010, we
recorded the fair value of the environmental liabilities that we
estimated to be $5.3 million. The fair value of these liabilities
was determined based on an expected value analysis of the related
potential costs to investigate, remediate and manage various
environmental conditions that were identified as part of
NUMMI’s facility decommissioning activities as well as our
own diligence efforts. Estimated potential costs are not discounted
to present value as the timing of payments cannot be reasonably
estimated.

| **      Net Loss per Share of Common Stock** | Net Loss per Share of
Common Stock

Our basic and
diluted net loss per share of common stock is calculated by
dividing net loss by the weighted-average shares of common stock
outstanding for the period. Potentially dilutive shares, which are
based on the number of shares underlying outstanding stock options
and warrants, are not included when their effect is
antidilutive.

The following
table presents the potential common shares outstanding that were
excluded from the computation of basic and diluted net loss per
share of common stock for the periods presented:
