In June 2010, our
registration statement on Form S-1 for our IPO was declared
effective by the Securities and Exchange Commission. As a result,
the number of authorized shares of our common stock increased from
106,666,667 to 2,000,000,000 shares.

In July 2010, we completed
the IPO of common stock in which we sold a total of 11,880,600
shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of $188.8
million from this transaction, net of underwriting discounts and
commissions. Concurrent with the closing of our IPO, we also sold
2,941,176 shares of our common stock to Toyota in a private
placement and received cash proceeds of $50.0 million. As a result
of the IPO, our convertible preferred stock was automatically
converted into common stock and our outstanding warrants, excluding
the DOE warrant, were net exercised.

In November 2010, we
entered into a common stock purchase agreement with an entity
affiliated with Panasonic Corporation (Panasonic) pursuant to which
we issued and sold an aggregate of 1,418,573 shares of our common
stock at a price of $21.15 per share, which was the average of the
trading highs and lows of our common stock from October 25 to
October 29, 2010. Upon completion of the private placement
transaction on November 2, we received aggregate proceeds of
$30.0 million. Concurrently with the sale and issuance of the
shares to Panasonic, we amended our investors’ rights
agreement as of November 2, 2010 to grant Panasonic
registration rights on a pari passu basis with certain other
holders of registration rights with respect to the shares of common
stock purchased in the private placement.

In June 2011, we completed
a follow-on offering of common stock in which we sold a total of
6,095,000 shares of our common stock and received cash proceeds of
$172.7 million from this transaction, net of underwriting
discounts. Concurrent with this offering, we also sold 1,416,000
shares of our common stock to our CEO and 637,475 shares of our
common stock to Blackstar InvestCo LLC, an affiliate of Daimler and
received total cash proceeds of $59.1 million in the private
placements. No underwriting discounts or commissions were paid in
connection with these private placements.

In October 2012, we
completed a follow-on offering of common stock in which we sold a
total of 7,964,601 shares of our common stock and received cash
proceeds of $222.1 million (which includes 35,398 shares or $1.0
million sold to our CEO) from this transaction, net of underwriting
discounts and offering costs.

Stockholder
Settlement

During the three months
ended March 31, 2010, three of our stockholders who are
affiliated with one of our Board members asserted a claim regarding
the conversion of such stockholders’ convertible promissory
notes into shares of our Series  E convertible preferred stock
at the time of our Series  E preferred stock financing in May
2009. In May 2010, we entered into a settlement agreement with
these stockholders and pursuant to the terms of the settlement
agreement, we issued warrants to such stockholders which, upon the
closing of our IPO in July 2010, were automatically net exercised
for an aggregate of 100,000 shares of our common stock. During the
three months ended June 30, 2010, the fair value of these
warrants in the amount of $1.7 million was recorded in equity
on the consolidated balance sheet based on a Black-Scholes
valuation. In conjunction with the settlement of our liability to
issue such warrants, we recognized a charge of $1.1 million during
the year ended December 31, 2010, through other expense, net,
on the consolidated statement of operations.
