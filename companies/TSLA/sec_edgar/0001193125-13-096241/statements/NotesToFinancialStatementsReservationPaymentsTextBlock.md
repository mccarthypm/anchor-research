Payments

Reservation
payments consist of payments that allow potential customers to hold
a reservation for the future purchase of a Model S, Model X or
Tesla Roadster. These amounts are recorded as current liabilities
until the vehicle is delivered. For Model S and Model X, we require
an initial fully refundable reservation payment of at least $5,000.
The reservation payment becomes a nonrefundable deposit once the
customer has selected the vehicle specifications and enters into a
purchase agreement. We require full payment of the purchase price
of the vehicle only upon delivery of the vehicle to the customer.
Amounts received by us as reservation payments are generally not
restricted as to their use by us. Upon delivery of the vehicle, the
related reservation payments are applied against the
customer’s total purchase price for the vehicle and
recognized in automotive sales as part of the respective vehicle
sale.

As of
December 31, 2012 and 2011, we held reservation payments of
$138.8 million and $91.8 million, respectively. In order to convert
the reservation payments into revenue, we will need to sell
vehicles to these customers.
