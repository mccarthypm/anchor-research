Loan Facility

On January 20, 2010,
we entered into a loan facility with the Federal Financing Bank
(FFB), and the DOE, pursuant to the Advanced Technology Vehicles
Manufacturing (ATVM) Incentive Program. This loan facility was
amended in June 2011 to expand our cash investment options, in
February 2012 to modify the timing of certain future financial
covenants and funding of the debt service reserve account, and in
June and December 2012 to allow us to effect certain initiatives in
our business plan. In September 2012, we entered into an amendment
with the DOE to remove our obligation to comply with the current
ratio financial covenant as of September 30, 2012 and amend
the timing of pre-funding the principal payment due in June 2013.
We entered into another amendment with the DOE in  March 2013
that, among other things, modified certain future financial
covenants, accelerated the maturity date of the DOE Loan Facility
to December 15, 2017, created an obligation to repay
approximately 1.0% of the outstanding principal under the DOE Loan
Facility on or before June 15, 2013, and created additional
contingent obligations based on excess cash flows that may result
in accelerated repayment of the DOE Loan Facility starting in 2015.
The original amortization schedule for the DOE Loan Facility is not
affected by this recent amendment, and so the debt service payments
remain the same until the new maturity date when
all outstanding loans under the DOE  Loan
Facility are to be repaid.   We refer to the loan
facility with the DOE, as amended, as the DOE Loan Facility. Under
the DOE Loan Facility, the FFB has made available to us two
multi-draw term loan facilities in an aggregate principal amount of
$465.0 million. An aggregate principal amount of $101.2 million was
made available under the first term loan facility to finance up to
80% of the costs eligible for funding for the powertrain
engineering and the build out of a facility to design and
manufacture lithium-ion battery packs, electric motors and electric
components (the Powertrain Facility). Aggregate principal amount of
$363.9 million was made available under the second term loan
facility to finance up to 80% of the costs eligible for funding for
the development of, and to build out the manufacturing facility
for, our Model S sedan (the Model S Facility). Under the DOE Loan
Facility, we are responsible for the remaining 20% of the costs
eligible for funding under the ATVM Program for the projects as
well as any cost overruns for each project. As of August 31,
2012, we have fully drawn down the aforementioned
facilities.

Our DOE Loan Facility
draw-downs have been as follows (in thousands):

Advances under the DOE Loan
Facility accrue interest at a per annum rate determined by the
Secretary of the Treasury as of the date of the advance and will be
based on the Treasury yield curve and the scheduled principal
installments for such advance. Interest on advances under the DOE
Loan Facility is payable quarterly in arrears. Advances under the
Powertrain Facility are repayable in 21 equal quarterly
installments commencing on December 15, 2012. All outstanding
amounts under the Powertrain Facility will be due and payable on
the maturity date of December 15, 2017. Advances under the
Model S Facility are repayable in 21 equal quarterly installments
commencing on December 15, 2012. All outstanding amounts under
the Model S Facility will be due and payable on the maturity date
of December 15, 2017. Advances under the loan facilities may
be voluntarily prepaid at any time at a price determined based on
interest rates at the time of prepayment for loans made from the
Secretary of the Treasury to FFB for obligations with an identical
payment schedule to the advance being prepaid, which could result
in the advance being prepaid at a discount, at par or at a premium.
The loan facilities are subject to mandatory prepayment with net
cash proceeds received from certain dispositions, loss events with
respect to property and other extraordinary receipts. All
obligations under the DOE Loan Facility are secured by
substantially all of our property.

The DOE Loan Facility
documents contain customary covenants that include, among others, a
requirement that the projects be conducted in accordance with the
business plan for such project, compliance with all requirements of
the ATVM Program, and limitations on our and our
subsidiaries’ ability to incur indebtedness, incur liens,
make investments or loans, enter into mergers or acquisitions,
dispose of assets, pay dividends or make distributions on capital
stock, pay indebtedness, pay management, advisory or similar fees
to affiliates, enter into certain affiliate transactions, enter
into new lines of business, and enter into certain restrictive
agreements, in each case subject to customary exceptions. The DOE
Loan Facility documents also contain customary financial covenants
requiring us to maintain a minimum ratio of current assets to
current liabilities, and (i) a limit on capital expenditures,
(ii) from December 31, 2013, a maximum leverage ratio, a
minimum interest coverage ratio, a minimum fixed charge coverage
ratio, and (iii) from March 31, 2014, a maximum ratio of
total liabilities to shareholder equity. We were in compliance with
our current applicable financial covenants as of December 31,
2012. The DOE Loan Facility documents also contain customary events
of default, subject in some cases to customary cure periods for
certain defaults. In addition, events of default include a failure
of Elon Musk, our Chief Executive Officer (CEO), Product Architect
and Chairman, and certain of his affiliates, at any time prior to
one year after we complete the project relating to the Model S
Facility, to own at least 65% of capital stock held by
Mr.  Musk and such affiliates as of the date of the DOE Loan
Facility. As part of the most recent amendment to the DOE Loan
Facility in  March 2013, we agreed to, among other things,
(i) make an early payment of approximately 1.0% of the
outstanding principal under the DOE Loan Facility on or before
June 15, 2013, (ii) make additional quarterly prepayments
equal to: 20% of our excess cash flow for each quarter of fiscal
2015; and 30% of our excess cash flow for each quarter of fiscal
2016 and 2017.

Under the DOE Loan
Facility, we have agreed to fund a dedicated debt service reserve
account. In February 2012, we pre-funded $15.0 million into this
account, an amount equal to all principal and interest that came
due on December 15, 2012. In October 2012, we also pre-funded
$14.2 million into this account, an amount equal to all principal
and interest that will come due on March 15, 2013 in
accordance with the pre-funding requirement under the DOE Loan
Facility. Most recently, in February 2013, we pre-funded $14.6
million into this account, an amount equal to all principal and
interest that will come due on June 15,
2013.

In addition, we have agreed
to make additional payments, beginning June 15, 2013, of
between $14.2 million to $14.5 million each quarter to pre-fund the
quarterly principal and interest payments that will be due from
September 15, 2013 through December 15, 2014. Once we
have deposited such amounts, we will not be required to further
pre-fund such debt service reserve account. As of December 31,
2012, $14.9 million was held in this dedicated account. We have
classified this cash as current restricted cash on the consolidated
balance sheet.

DOE
Warrant

In connection with the
closing of the DOE Loan Facility, we have issued a warrant to
the DOE to purchase shares of our common stock at an
exercise price of $7.54 per share and a warrant to purchase up
to 5,100 shares of our common stock at an exercise price of
$8.94 per share. Beginning on December 15, 2018 and until
December 14, 2022, the shares subject to purchase under these
warrants will become exercisable in quarterly amounts
depending on the average outstanding balance of the loan during the
prior quarter. These warrants may be exercised until
December 15, 2023. If we prepay the DOE Loan Facility in part
or in full, the total amount of shares exercisable under the
warrants will be reduced.

Since the number of shares
ultimately issuable under the warrant will vary depending on the
average outstanding balance of the loan during the contractual
vesting period, and decisions to prepay would be influenced by our
future stock price as well as the interest rates on our loans in
relation to market interest rates, we measured the fair value of
the warrant using a Monte Carlo simulation approach. The Monte
Carlo approach simulates and captures the optimal decisions to be
made between prepaying the DOE loan and the cancellation of the DOE
warrant. For the purposes of the simulation, the optimal decision
represents the scenario with the lowest economic cost to us. The
total warrant value would then be calculated as the average warrant
payoff across all simulated paths discounted to our valuation
date.

The prepayment feature
which allows us to prepay the DOE Loan Facility and consequently,
affect the number of shares ultimately issuable under the DOE
warrant, was determined to represent an embedded derivative. This
embedded derivative is inherently valued and accounted for as part
of the warrant liability on our consolidated balance sheets.
Changes to the fair value of the embedded derivative are reflected
as part of the warrant liability re-measurement to fair value at
each balance sheet reporting date.

The warrant is recorded at
its estimated fair value with changes in its fair value reflected
in other expense, net, until its expiration or vesting. The fair
value of the warrant at issuance was $6.3 million, and along with
the DOE Loan Facility fee of $0.5 million and other debt
issuance costs of $0.9 million, represents a cost of closing the
loan facility and is being amortized to interest expense over the
expected term of the DOE Loan Facility of approximately 13 years.
During the years ended December 31, 2012, 2011 and 2010, we
amortized $0.6 million to income expense,
respectively.

The DOE warrant will
continue to be recorded at its estimated fair value with changes in
the fair value reflected in other expense, net, as the number of
shares of common stock ultimately issuable under the warrant is
variable until its expiration or vesting. As of December 31,
2012 and 2011, the fair value of the DOE warrant was $10.7 million
and $8.8 million, respectively. During the years ended
December 31, 2012 and 2011, we recognized expense for the
change in the fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of $1.9
million and $2.8 million through other expense, net, in the
consolidated statements of operations, respectively. During the
year ended December 31, 2010, we recognized income from the
change in the fair value of the DOE warrant in the amount of $0.2
million through other expense, net, in the consolidated statement
of operations.
