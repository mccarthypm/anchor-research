Preparation

The accompanying
consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the
Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been
eliminated. The preparation of these consolidated financial
statements in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting
principles (“ GAAP”) requires management to make
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in these
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes. Actual
results could differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior
year amounts in the consolidated financial statements and notes
thereto have been reclassified to conform to the current
year’s presentation.

The
Company’s fiscal year is the 52 or 53-week period that ends
on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years
2011, 2010 and 2009 ended on September 24,
2011,  September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009,
respectively, and included 52 weeks each. An additional week is
included in the first fiscal quarter approximately every six years
to realign fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Fiscal year 2012
will end on September 29, 2012, and will span 53 weeks, with a
14th week added to the first quarter of 2012. Unless otherwise
stated, references to particular years or quarters refer to the
Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated
quarters of those fiscal years.

During the first
quarter of 2011, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting
Standard Board’s (“ FASB”) new accounting
standard on consolidation of variable interest
entities.  This new accounting standard eliminates the
mandatory quantitative approach in determining control
for evaluating whether variable interest entities need to be
consolidated in favor of a qualitative analysis, and requires
an ongoing reassessment of control over such entities. The
adoption of this new accounting standard did not impact the
Company’s consolidated financial statements.

| **      Revenue Recognition, Policy** | Revenue
Recognition

Net sales
consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software,
digital content and applications, peripherals, and service and
support contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive
evidence of an arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales
price is fixed or determinable, and collection is probable. Product
is considered delivered to the customer once it has been shipped
and title and risk of loss have been transferred. For most of the
Company’s product sales, these criteria are met at the time
the product is shipped. For online sales to individuals, for some
sales to education customers in the U. S., and for certain other
sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the
product because the Company legally retains a portion of the risk
of loss on these sales during transit. The Company recognizes
revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled with
hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware,
and third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in
accordance with general revenue recognition accounting guidance.
The Company recognizes revenue in accordance with industry specific
software accounting guidance for the following types of sales
transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products,
(ii) sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of
software bundled with hardware not essential to the functionality
of the hardware.

The Company
sells software and peripheral products obtained from other
companies. The Company generally establishes its own pricing and
retains related inventory risk, is the primary obligor in sales
transactions with its customers, and assumes the credit risk for
amounts billed to its customers. Accordingly, the Company generally
recognizes revenue for the sale of products obtained from other
companies based on the gross amount billed. For sales of
third-party software applications for iPhone, iPad and iPod touch
(“iOS devices”) and Macs made through the App Store and
the Mac App Store, the Company is not the primary obligor to users
of the software, and third- party developers determine the selling
price of their software. Therefore, the Company accounts for such
sales on a net basis by recognizing only the commission it retains
from each sale and including that commission in net sales in the
Consolidated Statements of Operations. The portion of the sales
price paid by users that is remitted by the Company to third-party
developers is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated
Statements of Operations.

The Company
records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of
the delivery of products or the performance of services. This
includes amounts that have been deferred for unspecified and
specified software upgrade rights and non-software services that
are attached to hardware and software products. The Company sells
gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also
sells gift cards redeemable on the iTunes Store for the purchase of
content and software. The Company records deferred revenue upon the
sale of the card, which is relieved upon redemption of the card by
the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and support contracts
is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods.
AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended
phone support, repair services, web-based support resources and
diagnostic tools offered under the Company’s standard limited
warranty.

The Company
records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to
price protection and for customer incentive programs, including
reseller and end-user rebates, and other sales programs and
volume-based incentives. The estimated cost of these programs is
recognized in the period the Company has sold the product and
committed to a plan. The Company also records reductions to revenue
for expected future product returns based on the Company’s
historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of taxes collected
from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, with
the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted
to the relevant government authority.

Revenue Recognition for
Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

For
multi-element arrangements that include hardware products
containing software essential to the hardware product’s
functionality, undelivered software elements that relate to the
hardware product’s essential software, and undelivered
non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all
deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such
circumstances, the Company uses a hierarchy to determine the
selling price to be used for allocating revenue to deliverables:
(i) vendor-specific objective evidence of fair value
(“ VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling
price (“ TPE”), and (iii) best estimate of the
selling price (“ ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when
the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price
actually charged by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect
the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of
elements would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone
basis.

For sales of
iPhone, iPad, Apple TV, for sales of iPod touch beginning in June
2010, and for sales of Mac beginning in June 2011, the Company has
indicated it may from time-to-time provide future unspecified
software upgrades and features to the essential software bundled
with each of these hardware products free of charge to customers.
Essential software for iOS devices includes iOS and related
applications and for Mac includes Mac OS X and iLife. In June 2011,
the Company announced it would provide various non-software
services to owners of qualifying versions of iOS devices and Mac.
The Company has identified up to three deliverables in arrangements
involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable is the
hardware and software essential to the functionality of the
hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second
deliverable is the embedded right included with the purchase of iOS
devices, Mac and Apple TV to receive on a when-and-if-available
basis, future unspecified software upgrades and features relating
to the product’s essential software. The third deliverable is
the non-software services to be provided to qualifying versions of
iOS devices and Mac. The Company allocates revenue between these
deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the
Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the
allocation of revenue has been based on the Company’s ESPs.
Amounts allocated to the delivered hardware and the related
essential software are recognized at the time of sale provided the
other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Amounts
allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and
the non-software services are deferred and recognized on a
straight-line basis over the estimated lives of each of these
devices, which range from 24 to 48 months. Cost of sales related to
delivered hardware and related essential software, including
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs
incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as cost of
sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs
are recognized as operating expenses as incurred.

The
Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables
without VSOE or TPE considers multiple factors that may vary
depending upon the unique facts and circumstances related to each
deliverable. The Company believes its customers, particularly
consumers, would be reluctant to buy unspecified software upgrade
rights related to iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV. This view is
primarily based on the fact that unspecified upgrade rights do not
obligate the Company to provide upgrades at a particular time or at
all, and do not specify to customers which upgrades or features
will be delivered. The Company also believes its customers would be
unwilling to pay a significant amount for access to the
non-software services because other companies offer similar
services at little or no cost to users. Therefore, the Company has
concluded that if it were to sell upgrade rights or access to the
non-software services on a standalone basis, including those rights
and services attached to iOS devices, Mac and Apple TV, the selling
prices would be relatively low. Key factors considered by the
Company in developing the ESPs for software upgrade rights include
prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends
for pricing of Mac and iOS compatible software, the Company’s
historical pricing practices, the nature of the upgrade rights
(e. g., unspecified and when-and-if-available), and the relative ESP
of the upgrade rights as compared to the total selling price of the
product. The Company may also consider, when appropriate, the
impact of other products and services, including advertising
services, on selling price assumptions when developing and
reviewing its ESPs for software upgrade rights and related
deliverables. The Company may also consider additional factors as
appropriate, including the pricing of competitive alternatives if
they exist and product-specific business objectives. When relevant,
the same factors are considered by the Company in developing ESPs
for offerings such as the non-software services; however, the
primary consideration in developing ESPs for the non-software
services is the estimated cost to provide such services over the
estimated life of the related devices, including consideration for
a reasonable profit margin.

Beginning with
the Company’s June 2011 announcement of the upcoming release
of the non-software services and Mac OS X Lion, the Company’s
combined ESP for the unspecified software upgrade rights and the
right to receive the non-software services are as follows: $16 for
iPhone and iPad, $11 for iPod touch, and $22 for Mac. The
Company’s ESP for the embedded unspecified software upgrade
right included with each Apple TV is $5 for 2011 and $10 for fiscal
years prior to 2011. Amounts allocated to the embedded unspecified
software upgrade rights and the non-software services associated
with iOS devices and Apple TV are recognized on a straight-line
basis over 24 months, and amounts allocated to the embedded
unspecified software upgrade rights and the non-software services
associated with Macs are recognized on a straight-line basis over
48 months.

The
Company’s ESP for the software upgrade right included with
each iPhone sold beginning with the introduction of iPhone in June
2007 through the Company’s second quarter of 2010 was $25.
Beginning in April 2010 in conjunction with the Company’s
announcement of iOS 4 for iPhone, the Company lowered its ESP for
the software upgrade right included with each iPhone to $10.
Beginning with initial sales of iPad in April 2010, the
Company’s ESP for the embedded software upgrade right
included with the sale of each iPad is $10, and the Company’s
ESP for the embedded software upgrade right included with each iPod
touch sold beginning in June 2010 is $5.

The Company
accounts for multiple element arrangements that consist only of
software or software-related products, including the sale of
upgrades to previously sold software, in accordance with industry
specific software accounting guidance. For such transactions,
revenue on arrangements that include multiple elements is allocated
to each element based on the relative fair value of each element,
and fair value is determined by VSOE. If the Company cannot
objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element
included in such multiple-element arrangements, the Company defers
revenue until all elements are delivered and services have been
performed, or until fair value can objectively be determined for
any remaining undelivered elements. Beginning in July 2011, the
sale of certain upgrades to Mac OS X and Mac versions of iLife
include when-and-if-available upgrade rights for which the Company
does not have VSOE. Therefore, beginning in July 2011 the Company
defers all revenue from the sale of upgrades to the Mac OS and Mac
versions of iLife and recognizes it ratably over 36
months.
 |
| **      Shipping Costs, Policy** | Shipping
Costs

For all periods
presented, amounts billed to customers related to shipping and
handling are classified as revenue, and the Company’s
shipping and handling costs are included in cost of
sales.
 |
|       Warranty Expense, Policy | Warranty
Expense

The Company
generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software
warranties at the time the related revenue is recognized. The
Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing warranty
liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on actual
experience and changes in future estimates.
 |
| **      Software Development Costs, Policy** | Software Development
Costs

Research and
development costs are expensed as incurred. Development costs of
computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are
subject to capitalization beginning when a product’s
technological feasibility has been established and ending when a
product is available for general release to customers. In most
instances, the Company’s products are released soon after
technological feasibility has been established. Therefore, costs
incurred subsequent to achievement of technological feasibility are
usually not significant, and generally most software development
costs have been expensed as incurred.

The Company did
not capitalize any software development costs during 2011 and 2010.
In 2009, the Company capitalized $71 million of costs associated
with the development of Mac OS X Version 10.6 Snow Leopard
(“ Mac OS X Snow Leopard”), which was released during
the fourth quarter of 2009. The capitalized costs are being
amortized to cost of sales on a straight-line basis over a three
year estimated useful life of the underlying technology.

Total
amortization related to capitalized software development costs was
$30 million, $48 million and $25 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.
 |
| **      Advertising Costs, Policy** | Advertising
Costs

Advertising
costs are expensed as incurred. Advertising expense was $933
million, $691 million and $501 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.
 |
| **      Share-Based Compensation, Policy** | Share-based
Compensation

The Company
recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in
which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity
instruments of the Company or (b) liabilities that are based
on the fair value of the enterprise’s equity instruments or
that may be settled by the issuance of such equity instruments.
Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock units
(“ RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market
value of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
Share-based compensation cost for stock options is estimated at the
grant date based on each option’s fair-value as calculated by
the Black-Scholes-Merton (“ BSM”) option-pricing model.
The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost as expense
ratably on a straight-line basis over the requisite service period.
The Company recognizes a benefit from share-based compensation in
the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity if an
incremental tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company
recognizes the indirect effects of share-based compensation on
research and development tax credits, foreign tax credits and
domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation
can be found in Note 6, “ Shareholders’ Equity and
Share-based Compensation” of this Form 10-K.
 |
| **      Income Taxes, Policy** | Income
Taxes

The provision
for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method,
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for
the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences
between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and
liabilities, and for operating losses and tax credit carryforwards.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the
currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect
for the years in which those tax assets are expected to be realized
or settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce
deferred tax assets to the amount that is believed more likely than
not to be realized.

The Company
recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if
it is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on
examination by the taxing authorities, based on the technical
merits of the position. The tax benefits recognized in the
financial statements from such positions are then measured based on
the largest benefit that has a greater than 50% likelihood of being
realized upon settlement. See Note 5, “ Income Taxes” of
this Form 10-K for additional information.
 |
| **      Earnings Per Common Share, Policy** | Earnings Per Common
Share

Basic earnings
per common share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per common
share is computed by dividing income available to common
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common
stock outstanding during the period increased to include the number
of additional shares of common stock that would have been
outstanding if the potentially dilutive securities had been issued.
Potentially dilutive securities include outstanding stock options,
shares to be purchased under the employee stock purchase plan and
unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive
securities is reflected in diluted earnings per common share by
application of the treasury stock method. Under the treasury stock
method, an increase in the fair market value of the Company’s
common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from
potentially dilutive securities.
 |
| **      Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities, Policy** | Cash Equivalents and
Marketable Securities

All highly
liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The
Company’s marketable debt and equity securities have been
classified and accounted for as available-for-sale. Management
determines the appropriate classification of its investments at the
time of purchase and reevaluates the designations at each balance
sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities
as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s
underlying contractual maturity date. Marketable debt securities
with maturities of 12 months or less are classified as short-term
and marketable debt securities with maturities greater than 12
months are classified as long-term. The Company classifies its
marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, as either
short-term or long-term based on the nature of each security and
its availability for use in current operations. The Company’s
marketable debt and equity securities are carried at fair value,
with the unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported as a
component of shareholders’ equity. The cost of securities
sold is based upon the specific identification method.
 |
| **      Derivative Financial Instruments, Policy** | Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company
accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or
liabilities and carries them at fair value.

For derivative
instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected
future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the
effective portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument
is reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive
income (“ AOCI”) in shareholders’ equity and
reclassified into income in the same period or periods during which
the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective portion of
the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is
recognized in current income. To receive hedge accounting
treatment, cash flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting
changes to expected future cash flows on hedged transactions. For
options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time value
are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and are
recognized in income. For derivative instruments that hedge the
exposure to changes in the fair value of an asset or a liability
and that are designated as fair value hedges, both the net gain or
loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain or
loss on the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk are
recognized in earnings in the current period. The Company had no
fair value hedges in 2011, 2010 and 2009. The net gain or loss on
the effective portion of a derivative instrument that is designated
as an economic hedge of the foreign currency translation exposure
of the net investment in a foreign operation is reported in the
same manner as a foreign currency translation adjustment. For
forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the
Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the
forward carry component from its definition of effectiveness.
Accordingly, any gains or losses related to this component are
recognized in current income. Derivatives that do not qualify as
hedges must be adjusted to fair value through current
income.
 |
| **      Allowance For Doubtful Accounts, Policy** | Allowance for Doubtful
Accounts

The Company
records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its
assessment of various factors. The Company considers historical
experience, the age of the accounts receivable balances, credit
quality of the Company’s customers, current economic
conditions, and other factors that may affect customers’
ability to pay.
 |
| **      Inventories, Policy** | Inventories

Inventories are
stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, first-out
method, or market. If the cost of the inventories exceeds their
market value, provisions are made currently for the difference
between the cost and the market value. The Company’s
inventories consist primarily of components and finished goods for
all periods presented.
 |
| **      Property, Plant and Equipment, Policy** | Property, Plant and
Equipment

Property, plant
and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by use
of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the
assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 30 years or the
remaining life of the underlying building, up to five years for
equipment, and the shorter of lease terms or ten years for
leasehold improvements. The Company capitalizes eligible costs to
acquire or develop internal-use software that are incurred
subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs
related to internal-use software are amortized using the
straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets,
which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization
expense on property and equipment was $1.6 billion, $815 million
and $606 million during 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.
 |
| **      Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Asset, Policy** | Long-Lived Assets
Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible
Assets

The Company
reviews property, plant and equipment and certain identifiable
intangibles, excluding goodwill, for impairment. Long-lived assets
are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in
circumstances indicate the carrying amount of an asset may not be
recoverable. Recoverability of these assets is measured by
comparison of their carrying amounts to future undiscounted cash
flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant and
equipment and certain identifiable intangibles are considered to be
impaired, the impairment to be recognized equals the amount by
which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair market
value. The Company did not record any significant impairments
during 2011, 2010 and 2009.

The Company
does not amortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite
useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for
impairment at least annually or sooner whenever events or changes
in circumstances indicate that the assets may be impaired. The
Company performs its goodwill and intangible asset impairment tests
in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year. The Company did not
recognize any goodwill or intangible asset impairment charges in
2011, 2010 and 2009. The Company established reporting units based
on its current reporting structure. For purposes of testing
goodwill for impairment, goodwill has been allocated to these
reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting
unit.

The Company
amortizes its intangible assets with definite lives over their
estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The
Company is currently amortizing its acquired intangible assets with
definite lives over periods generally ranging between three to
seven years.
 |
| **      Fair Value Measurements, Policy** | Fair Value
Measurements

The Company
applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and
liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are
recognized or disclosed at fair value in the financial statements
on a recurring basis. The Company defines fair value as the price
that would be received from selling an asset or paid to transfer a
liability in an orderly transaction between market participants at
the measurement date. When determining the fair value measurements
for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at
fair value, the Company considers the principal or most
advantageous market in which the Company would transact and the
market-based risk measurements or assumptions that market
participants would use in pricing the asset or liability, such as
risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and
credit risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following
hierarchy, which prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value
into three levels and bases the categorization within the hierarchy
upon the lowest level of input that is available and significant to
the fair value measurement:

Level 1

Level 2

Level 3

The
Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were
derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair
value of all other financial instruments, all of which have
counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on
quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant
inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market
data.

In accordance
with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose
to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items
at fair value. The Company has not elected the fair value option
for any eligible financial instruments.
 |
| **      Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement, Policy** | Foreign Currency
Translation and Remeasurement

The Company
translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U. S. dollar
functional currency subsidiaries into U. S. dollars using exchange
rates in effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for
these subsidiaries are translated using rates that approximate
those in effect during the period. Gains and losses from these
translations are recognized in foreign currency translation
included in accumulated other comprehensive income in
shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries that
use the U. S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary
assets and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of
each period, and inventories, property, and nonmonetary assets and
liabilities at historical rates. Gains and losses from these
remeasurements were insignificant and have been included in the
Company’s results of operations.
 |
| **      Segment Information, Policy** | Segment
Information

The Company
reports segment information based on the “management”
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting
used by management for making decisions and assessing performance
as the source of the Company’s reportable segments.
Information about the Company’s products, major customers and
geographic areas on a company-wide basis is also
disclosed.
 |
| **      Derivatives, Policy** | Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company
uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to
foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign
exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted
revenue and cost of sales, on net investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and
liabilities.

To help protect
gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the U. S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign
currency revenue. The Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U. S. dollar and who sell in local currencies
may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not
denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The
Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases
generally up to six months.

To help protect
the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the
carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company may
also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses
generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities
denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting
considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from
movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company
records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value. The Company’s accounting policies for these
instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as
hedge or non-hedge instruments. The effective portions of cash flow
hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are
recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative
translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow
hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and
expense. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments
are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial
statement line item the derivative relates to.

The Company had
a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $290 million and a net deferred loss associated with
cash flow hedges of approximately $252 million, net of taxes,
recorded in AOCI as of September 24, 2011 and
September 25, 2010, respectively. Deferred gains and losses
associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are
recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the
related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses
related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized
as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related
costs are recognized. Substantially all of the Company’s
hedged transactions as of September 24, 2011 are expected to
occur within six months.

Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will
not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI
associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified
immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes
in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other
income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net
gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during 2011, 2010 and
2009.

The
Company’s unrealized net gains and losses on net investment
hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account
of AOCI, were not significant as of September 24, 2011 and
September 25, 2010, respectively. The ineffective portions and
amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment
hedges are recorded in other income and expense.
 |
| **      Comprehensive Income (Loss), Policy** | Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an
element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net
income. The Company’s other comprehensive income consists of
foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries
not using the U. S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities classified as
