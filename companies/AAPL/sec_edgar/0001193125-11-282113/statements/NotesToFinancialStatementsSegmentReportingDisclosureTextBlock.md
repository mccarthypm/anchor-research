| **      Segment Information and Geographic Data** | Note 8 Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company
reports segment information based on the “management”
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting
used by management for making decisions and assessing performance
as the source of the Company’s reportable
segments.

The Company
manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly,
the Company determined its reportable operating segments, which are
generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be
the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations.
The results of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific
reportable segments do not include results of the Retail segment.
The Americas segment includes both North and South America. The
Europe segment includes European countries, as well as the Middle
East and Africa. The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and
Asian countries, other than Japan. The Retail segment operates
Apple retail stores in 11 countries. Each reportable operating
segment provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the
same as those described in Note 1, “ Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.”

The Company
evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment
net sales are based on sales from the Company’s retail
stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to
third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are
generally included in the geographic segment in which the
expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed
outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment
operating income include various corporate expenses, such as
manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs,
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based
compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges,
and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The
Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments
for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate
assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term
marketable securities, other long-term investments, manufacturing
and corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and
other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment,
capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment. Cash payments for capital asset purchases by
the Retail segment were $612 million, $392 million and $369 million
for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

The Company has
certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as
high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as
vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of
their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores
require substantially more investment than the Company’s more
typical retail stores. The Company allocates certain operating
expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate
expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit. The
allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is based
on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of that
incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The Company had
opened a total of 19 high-profile stores as of September 24,
2011. Amounts allocated to corporate expense resulting from the
operations of high-profile stores were $102 million, $75 million
and $65 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.
