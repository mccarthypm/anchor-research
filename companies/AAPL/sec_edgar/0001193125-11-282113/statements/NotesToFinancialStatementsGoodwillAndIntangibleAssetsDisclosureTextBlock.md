During 2011 and
2010, the Company completed various business acquisitions. In 2011,
the aggregate cash consideration, net of cash acquired, was $244
million, of which $167 million was allocated to goodwill and $77
million to acquired intangible assets. In 2010, the aggregate cash
consideration, net of cash acquired, was $638 million, of which
$535 million was allocated to goodwill and $107 million to acquired

During 2011,
the Company, as part of a consortium, acquired Nortel Networks
Corporation’s patent portfolio for an overall purchase price
of $4.5 billion, of which the Company’s contribution was
approximately $2.6 billion. The majority of the acquisition price
has been recorded in acquired intangible assets, which the Company
expects to amortize over seven years. The Department of Justice is
reviewing this transaction.

The
Company’s gross carrying amount of goodwill was $896 million
and $741 million as of September 24, 2011 and
September 25, 2010, respectively. The Company did not have any
goodwill impairment during 2011, 2010 or 2009. The Company’s
goodwill is allocated primarily to the Americas and Europe
reportable operating segments.

Amortization
expense related to acquired intangible assets was $192 million, $69
million and $53 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. As of
September 24, 2011 the weighted-average amortization period
for acquired intangible assets was 6.2 years. The expected annual
amortization expense related to acquired intangible assets as of
September 24, 2011, is as follows (in millions):
