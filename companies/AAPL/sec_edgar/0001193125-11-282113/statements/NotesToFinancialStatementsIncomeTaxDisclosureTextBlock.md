The foreign
provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of
$24.0 billion, $13.0 billion and $6.6 billion in 2011, 2010 and
2009, respectively. The Company’s consolidated financial
statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that
may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U. S. As of
September 24, 2011, U. S. income taxes have not been provided
on a cumulative total of $23.4 billion of such earnings. The amount
of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary
differences is estimated to be approximately $8.0
billion.

As of
September 24, 2011 and September 25, 2010, $54.3 billion
and $30.8 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign
subsidiaries and are generally based in U. S. dollar-denominated
holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally
subject to U. S. income taxation on repatriation to the
U. S.

Deferred tax
assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits,
and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between
the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are
measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.

As of
September 24, 2011 and September 25, 2010, the
significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities were (in millions):

A

2011, 2010 and 2009) to income before provision for income taxes

The
Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the
Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference
between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of
the exercise and the option price, tax effected.  For RSUs, the
Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s
vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s
fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from
equity awards of $1.1 billion, $742 million and $246 million in
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, which were reflected as
increases to common stock.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

Tax positions
are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines
whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be
sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and
penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to
result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of
September 24, 2011, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits was $1.4 billion, of which $563 million, if recognized,
would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. As of
September 25, 2010, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits was $943 million, of which $404 million, if recognized,
would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate
changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which
excludes interest and penalties, for the three years ended
September 24, 2011, is as follows (in millions):

The Company
includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of
September 24, 2011 and September 25, 2010, the total
amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $261 million and
$247 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with
tax matters, the Company recognized interest expense in 2011 and
2009 of $14 million and $64 million, respectively, and in 2010 the
Company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million.

The Company is
subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S.
federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
For U. S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are
closed. The Internal Revenue Service (the “ IRS”) has
completed its field audit of the Company’s federal income tax
returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain
adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments
through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the
years 2007 through 2009. In addition, the Company is also subject
to audits by state, local and foreign tax authorities.  In
major states and major foreign jurisdictions, the years subsequent
to 1988 and 2001, respectively, generally remain open and could be
subject to examination by the taxing authorities.

Management
believes that an adequate provision has been made for any
adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any
issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in
a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the
Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in
the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the
resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company
does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized
tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months.
