The net
unrealized gains as of September 24, 2011 and
September 25, 2010 related primarily to long-term marketable
securities. The Company may sell certain of its marketable
securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons
including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration
and duration management. The Company recognized net realized gains
of $110 million during 2011 and no significant net realized gains
or losses during 2010 and 2009 related to such sales. The
maturities of the Company’s long-term marketable securities
generally range from one year to five years.

As of
September 24, 2011 and September 25, 2010, gross
unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in
a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not
significant.

The Company
considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities
investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company
typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its policy
generally limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer.
The Company’s investment policy requires investments to
generally be investment grade, with the primary objective of
minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were
determined for each individual security in the investment
portfolio. When evaluating the investments for other-than-temporary
impairment, the Company reviews factors such as the length of time
and extent to which fair value has been below cost basis, the
financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, and the
Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than
not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of
the investment’s amortized cost basis. During 2011, 2010 and
2009, the Company did not recognize any significant impairment
charges. As of September 24, 2011, the Company does not
consider any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily
impaired.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company
uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to
foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign
exchange risk on expected future cash flows on certain forecasted
revenue and cost of sales, on net investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and
liabilities.

To help protect
gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the U. S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign
currency revenue. The Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U. S. dollar and who sell in local currencies
may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not
denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The
Company typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign
currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases
generally up to six months.

To help protect
the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the
carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company may
also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses
generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities
denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting
considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from
movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company
records all derivatives on the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value. The Company’s accounting policies for these
instruments are based on whether the instruments are designated as
hedge or non-hedge instruments. The effective portions of cash flow
hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in
earnings. The effective portions of net investment hedges are
recorded in other comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative
translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash flow
hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income and
expense. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments
are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the financial
statement line item the derivative relates to.

The Company had
a net deferred gain associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $290 million and a net deferred loss associated with
cash flow hedges of approximately $252 million, net of taxes,
recorded in AOCI as of September 24, 2011 and
September 25, 2010, respectively. Deferred gains and losses
associated with cash flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are
recognized as a component of net sales in the same period as the
related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses
related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized
as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related
costs are recognized. Substantially all of the Company’s
hedged transactions as of September 24, 2011 are expected to
occur within six months.

Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will
not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI
associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified
immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes
in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other
income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net
gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during 2011, 2010 and
2009.

The
Company’s unrealized net gains and losses on net investment
hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account
of AOCI, were not significant as of September 24, 2011 and
September 25, 2010, respectively. The ineffective portions and
amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment
hedges are recorded in other income and expense.

The Company
recognized in other income and expense a net loss of $158 million,
$123 million and $133 million on foreign currency forward and
option contracts not designated as hedging instruments during 2011,
2010 and 2009, respectively. These amounts represent the net gain
or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include changes in
the related exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain
or loss on the derivative contracts.

The following
table summarizes the notional principal amounts of the
Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk
amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative
instruments as of September 24, 2011 and September 25,
2010 (in millions):

                                 2011

$              10,727      $            

The notional
principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide
one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not
represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or
market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s
gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative
instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on
then-current currency exchange rates at each respective date. The
Company’s gross exposure on these transactions may be further
mitigated by collateral received from certain counterparties. The
Company’s exposure to credit loss and market risk will vary
over time as a function of currency exchange rates. Although the
table above reflects the notional principal and credit risk amounts
of the Company’s foreign exchange instruments, it does not
reflect the gains or losses associated with the exposures and
transactions that the foreign exchange instruments are intended to
hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these
financial instruments, together with the gains and losses on the
underlying exposures, will depend on actual market conditions
during the remaining life of the instruments.

The Company
generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce
credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the
same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company
generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide
for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of
certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually
established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets
and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values. As of
September 24, 2011, the Company received cash collateral
related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security
arrangements of $288 million, which it recorded as accrued expenses
in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  As of September 25,
2010, the Company posted cash collateral related to the derivative
instruments under its collateral security arrangements of $445
million, which it recorded as other current assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company did not have any derivative
instruments with credit-risk related contingent features that would
require it to post additional collateral as of September 24,
2011 or September 25, 2010.

Accounts
Receivable

Trade
Receivables

The Company has
considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added
resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,
enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not
require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will
require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In
addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk
on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or
by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support
credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly
between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As
such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit
risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

As of
September 24, 2011, there were no customers that accounted for
10% or more of the Company’s total trade receivables. Trade
receivables from two of the Company’s customers accounted for
15% and 12% of total trade receivables as of September 25,
2010. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for
52% and 64% of trade receivables as of September 24, 2011 and
September 25, 2010, respectively. The additions and write-offs
to the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts during 2011,
2010 and 2009 were not significant.

Vendor Non-Trade
Receivables

The Company has
non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors
resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products
for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly
from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the
Company’s vendors accounted for 53% and 29% of total
non-trade receivables as of September 24, 2011 and vendor
non-trade receivables from two of the Company’s vendors
accounted for 57% and 24% of total non-trade receivables as of
September 25, 2010. The Company does not reflect the sale of
these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at
which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of
sales.
