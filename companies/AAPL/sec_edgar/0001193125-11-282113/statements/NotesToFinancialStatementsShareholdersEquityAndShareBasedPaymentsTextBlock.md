Shareholders’ Equity and Share-based
Compensation

Preferred
Stock

The Company has
five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is
issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company’s
Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is
authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the Company’s authorized but
unissued shares of preferred stock.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an
element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net
income. The Company’s other comprehensive income consists of
foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries
not using the U. S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities classified as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain
derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow
hedges.

The following
table summarizes the components of AOCI, net of taxes, as of
September 24, 2011, September 25, 2010, and

Employee Benefit
Plans

2003 Employee Stock
Plan

The 2003
Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”) is a shareholder
approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to
employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the
granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options,
RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and
performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan
generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and
generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly
vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two
to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon
vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a
one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to an award
granted under the 2003 Plan (other than a stock option or stock
appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for
grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in
respect of an option or stock appreciation right count against the
number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. As of
September 24, 2011, approximately 50.8 million shares
were reserved for future issuance under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Director Stock
Plan

The 1997
Director Stock Plan (the “ Director Plan”) is a
shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to
grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s
non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial
grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board and
automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of
shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board to prospectively
change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the
initial and annual award grants and the methodology for determining
the number of shares of the Company’s common stock subject to
these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued with
respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number
of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares. The
Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. As of
September 24, 2011, approximately 190,000 shares were reserved
for future issuance under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading
Plans

During the
fourth quarter of 2011, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter
Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Phil Schiller and Jeffrey E.
Williams, and directors William V. Campbell and Arthur D. Levinson
had trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the Securities
Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange Act”).
A trading plan is a written document that pre-establishes the
amounts, prices and dates (or a formula for determining the
amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the
Company’s stock, including the exercise and sale of employee
stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s
employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of RSUs.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “ Purchase Plan”) is a
shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month
offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s
compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of
stock during any calendar year. As of September 24, 2011,
approximately 3.1 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the Purchase Plan.

Employee Savings
Plan

The Employee
Savings Plan (the “ Savings Plan”) is a deferred salary
arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code.
Under the Savings Plan, participating U. S. employees may defer a
portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual
contribution limit ($16,500 for calendar year 2011). The Company
matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employee’s eligible earnings. The Company’s matching
contributions to the Savings Plan were $90 million, $72 million and
$59 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Restricted Stock

A summary of
the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the
three years ended September 24, 2011, is as follows (in
thousands, except per share amounts):

  Balance at              14,446        $231.49  

The fair value
as of the vesting date of RSUs was $1.5 billion, $1.0 billion and
$221 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The majority of
RSUs that vested in 2011, 2010 and 2009, were net-share settled
such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the
employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable
income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were
approximately 1.6 million, 1.8 million and 707,000 for
2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and were based on the value of
the RSUs on their vesting date as determined by the Company’s
closing stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax
obligations to the taxing authorities were $520 million, $406
million and $82 million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively, and
are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.  These net-share settlements had the
effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and
retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued
as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the
Company.

Aggregate
intrinsic value represents the value of the Company’s closing
stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess
of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of
options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of
options at time of exercise was $2.6 billion, $2.0 billion and $827
million for 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively.

Share-based
Compensation

Share-based
compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee
stock purchase plan rights (“stock purchase rights”) is
estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based
on the fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model.
The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions
including expected volatility, expected life and interest
rates.  The expected volatility is based on the historical
volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent
period commensurate with the expected life of the Company’s
stock options and other relevant factors including implied
volatility in market traded options on the Company’s common
stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its
historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock
awards it grants to employees. The Company recognizes share-based
compensation cost as expense on a straight-line basis over the
requisite service period.

The Company
granted 1,370 stock options, 34,000 stock options and 234,000 stock
options during 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. The
weighted-average grant date fair value of stock options granted
during 2011, 2010 and 2009 was $181.13, $108.58 and $46.71 per
share, respectively.

The Company did
not assume any stock options in conjunction with business
combinations during 2011 or 2009. During 2010, the Company assumed
98,000 stock options, which had a weighted-average fair value of
$216.82 per share.

The
weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was
$71.47, $45.03 and $30.62 during 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively.

The following
table provides a summary of the share-based compensation expense
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for the three
years ended September 24, 2011 (in millions):

The income tax
benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $467
million, $314 million and $266 million for 2011, 2010 and 2009,
respectively. As of September 24, 2011, the total unrecognized
compensation cost related to outstanding stock options and RSUs was
$2.6 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a
weighted-average period of 3.7 years.
