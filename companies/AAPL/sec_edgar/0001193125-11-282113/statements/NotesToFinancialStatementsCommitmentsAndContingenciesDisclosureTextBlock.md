Commitments and Contingencies

Accrued Warranty and
Indemnification

The Company
offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware
products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is
typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts
used to repair the Company’s hardware products. The Company
provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred
under its basic limited product warranties at the time related
revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the
size of the installed base of products subject to warranty
protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical
experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future estimates.

The following
table reconciles changes in the Company’s accrued warranty
and related costs for the three years ended September 24, 2011
(in millions):

The Company
generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other
agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject
to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the
Company has not been required to make any significant payments
resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an
indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management, there was
not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred
a material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its
operating system or application software for infringement of
third-party intellectual property rights. The Company did not
record a liability for infringement costs related to
indemnification as of either September 24, 2011 or
September 25, 2010.

The Company has
entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and
executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed
to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by
law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as
directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not
possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the
Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the
Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance
coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments
made under these agreements historically have not been
material.

Concentrations in the
Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most
components essential to the Company’s business are generally
available from multiple sources, a number of components are
currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects
the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many
components that are available from multiple sources are at times
subject to industry-wide shortages and significant commodity
pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has entered into
various agreements for the supply of components; however there can
be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or renew
these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the
Company remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages
and price increases that can materially adversely affect its
financial condition and operating results.

The Company and
other participants in the mobile communication and media device,
and personal computer industries also compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased
demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom
components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and
new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom
components available from only one source. When a component or
product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may
exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or
manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply
of components for a new or existing product were delayed or
constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of
completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely
affected. The Company’s business and financial performance
could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time
required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source,
or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative
source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable
prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated
on the production of common components instead of components
customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

Substantially
all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are primarily located in Asia. A
significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently
performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in
single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the
sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturer for many of
the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely
with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the
Company’s operating results could be adversely affected if
its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production
commitments. The Company’s purchase commitments typically
cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.

Long-Term Supply
Agreements

The Company has
entered into long-term agreements to secure the supply of certain
inventory components. These agreements generally expire between
2012 and 2022. As of September 24, 2011, the Company had a
total of $2.3 billion of inventory component prepayments
outstanding, of which $728 million are classified as other current
assets and $1.6 billion are classified as other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company had a total of $956
million of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of
September 25, 2010. The Company’s outstanding
prepayments will be applied to certain inventory component
purchases made during the term of each respective
agreement.

Other Off-Balance Sheet
Commitments

Lease
Commitments

The Company
leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space,
under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does
not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not
exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms
not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are
for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are
for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of
September 24, 2011, the Company’s total future minimum
lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $3.0
billion, of which $2.4 billion related to leases for retail
space.

Rent expense
under all operating leases, including both cancelable and
noncancelable leases, was $338 million, $271 million and $231
million in 2011, 2010 and 2009, respectively. Future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining
terms in excess of one year as of September 24, 2011, are as
follows (in millions):

  Years                           
  2012                       338  
  2013                       365  
  2014                       362  
  2015                       345  
  2016                       320  
  Thereafter               1,302  
  Total minimum lease      3,032  

Other
Commitments

As of
September 24, 2011, the Company had outstanding off-balance
sheet commitments for outsourced manufacturing and component
purchases of $13.9 billion.

Additionally,
other outstanding obligations were $2.4 billion as of
September 24, 2011, and were comprised mainly of commitments
under long-term supply agreements to make additional inventory
component prepayments and to acquire capital equipment, commitments
to acquire product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, and
commitments related to advertising, research and development,
Internet and telecommunications services and other
obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is
subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this
Form 10-K under the heading “ Legal Proceedings” and in
Part I Item 1A under the heading “ Risk Factors.”
In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable
possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a
material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently
uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood
of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal
matters were resolved against the Company in the same reporting
period for amounts in excess of management’s expectations,
the Company’s consolidated financial statements of a
particular reporting period could be materially adversely
affected.
