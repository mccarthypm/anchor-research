  (1)      “ Number of Shares” represents those shares delivered in           
           advance of settlement and does not represent the final number of   
           shares to be delivered under the ASRs. The total number of shares  
           ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price   
           paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable    
           purchase period based on the volume weighted-average price of the  
           Company’s common stock during that period. The August 2014         
           ASR and January 2014 ASR purchase periods will end in or before    
           February 2015 and December 2014, respectively.
