Accrued Warranty and Indemnification

The Company offers a basic limited parts and labor
warranty on its hardware products. The basic warranty period for
hardware products is typically one year from the date of purchase
by the end-user. The Company also offers a90-daybasic warranty for its service
parts used to repair the Company’s hardware products. The
Company provides currently for the estimated cost that may be
incurred under its basic limited product warranties at the time
related revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the
size of the installed base of products subject to warranty
protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical
experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future estimates.

The following table shows changes in the
Company’s accrued warranties and related costs for 2014, 2013
and 2012 (in millions):

The Company generally does not indemnify end-users
of its operating system and application software against legal
claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual
property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company
sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the
Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified
third-party. However, the Company has not been required to make any
significant payments resulting from such an infringement claim
asserted against it or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion
of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the
Company may have incurred a material loss with respect to
indemnification of end-users of its operating system or application
software for infringement of third-party intellectual property
rights. The Company did not record a liability for infringement
costs related to indemnification as of September 27, 2014 or
September 28, 2013.

The Company has entered into indemnification
agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these
agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to
the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise
by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance
expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related
legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum
potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make
under these agreements due to the limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors
and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to
such obligations, and payments made under these agreements
historically have not been material.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials
and Product

Although most components essential to the
Company’s business are generally available from multiple
sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single
or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various
components with other participants in the markets for mobile
communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore,
many components used by the Company, including those that are
available from multiple sources, are at times subject to
industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that
could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial
condition and operating results.

The Company uses some custom components that are
not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced
by the Company often utilize custom components available from only
one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,
initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’
yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product
were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s
financial condition and operating results could be materially
adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial
performance could also be materially adversely affected depending
on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the
original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities
from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if
those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components
instead of components customized to meet the Company’s
requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the
supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that
the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on
similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to
significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that
could materially adversely affect its financial condition and
operating results.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware
products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located
primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this
manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of
outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these
outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components
and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products.
Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on
manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results
could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable
to meet their production commitments. The Company’s purchase
commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150
days.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases various equipment and
facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating
lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any
other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility
leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally
contain multi-year renewal options. Leases for retail space are for
terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are for
10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of
September 27, 2014, the Company’s total future minimum
lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $5.0
billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for retail
space.

Rent expense under all operating leases, including
both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $717 million, $645
million and $488 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
having remaining terms in excess of one year as of
September 27, 2014, are as follows (in millions):

        2015        662  
        2016        676  
        2017        645  
        2018        593  
        2019        534  
  Thereafter      1,877  
       Total      4,987  

Other Commitments

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners
to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and
to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These
outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on
demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers
periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual
components for its products from a wide variety of individual
suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts and open orders based on projected demand information.
Where appropriate, the purchases are applied
to inventory component prepayments that
are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of
September 27, 2014, the Company had outstanding off-balance
sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
commitments of $24.5 billion.

In addition to the off-balance sheet commitments
mentioned above, the Company had outstanding obligations of $3.4
billion as of September 27, 2014, which consisted mainly of
commitments to acquire capital assets, including product tooling
and manufacturing process equipment, and commitments related to
advertising, R& D, Internet and telecommunications services and
other obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings
and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
that have not been fully adjudicated. In the opinion of management,
there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may
have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in excess of a
recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies. However, the
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although
management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be
remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against
the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.

Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.

On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict
awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division.
On March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in
favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930
million.  Because the award is now subject to appeal, the
Company has not recognized the award in its results of
operations.

VirnetX, Inc. v. Apple Inc. et al.

On August 11, 2010, VirnetX, Inc. filed an
action against the Company alleging that certain of its products
infringed on four patents relating to network communications
technology. On November 6, 2012, a jury returned a verdict
against the Company, and awarded damages of $368 million. On
September 16, 2014, the Court of Appeals for the Federal
Circuit affirmed the District Court’s decision in part,
reversed in part, and vacated the damages award. The case has been
remanded for further proceedings.
