The Company paid cash dividends of $0.38 per share,

Share Repurchase Program

In 2012, the Company’s Board of Directors
authorized a program to repurchase up to $10 billion of the
Company’s common stock beginning in 2013. The Company’s
Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to
$60 billion in April 2013 and to $90 billion in April 2014. As of
September 27, 2014, $67.9 billion of the $90 billion had been
utilized. The Company’s share repurchase program does not
obligate it to acquire any specific number of shares. Under the
program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or
open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule
10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“ Exchange Act”).

The Company has entered into four accelerated share
repurchase arrangements (“ ASRs”) with financial
institutions beginning in August 2012. In exchange for up-front
payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the
Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each
ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore
the average repurchase price paid per share, will be determined at
the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the
volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock
during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods
they are delivered, and theup-frontpayments are accounted for as
a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet in the periods the payments are made.
The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in
the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share
and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs
met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and
therefore, were not accounted for as derivative instruments.

The following table presents the Company’s
ASRs:

  (1)      “ Number of Shares” represents those shares delivered in           
           advance of settlement and does not represent the final number of   
           shares to be delivered under the ASRs. The total number of shares  
           ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price   
           paid per share, will be determined at the end of the applicable    
           purchase period based on the volume weighted-average price of the  
           Company’s common stock during that period. The August 2014         
           ASR and January 2014 ASR purchase periods will end in or before    
           February 2015 and December 2014, respectively.
