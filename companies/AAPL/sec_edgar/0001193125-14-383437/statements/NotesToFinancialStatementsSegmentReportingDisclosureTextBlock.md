| **      Segment Information and Geographic Data** | Note 11 - Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company reports segment information based on
the “management” approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the
Company’s reportable segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a
geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments
consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia
Pacific and Retail operations. The Americas segment includes both
North and South America. The Europe segment includes European
countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The
Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The
Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian
countries, other than those countries included in the
Company’s other operating segments. The results of the
Company’s geographic segments do not include results of the
Retail segment. Each operating segment provides similar hardware
and software products and similar services. The accounting policies
of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1,
“ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its
operating segments based on net sales and operating income. Net
sales for geographic segments are generally based on the location
of customers, while Retail segment net sales are based on sales
through the Company’s retail stores. Operating income for
each segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of
sales and operating expenses directly attributable to the segment.
Advertising expenses are generally included in the geographic
segment in which the expenditures are incurred. Operating income
for each segment excludes other income and expense and certain
expenses managed outside the operating segments. Costs excluded
from segment operating income include various corporate expenses
such as R& D, corporate marketing expenses, share-based
compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges,
other separately managed general and administrative costs and
certain manufacturing period expenses. The Company does not include
intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes.

Segment assets include receivables and inventories,
and for the Retail segment also includes capital assets. Segment
assets exclude corporate assets, such as cash and cash equivalents,
short-term and long-term marketable securities, vendor non-trade
receivables, other long-term investments, manufacturing and
corporate facilities, product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, miscellaneous corporate infrastructure, goodwill and
other acquired intangible assets. Except for the Retail segment,
capital asset purchases for long-lived assets are not reported to
management by segment and therefore are excluded from the
geographic segment assets and instead included in corporate assets.
Cash payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment
were $484 million, $495 million and $858 million for 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively. The Company’s total depreciation and
amortization was $7.9 billion, $6.8 billion and $3.3 billion in
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, of which $441 million, $382
million and $319 million was related to the Retail segment in the
respective years. Depreciation and amortization on segment assets
included in the geographic segments was not significant.

As the Company continues to expand its business,
management believes collaboration across its online, Retail and
indirect channels is integral to better serve its customers and
optimize its financial results. Beginning in the first quarter of
2015, management will be assessing business performance and making
decisions on a geographic basis, including the results of its
retail stores in each respective geographic segment. Accordingly,
the Company will be changing its reportable segments to align with
the way the business is managed. The Company’s reportable
operating segments will consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater
China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific operations, and the Retail
segment will no longer be classified as a separate reportable
segment. The historical segment data for prior periods will be
reclassified to reflect this change beginning in the Quarterly
Report on Form 10-Q for the quarter ending December 27,
2014.
