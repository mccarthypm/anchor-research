Stock Plans

2014 Employee Stock Plan

In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders
approved the 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”)
and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new awards
under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”).
The 2014 Plan provides for broad-based equity grants to employees,
including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs,
stock grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock
appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus awards. RSUs granted
under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based on
continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the
Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. Each share
issued with respect to RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by two shares.
RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding
obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under
the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs
cancelled or shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the
2014 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“ DERs”),
which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per share
as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting
and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs.
DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon
approval of the 2014 Plan, the Company reserved 385 million
shares plus the number of shares remaining that were reserved but
not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to outstanding
awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise
terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations
with respect to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the
2014 Plan. As of September 27, 2014, approximately
492.6 million shares were reserved for future issuance under
the 2014 Plan.

2003 Employee Stock Plan

The 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that
provided for broad-based equity grants to employees, including
executive officers. The 2003 Plan permitted the granting of
incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, RSUs, stock
appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based
awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expire seven
to ten years after the grant date and generally become exercisable
over a period of four years, based on continued employment, with
either annual, semi-annual or quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under
the 2003 Plan generally vest over two to four years, based on
continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of the
Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs,
other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under
the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and
other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs
are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In the
second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to
grant new awards under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Director Stock Plan

The 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “ Director
Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan that (i) permits
the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the
Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for
automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director
joining the Board of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs
at each annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the
Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of
stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and
the methodology for determining the number of shares of the
Company’s common stock subject to these grants without
shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs
granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares
available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan
expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director
Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and
other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs
are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. As of
September 27, 2014, approximately 1.2 million shares were
reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the fourth quarter of 2014, Section 16
officers Timothy D. Cook, Luca Maestri, Daniel Riccio, Philip W.
Schiller, D. Bruce Sewell and Jeffrey E. Williams had equity
trading plans in place in accordance withRule 10b5-1(c)(1)under the
Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that
pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or
sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired
pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity
plans.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the
“ Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder approved plan under
which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s
common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of
the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the
beginning or the end of six-month offering periods. An
employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are
limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees
may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar
year. As of September 27, 2014, approximately 7.6 million
shares were reserved for future issuance under the Purchase
Plan.

401(k) Plan

The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred
salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the Internal
Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U. S. employees
may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual
contribution limit ($17,500 for calendar year 2014). The Company
matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employee’s eligible earnings. The Company’s matching
contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $163 million, $135 million
and $114 million in 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

Restricted Stock Units

A summary of the Company’s RSU activity and
related information for 2014, 2013 and 2012, is as follows:

                                                  Weighted-Average  
                                                        Grant Date

  Balance at September 24, 2011      101,122                $33.07  
  RSUs granted                        54,597                $61.62  
  RSUs vested                        (44,137                $29.32  
  RSUs cancelled                      (6,545                $36.57

  RSUs cancelled                      (8,877                $57.31  
  Balance at September 28, 2013       93,284                $62.24  
  RSUs granted                        59,269                $74.54  
  RSUs vested                        (43,111                $57.29  
  RSUs cancelled                      (5,620                $68.47  
  Balance at September 27, 2014      103,822                $70.98  

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates
of RSUs was $3.4 billion, $3.1 billion and $3.3 billion for 2014,
2013 and 2012, respectively. The majority of RSUs that vested in
2014, 2013 and 2012 were net-share settled such that the Company
withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’
minimum statutory obligation for the applicable income and other
employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the appropriate taxing
authorities. The total shares withheld were approximately
15.6 million, 15.5 million and 16.1 million for
2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were based on the value of
the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as determined by the
Company’s closing stock price. Total payments for the
employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were
$1.2 billion, $1.1 billion and $1.2 billion in 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively, and are reflected as a financing activity
within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.  These
net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the
Company as they reduced and retired the number of shares that would
have otherwise been issued as a result of the vesting and did not
represent an expense to the Company.

Stock Options

The Company had 6.6 million stock options
outstanding as of September 27, 2014, with a weighted-average
exercise price per share of $21.99 and weighted-average remaining
contractual term of 1.4 years, substantially all of which are
exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value of the stock options
outstanding as of September 27, 2014 was $520 million, which
represents the value of the Company’s closing stock price on
the last trading day of the period in excess of the
weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of options
outstanding. Total intrinsic value of options at time of exercise
was $1.5 billion, $1.0 billion and $2.3 billion for 2014, 2013 and
2012, respectively.

share-based compensation expense included in the Consolidated
Statements of Operations for 2014, 2013 and 2012 (in millions):

The income tax benefit related to share-based
compensation expense was $1.0 billion, $816 million and
$567 million for 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively. As of
September 27, 2014, the total unrecognized compensation cost
related to outstanding stock options, RSUs and restricted stock was
$6.3 billion, which the Company expects to recognize over a
weighted-average period of 2.9 years.
