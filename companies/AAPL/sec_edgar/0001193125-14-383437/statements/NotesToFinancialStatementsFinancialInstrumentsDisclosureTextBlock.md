The Company may sell certain of its marketable
securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons
including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration
and duration management. The net realized gains or losses
recognized by the Company, related to such sales, were not
significant during 2014, 2013 and 2012. The maturities of the
Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range
from one to five years.

As of September 27, 2014 and
September 28, 2013, gross unrealized losses related to
individual securities that had been in a continuous loss position
for 12 months or longer were not significant.

As of September 27, 2014, the Company
considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities
investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not
consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired.
The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its
investment policy limits the amount of credit exposure to any one
issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be investment
grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential risk
of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual
security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment
for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors
such as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been
below its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any
changes thereto, changes in market interest rates, and the
Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than
not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of
the investment’s cost basis. During 2014, 2013 and 2012 the
Company did not recognize any significant impairment charges.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company uses derivatives to partially offset
its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk.
The Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts,
swaps, or other derivative instruments to offset some of the risk
on expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain
foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and
liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain
exposures for a variety of reasons including, but not limited to,
accounting considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of
hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges
will offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting
from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U. S. dollar hedge a
portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company’s
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar and
who sell in local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted
inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’
functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and
inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To help protect the net investment in a foreign
operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option
contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these
investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange
rates.

The Company may also enter into foreign currency
forward contracts and option contracts to partially offset the
foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the
re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in
non-functional currencies.

The Company may enter into interest rate swaps,
options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These
instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,
or changes in fair value of the Company’s long-term debt or
investments.

The Company records all derivatives in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s
accounting treatment for these instruments is based on the hedge
designation. The effective portions of cash flow hedges are
recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are
recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain
related to the change in value of the underlying hedged item. The
effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income (“ OCI”) as a part of the
cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions of cash
flow hedges and net investment hedges are recorded in other income
and expense. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging
instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the
financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.

Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow
hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of
net sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized,
and deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of
inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales
in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred
gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest
income or expense are recognized as a component of other
income/(expense), net in the same period as the related income or
expense is recognized. The Company’s foreign currency and
interest rate transactions hedged with cash flow hedges as of
September 27, 2014 are expected to occur within 12 months and
four years, respectively.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the
forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially
identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such
derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other
income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such
derivative instruments are reflected in other income and expense
unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The
Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses
related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow
hedges during 2014, 2013 and 2012.

The gain/loss recognized in other income and
expense for foreign currency forward and option contracts not
designated as hedging instruments was not significant during 2014,
2013 and 2012. These amounts represent the net gain or loss on the
derivative contracts and do not include changes in the related
exposures, which generally offset a portion of the gain or loss on
the derivative contracts.

The following table shows the notional amounts of
the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments and credit
risk amounts associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative
instruments as of September 27, 2014 and September 28,
2013 (in millions):

The notional amounts for outstanding derivative
instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume
outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts
represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential
accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or
unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the
terms of the contract, based onthen-currentcurrency or interest
rates at each respective date. The Company’s gross exposure
on these transactions may be further mitigated by collateral
received from certain counterparties. The Company’s exposure
to credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and
interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the
notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative
instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated
with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are
intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement
of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses
on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.

The Company generally enters into master netting
arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by
permitting net settlement of transactions with the same
counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for
collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of
certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually
established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets
and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As of September 27, 2014, the
Company received $2.1 billion of cash collateral related to the
derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements,
which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.  As of September 28, 2013, the Company posted cash
collateral related to the derivative instruments under its
collateral security arrangements of $164 million, which were
recorded as other current assets in the Consolidated Balance
Sheet.  The Company did not have any derivative instruments
with credit-risk related contingent features that would require it
to post additional collateral as of September 27, 2014 or
September 28, 2013.

Under master netting arrangements with the
respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative
contracts, the  Company is allowed to net settle transactions
with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of
September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013, the potential
effects of these rights of set-off associated with the
Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of
collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and
derivative liabilities of $1.6 billion and $333 million,
respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities of
$549 million and $57 million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables
outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,
wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized
businesses, and education, enterprise and government customers. The
Company generally does not require collateral from its customers;
however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances
to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company
attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit
insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party
financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party
financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company
generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing
related to any of these arrangements.

As of September 27, 2014, the Company had two
customers that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,
one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. As of
September 28, 2013, the Company had two customers that
represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which
accounted for 13% and the other 10%. The Company’s cellular
network carriers accounted for 72% and 68% of trade receivables as
of September 27, 2014 and September 28, 2013,
respectively. The additions and write-offs to the Company’s
allowance for doubtful accounts during 2014, 2013 and 2012 were not
significant.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain
of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components
to these manufacturing vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or
assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases
these components directly from suppliers. Three of the
Company’s vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14% of total
vendor non-trade receivables as of September 27, 2014 and
three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 47%, 21% and 15%
of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 28,
2013. The Company does not reflect the sale of these components in
net sales and does not recognize any profits on these sales until
the related products are sold by the Company, at which time any
profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of sales.
