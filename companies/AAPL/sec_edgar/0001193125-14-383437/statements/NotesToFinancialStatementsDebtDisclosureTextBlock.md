Commercial Paper

In April 2014, the Board of Directors authorized
the Company to issue unsecured short-term promissory notes

dividends and share repurchases. As of September 27, 2014, the
Company had $6.3 billion of Commercial Paper outstanding, with a
weighted-average interest rate of 0.12% and maturities generally
less than nine months.

respectively. The debt issuances included floating- and fixed-rate
notes with varying maturities for an aggregate principal amount of
$29.0 billion (collectively the “ Notes”). The Notes are
senior unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears,

The Company has entered, and may enter in the
future, into interest rate swaps to manage interest rate risk on
the Notes. Such swaps allow the Company to effectively convert
fixed-rate payments into floating-rate payments or floating-rate
payments into fixed-rate payments. In the third quarter of 2014,
the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate
notional amount of $9.0 billion, which effectively converted the
fixed-rate notes due 2017, 2019, 2021 and 2024 into floating-rate
notes. In the third quarter of 2013, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $3.0
billion, which effectively converted the floating-rate notes due
2016 and 2018 into fixed-rate notes.

The effective rates for the Notes include the
interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if
applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized
$381 million and $136 million of interest expense on its long-term
debt for the years ended September 27, 2014 and
September 28, 2013, respectively. The Company did not have any
long-term debt in 2012.

Future principal payments for the Company’s
Notes as of September 27, 2014, are as follows (in
millions):

        2015           0  
        2016       2,500  
        2017       2,500

        2019       3,000  
  Thereafter      15,000  
       Total      29,000  

As of September 27, 2014 and
September 28, 2013, the fair value of the Company’s
Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $28.5 billion and $15.9
billion, respectively.
