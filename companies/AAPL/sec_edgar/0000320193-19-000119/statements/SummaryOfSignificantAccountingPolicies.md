Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple
Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). 
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of 
the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all 
adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair 
financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U. S. generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ 
materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified 
to conform to the current period’s presentation.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last 
Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks
each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in 
the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign
the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, 
references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the 
Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months 
and periods of those fiscal years.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)(“ASU 2014-09”), and additional
ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new 
revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue 
recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full 
retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in 
the prior periods presented, as the adoption of the new revenue standard did not
have a material impact on previously reported amounts.

Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the
amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which
are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, 
in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of 
these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting 
framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were 
reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.

Financial Instruments

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, 
Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement 
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities(“ASU 2016-01”), which updates 
certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of 
financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material 
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income 
Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory(“ASU 
2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an 
intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer 
occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective 
transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded$2.7 billion of net 
deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by$128 million, and 
increased retained earnings by$2.6 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net 
deferred tax assets are utilized.

Restricted Cash

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, 
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash(“ASU 2016-18”), which 
enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of 
restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires additional 
disclosures about restricted cash balances.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense
on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately 
vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”

Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per 
share for2019,2018 and2017(net income in millions and shares in thousands):

11.91      $              9.21  

The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect 
of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities 
representing15.5 million shares of common stock were excluded from the 
computation of diluted earnings per share for2019 because their effect would 
have been antidilutive.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt 
securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s 
underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).

The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based 
on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current 
operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair 
value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI& E”).

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.

Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the 
lesser of30 years or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one 
and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and 
manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life 
for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software 
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets, which range from three to five years. Depreciation and amortization 
expense on property and equipment was$11.3 billion,$9.3 billion and$8.2 billion 
during2019,2018 and2017, respectively.

Non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted 
in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities 
of$(2.9) billion and$3.4 billion during2019 and2018, respectively.

Non-Marketable Securities

The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity 
securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s 
non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and 
are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions 
for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on 
non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI& E.

Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities

The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when 
withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company records restricted 
cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current 
or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.
The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or non-current 
marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the 
classification of the underlying securities.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable 
equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s
debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have 
counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or 
model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.
