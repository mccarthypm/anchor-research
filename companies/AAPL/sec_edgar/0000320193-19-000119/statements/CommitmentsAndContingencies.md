The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers 
who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U. S., the U. K. and mainland China. The
iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for 
a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are
met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and 
recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with 
subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally 
available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from 
single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets 
and other electronic devices. Therefore, many components used by the Company, 
including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject 
to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its 
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom 
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields
have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued 
availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be 
affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common 
components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; 
however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or 
renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by 
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers
manufactured in the U. S. and Ireland.

Other Off - Balance Sheet Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, 
under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently
utilize any other off - balance sheet financing arrangements. As ofSeptember 28,
2019, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable 
operating leases were$10.8 billion. The Company’s retail store and other 
facility leases typically have original terms not exceeding10 years and 
generally contain multi-year renewal options.

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and 
noncancelable leases, was$1.3 billion,$1.2 billion and$1.1 billion in2019,2018 
and2017, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable 
operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of one year as 
ofSeptember 28, 2019, are as follows (in millions):

        2020      $         1,306  
        2021                1,276  
        2022                1,137  
        2023      912              
        2024      834              
  Thereafter                5,373  
       Total      $        10,838  

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off - balance sheet commitments that 
require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase 
obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily 
consist of payments for supplier arrangements, Internet and telecommunication 
services, intellectual property licenses and content creation. Future payments 
under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term 
in excess of one year as ofSeptember 28, 2019, are as follows (in millions):

        2020      $        2,476  
        2021               2,386  
        2022               1,859  
        2023               1,162  
        2024      218             
  Thereafter      110             
       Total      $        8,211  

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen 
in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The 
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more legal matters were
resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts above 
management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and operating 
results for that reporting period could be materially adversely affected. In the
opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the 
Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss greater than a 
recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted legal and other 
claims, except for the following matters:

VirnetX

VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed two lawsuits in the U. S. District Court for the
Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”) against the 
Company alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the 
“VirnetX Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“VirnetX I” 
and “VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I
against the Company and awarded damages of$302 million, which later increased 
to$440 million in post-trial proceedings. The Company appealed the VirnetX I 
verdict to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “Federal 
Circuit”). On April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against 
the Company and awarded damages of$503 million. VirnetX II is currently on 
appeal. The Company has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U.
S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared 
the VirnetX Patents invalid. VirnetX appealed the invalidity decision of the PTO
to the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit consolidated the Company’s appeal of
the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s appeals from 
the PTO invalidity proceedings. On January 15, 2019, the Federal Circuit 
affirmed the VirnetX I verdict, which the Company intends to further appeal. On 
July 8, 2019, the Federal Circuit remanded one of VirnetX’s two appeals of the 
PTO’s invalidity decisions back to the PTO for further proceedings. On August 1,
2019, the Federal Circuit affirmed-in-part, vacated-in-part, and remanded back 
to the PTO portions of VirnetX’s second appeal. The Company has accrued its best
estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.

Qualcomm

On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated 
and affiliated parties (“Qualcomm”) in the U. S. District Court for the Southern
District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm from 
requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. No 
Qualcomm-related royalty payments had been remitted by the Company to its 
contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter of 2017. 
Following the Company’s lawsuit, Qualcomm filed patent infringement suits 
against the Company and its affiliates in the U. S. and various international 
jurisdictions, some of which sought to enjoin the sale of certain of the 
Company’s products in particular countries.

On April 16, 2019, the Company and Qualcomm reached a settlement agreement to 
dismiss all litigation between the two companies worldwide. The companies also 
reached a multi-year license agreement and a multi-year supply agreement. Under 
the terms of the settlement agreement, Apple made a payment to Qualcomm to, 
among other things, resolve disputes over the withheld royalty payments.

iOS Performance Management Cases

Various civil litigation matters have been filed in state and federal courts in 
the U. S. and in various international jurisdictions alleging violation of 
consumer protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action 
related to the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone 
operating systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2.
The claims seek monetary damages and other non-monetary relief. On April 5, 
2018, several U. S. federal actions were consolidated through a Multidistrict 
Litigation process into a single action in the U. S. District Court for the 
Northern District of California. In addition to civil litigation, the Company is
also responding to governmental investigations and requests for information 
relating to the performance management feature. The Company believes that its 
iPhones were not defective, that the performance management feature introduced 
with iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ 
user experience, and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or 
fail to disclose any material information. The Company has accrued its best 
estimate for the ultimate resolution of these matters.

French Competition Authority

In June 2019, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) issued a report alleging 
that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in France violate
French competition law. The Company vigorously disagrees with the allegations, 
and a hearing of arguments was held before the FCA on October 15, 2019. The 
Company is awaiting the decision of the FCA, which may include a fine.
