The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple
Inc. and its wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). 
Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of 
the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all 
adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair 
financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U. S. generally 
accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ 
materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified 
to conform to the current period’s presentation.
 |
|   Fiscal Period | The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last 
Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks
each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in 
the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign
the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, 
references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the 
Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months 
and periods of those fiscal years.

Revenue Recognition

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) No. 2014-09, 
Revenue from Contracts with Customers (Topic 606)(“ASU 2014-09”), and additional
ASUs issued to clarify the guidance in ASU 2014-09 (collectively the “new 
revenue standard”), which amends the existing accounting standards for revenue 
recognition. The Company adopted the new revenue standard utilizing the full 
retrospective transition method. The Company did not restate total net sales in 
the prior periods presented, as the adoption of the new revenue standard did not
have a material impact on previously reported amounts.

Additionally, beginning in the first quarter of 2019, the Company classified the
amortization of the deferred value of Maps, Siri and free iCloud services, which
are bundled in the sales price of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other products, 
in Services net sales. Historically, the Company classified the amortization of 
these amounts in Products net sales consistent with its management reporting 
framework. As a result, Products and Services net sales for 2018 and 2017 were 
reclassified to conform to the 2019 presentation.

Financial Instruments

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-01, 
Financial Instruments - Overall (Subtopic 825-10): Recognition and Measurement 
of Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities(“ASU 2016-01”), which updates 
certain aspects of the recognition, measurement, presentation and disclosure of 
financial instruments. The adoption of ASU 2016-01 did not have a material 
impact on the Company’s consolidated financial statements.

Income Taxes

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-16, Income 
Taxes (Topic 740): Intra-Entity Transfers of Assets Other Than Inventory(“ASU 
2016-16”), which requires the recognition of the income tax consequences of an 
intra-entity transfer of an asset, other than inventory, when the transfer 
occurs. The Company adopted ASU 2016-16 utilizing the modified retrospective 
transition method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded$2.7 billion of net 
deferred tax assets, reduced other non-current assets by$128 million, and 
increased retained earnings by$2.6 billion on its Consolidated Balance Sheet. 
The Company will recognize incremental deferred income tax expense as these net 
deferred tax assets are utilized.

Restricted Cash

In the first quarter of 2019, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 2016-18, 
Statement of Cash Flows (Topic 230): Restricted Cash(“ASU 2016-18”), which 
enhances and clarifies the guidance on the classification and presentation of 
restricted cash in the statement of cash flows and requires additional 
disclosures about restricted cash balances.
 |
| **  Advertising Costs** | Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.
 |
| **  Share-Based Compensation** | Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense
on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately 
vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”
 |
| **  Earnings Per Share** | The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. |
| **  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities** | Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt 
securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s 
underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).

The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based 
on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current 
operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair 
value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI& E”).

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.
 |
| **  Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.
 |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the 
lesser of

30 years

or the remaining life of the underlying building; between one and

five years

for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life for leasehold 
improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software are amortized 
on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which 
range from three to

five years

.
 |
| **  Non-Marketable Securities** | Non-Marketable Securities

The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity 
securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s 
non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and 
are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions 
for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on 
non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI& E.
 |
| **  Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities** | Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities

The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when 
withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company records restricted 
cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current 
or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.
The Company records restricted marketable securities as current or non-current 
marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the 
classification of the underlying securities
 |
| **  Fair Value Measurements** | Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable 
equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s
debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have 
counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or 
model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.

Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs 
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for 
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities.

| **  Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and 
other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects
to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its 
customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right
to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s
Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the 
Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are 
delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a 
short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of 
services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product 
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the 
Company’s expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises
within an arrangement that are capable of being distinct, the Company allocates 
revenue to all distinct performance obligations based on their relative 
stand-alone selling prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable
prices to determine SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are 
established that reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices
of the performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a 
stand-alone basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable 
prices considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts 
and circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where 
applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends 
in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and 
the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up tothree performance obligations regularly included
in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain other 
products. The first performance obligation, which represents the substantial 
portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software 
delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the right to
receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud, Siri and
Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a 
when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to 
the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any 
related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance 
obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.
Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized 
when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the 
product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services 
and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. 
Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including 
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to 
provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights
are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance 
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the 
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company 
has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of 
the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, 
and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the 
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue 
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple 
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products 
including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the 
product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility 
for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold 
through the App Store, Mac App Store, TV App Store and Watch App Store and 
certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital content stores,
the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it to the
customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales on a net basis by 
recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it retains.

The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers 
that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded
within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government 
authority.
 |
| **  Derivative Financial Instruments** | The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair 
value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is 
based on its hedge designation.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to 
foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and 
liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for 
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or
the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no 
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact 
resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, 
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U. S. 
dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar may hedge a 
portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ 
functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option 
contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these 
instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its 
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory 
purchases, typically for up to12 months.

To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency 
forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying 
amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, 
such as its foreign currency - denominated debt, as hedges of its net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company
designates these instruments as net investment hedges.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may
enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These 
instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or 
losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as
either cash flow or fair value hedges. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the Company’s 
hedged term debt - and marketable securities - related foreign currency 
transactions are expected to be recognized within23 years.

The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to 
offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by 
the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in 
non-functional currencies.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into 
interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset 
a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair 
value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair 
value hedges. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the Company’s hedged interest rate 
transactions are expected to be recognized within8 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in 
earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign 
currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period 
as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to 
cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of
sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and
losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are 
recognized in OI& E in the same period as the related income or expense is 
recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time 
value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective 
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
are recognized in OI& E.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as 
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in 
the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time 
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative 
instruments are reclassified into OI& E in the period of de-designation. Any 
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in
OI& E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of
the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts 
excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized 
in OI& E. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment 
hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the 
forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Accordingly,
any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in 
earnings in the current period.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in 
earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value 
of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value 
hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the 
forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amount 
excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair value hedges was a gain of$777 
million for2019, and was recognized in OI& E.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the 
derivative relates.

The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative financial instruments as
operating activities in its Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows.

| **  Income Taxes** | The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes.The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. |
| **  Segment Reporting** | The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The 
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for 
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s 
reportable segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and 
Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. 
Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific 
includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other
reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware 
and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to 
better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution 
partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The 
accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in 
Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net 
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally 
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores
located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment 
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating 
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are 
generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are 
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense 
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded 
from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as 
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based 
compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other 
separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not 
include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting 
purposes.
