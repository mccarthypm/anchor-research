The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary 
objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s 
investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and 
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were 
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio. When 
evaluating a marketable debt security for other-than-temporary impairment, the 
Company reviews factors such as the duration and extent to which the fair value 
of the security is less than its cost, the financial condition of the issuer and
any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it will more 
likely than not be required to sell, the security before recovery of its 
amortized cost basis. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the Company does not consider any
of its marketable debt securities to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Non-Marketable Securities

The Company holds non-marketable equity securities of certain privately held 
companies without readily determinable fair values. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the
Company’s non-marketable equity securities had a carrying value of$2.9 billion.

Restricted Cash

A reconciliation of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheet to cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash in the Consolidated 
Statement of Cash Flows as ofSeptember 28, 2019 is as follows (in millions):

                                                            2019              
  Cash and cash equivalents                                 $         48,844  
  Restricted cash included in other current assets          23                
  Restricted cash included in other non-current assets                 1,357  
  Cash, cash equivalents and restricted cash                $         50,224  

The Company’s restricted cash primarily consisted of cash required to be on 
deposit under a contractual agreement with a bank to support the Company’s 
iPhone Upgrade Program.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to 
foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and 
liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for 
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or
the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no 
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact 
resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, 
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U. S. 
dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar may hedge a 
portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ 
functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option 
contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these 
instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its 
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory 
purchases, typically for up to12 months.

To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency 
forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying 
amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, 
such as its foreign currency - denominated debt, as hedges of its net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company
designates these instruments as net investment hedges.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may
enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These 
instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or 
losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as
either cash flow or fair value hedges. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the Company’s 
hedged term debt - and marketable securities - related foreign currency 
transactions are expected to be recognized within23 years.

The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to 
offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by 
the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in 
non-functional currencies.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into 
interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset 
a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair 
value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair 
value hedges. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the Company’s hedged interest rate 
transactions are expected to be recognized within8 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in 
earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign 
currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period 
as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to 
cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of
sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and
losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are 
recognized in OI& E in the same period as the related income or expense is 
recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, changes in the time 
value are excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness. The ineffective 
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
are recognized in OI& E.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as 
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in 
the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time 
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative 
instruments are reclassified into OI& E in the period of de-designation. Any 
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in
OI& E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in OCI as a part of
the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts 
excluded from the effectiveness testing of net investment hedges are recognized 
in OI& E. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment 
hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the 
forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. Accordingly,
any gains or losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in 
earnings in the current period.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in 
earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value 
of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as fair value 
hedges, the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the 
forward carry component from its assessment of hedge effectiveness. The amount 
excluded from the effectiveness testing of fair value hedges was a gain of$777 
million for2019, and was recognized in OI& E.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the 
derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair 
value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is 
based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s 
derivative instruments at gross fair value as ofSeptember 28, 2019 andSeptember 
29, 2018(in millions):

The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure 
of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the 
Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent 
the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative 
instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to 
perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency 
or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss
and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. 
Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the 
Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses 
associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended
to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial 
instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, 
will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the 
instruments.

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are 
designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally 
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be 
received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments 
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its 
derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the net cash collateral 
received by the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral 
security arrangements was$1.6 billion, which was recorded as other current 
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, the net 
cash collateral posted by the Company related to derivative instruments under 
its collateral security arrangements was$1.0 billion, which was recorded as 
other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the 
Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle 
transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As 
ofSeptember 28, 2019 andSeptember 29, 2018, the potential effects of these 
rights of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including 
the effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and 
derivative liabilities of$2.7 billion and$2.1 billion, respectively, resulting 
in a net derivative liability of$407 million and a net derivative asset of$138 
million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party 
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and 
mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The 
Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the 
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain 
instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts
to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain 
customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support 
credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the 
third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company 
generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of 
these arrangements.

As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the Company had no customers that individually 
represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, the
Company had one customer that represented 10% or more of total trade 
receivables, which accounted for10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers 
accounted for51% and59% of total trade receivables as ofSeptember 28, 2019 
andSeptember 29, 2018, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors 
resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture 
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases
these components directly from suppliers. As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the Company 
had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor 
non-trade receivables, which accounted for59% and14%. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, 
the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total 
vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for62% and12%.
