U. S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the U. S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), 
which significantly changed U. S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U. S. 
statutory federal income tax rate from35% to21% effective January 1, 2018, while
also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. 
The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which 
the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities. 
The Company completed its accounting for the income tax effects of the Act 
during 2019, in accordance with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission 
Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 118.

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings 
of$44.3 billion,$48.0 billion and$44.7 billion in2019,2018 and2017, 
respectively.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by 
applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in2019; 24.5% in2018; 35% 
in2017) to income before provision for income taxes for2019,2018 and2017, is as

The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from 
employee stock plan awards. For restricted stock units (“RSUs”), the Company 
receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect 
of the underlying stock’s fair market value. Prior to 2018, the Company 
reflected net excess tax benefits from equity awards as increases to additional 
paid-in capital, which amounted to$620 million in2017.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the 
future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated 
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and 
their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply 
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As ofSeptember 28, 2019, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits 
was$15.6 billion, of which$8.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the 
Company’s effective tax rate. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, the total amount of gross
unrecognized tax benefits was$9.7 billion, of which$7.4 billion, if recognized, 
would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which 
excludes interest and penalties, for2019,2018 and2017, is as follows (in 
millions):

                                                                        2019

15,619      $          9,694      $         8,407  

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S. 
federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U. S. 
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 
through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014
remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to 
examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate 
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with 
certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a
manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to 
adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the 
Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax 
benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as$2.0 billion.

Interest and Penalties

The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within
the provision for income taxes. As ofSeptember 28, 2019 andSeptember 29, 2018, 
the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was$1.3 billion and$1.4
billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense 
in2019,2018 and2017 of$73 million,$489 million and$238 million, respectively.

European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland 
granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 
concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two 
subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision 
ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for 
the period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated 
to be€13.1 billion, plus interest of€1.2 billion. During the fourth quarter of 
2019, the Irish Minister for Finance approved the Company’s request to reduce 
the recovery amount by€190 million due to taxes paid to other countries, 
resulting in an adjusted recovery amount of€12.9 billion as of September 28, 
2019. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, eliminated the 
application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The Company believes the
State Aid Decision to be without merit and appealed to the General Court of the 
Court of Justice of the European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid 
Decision. The Company believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes
potentially due related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U.
S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As 
ofSeptember 28, 2019, the entire adjusted recovery amount plus interest was 
funded into escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the
conclusion of all appeals. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable 
Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.
