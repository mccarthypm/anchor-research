The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, 
including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases 
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain 
multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.

Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and 
variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the 
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the 
Company’s operating leases were $2.0 billion for both 2024 and 2023 and $1.9 
billion for 2022. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s
leases were $13.8 billion, $13.9 billion and $14.9 billion for 2024, 2023 and 
2022, respectively.

The Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $1.9 billion
in both 2024 and 2023 and $1.8 billion in 2022. Noncash activities involving 
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $1.0
billion, $2.1 billion and $2.8 billion for 2024, 2023 and 2022, respectively.

The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated 
financial statement line items, as of September 28, 2024 and September 30, 2023
