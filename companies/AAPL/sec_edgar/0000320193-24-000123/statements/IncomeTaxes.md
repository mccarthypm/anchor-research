European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted 
state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning 
the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the 
Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to 
calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003
through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, 
eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward. The 
recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus interest of €1.2 
billion.

From time to time, the Company requested approval from the Irish Minister for 
Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries.
As of September 28, 2024, the adjusted recovery amount of €12.7 billion plus 
interest of €1.2 billion was held in escrow and restricted from general use. The
total balance of the escrow, including net unrealized investment gains, was 
€14.2 billion or $15.8 billion as of September 28, 2024, of which $2.6 billion 
was classified as cash and cash equivalents and $13.2 billion was classified as 
current marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. Refer to the 
Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities section of Note 4, “Financial 
Instruments” for more information.

The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of 
the Court of Justice of the European Union (the “General Court”). On July 15, 
2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, 
the Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of 
Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was held on May 23, 2023. On September 10, 
2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside the 2020 judgment of the General 
Court and confirmed the Commission’s 2016 State Aid Decision. As a result, 
during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company recorded a one-time income tax 
charge of $10.2 billion, net, which represents $15.8 billion payable to Ireland 
via release of the escrow, partially offset by a U. S. foreign tax credit of 
$4.8 billion and a decrease in unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of September 28, 2024, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits 
was $22.0 billion, of which $10.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the 
Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of 
gross unrecognized tax benefits was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if 
recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which 
excludes interest and penalties, for 2024, 2023 and 2022, is as follows (in 
millions):

                                                                        2024

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S. 
federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 
2017 for the U. S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign
jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Altho ugh the timing of resolution
or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably
possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease between 
approximately $5 billion and $13 billion in the next 12 months, primarily 
related to intercompany transfer pricing and deemed repatriation tax.
