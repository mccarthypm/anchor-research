To manage foreign currency risk associated with the
euro-denominated notes issued in the first quarter of 2015 and the
British pound-denominated, Australian dollar-denominated and
euro-denominated notes issued in the fourth quarter of 2015, the
Company entered into currency swaps with an aggregate notional
amount of $3.5 billion, $1.9 billion, $1.6 billion and $2.2
billion, respectively, which effectively converted these notes to
U. S. dollar-denominated notes.

To manage interest rate risk on the U. S.
dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in the second quarter of
2015 and maturing in 2020 and 2022, the Company entered into
interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $2.5
billion. To manage interest rate risk on the U. S.
dollar-denominated fixed-rate notes issued in the third quarter of
2015 and maturing in 2017, 2020, 2022 and 2025, the Company entered
into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of $4.3
billion. These interest rate swaps effectively converted the fixed
interest rates on the U. S. dollar-denominated notes to a floating
interest rate.

As of September 26, 2015, ¥250.0 billion
of the Japanese yen-denominated notes was designated as a hedge of
the foreign currency exposure of its net investment in a foreign
operation. The foreign currency transaction gain or loss on the
Japanese yen-denominated debt designated as a hedge is recorded in
OCI as a part of the cumulative translation adjustment. As of
September 26, 2015, the carrying value of the debt designated
as a net investment hedge was $2.1 billion.

For further discussion regarding the
Company’s use of derivative instruments see the Derivative
Financial Instruments section of Note 2, “ Financial
Instruments.”

The effective interest rates for the Notes include
the interest on the Notes, amortization of the discount and, if
applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The Company recognized
$722 million, $381 million and $136 million of interest expense on
its term debt for 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.

The future principal payments for the
Company’s Notes as of September 26, 2015 are as follows
