The Company generally does not indemnify end-users
of its operating system and application software against legal
claims that the software infringes third-party intellectual
property rights. Other agreements entered into by the Company
sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the
Company could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an
infringement claim against the Company or an indemnified
third-party. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a
reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material
loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating
system or application software for infringement of third-party
intellectual property rights. The Company did not record a
liability for infringement costs related to indemnification as of
September 26, 2015 or September 27, 2014.

In September 2015, the Company introduced the
iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers who
purchase an iPhone 6s and 6s Plus in one of its U. S. physical
retail stores and activate the purchased iPhone with one of the
four national carriers. The iPhone Upgrade Program provides
customers the right to trade in that iPhone for a new iPhone,
provided certain conditions are met. One of the conditions of this
program requires the customer to finance the initial purchase price
of the iPhone with a third-party lender. Upon exercise of the
trade-in right and purchase of a new iPhone, the Company satisfies
the customer’s outstanding balance due to the third-party
lender on the original device. The Company accounts for the
trade-in right as a guarantee liability and recognizes arrangement
revenue net of the fair value of such right with subsequent changes
to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.

The Company has entered into indemnification
agreements with its directors and executive officers. Under these
agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify such individuals to
the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that arise
by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance
expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related
legal proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum
potential amount of payments the Company could be required to make
under these agreements due to the limited history of prior
indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances
involved in each claim. However, the Company maintains directors
and officers liability insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to
such obligations.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials
and Product

Although most components essential to the
Company’s business are generally available from multiple
sources, a number of components are currently obtained from single
or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various
components with other participants in the markets for mobile
communication and media devices and personal computers. Therefore,
many components used by the Company, including those that are
available from multiple sources, are at times subject to
industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that
could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial
condition and operating results.

The Company uses some custom components that are
not commonly used by its competitors, and new products introduced
by the Company often utilize custom components available from only
one source. When a component or product uses new technologies,
initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’
yields have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product
were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s
financial condition and operating results could be materially
adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial
performance could also be materially adversely affected depending
on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the
original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities
from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if
those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components
instead of components customized to meet the Company’s
requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the
supply of many components; however, there can be no guarantee that
the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on
similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to
significant risks of supply shortages and price increases that
could materially adversely affect its financial condition and
operating results.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware
products are manufactured by outsourcing partners that are located
primarily in Asia. A significant concentration of this
manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of
outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these
outsourcing partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components
and manufacturers for many of the Company’s products.
Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing partners on
manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results
could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable
to meet their production commitments. The Company’s purchase
commitments typically cover its requirements for periods up to 150
days.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases various equipment and
facilities, including retail space, under noncancelable operating
lease arrangements. The Company does not currently utilize any
other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. The major facility
leases are typically for terms not exceeding 10 years and generally
contain multi-year renewal options. As of September 26, 2015,
the Company had a total of 463 retail stores. Leases for retail
space are for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of
which are for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal
options. As of September 26, 2015, the Company’s total
future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
were $6.3 billion, of which $3.6 billion related to leases for
retail space.

Rent expense under all operating leases, including
both cancelable and noncancelable leases, was $794 million, $717
million and $645 million in 2015, 2014 and 2013, respectively.
Future minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases
having remaining terms in excess of one year as of
September 26, 2015, are as follows (in millions):

        2016        772  
        2017        774  
        2018        744  
        2019        715  
        2020        674  
  Thereafter      2,592  
       Total      6,271  

Other Commitments

The Company utilizes several outsourcing partners
to manufacture sub-assemblies for the Company’s products and
to perform final assembly and testing of finished products. These
outsourcing partners acquire components and build product based on
demand information supplied by the Company, which typically covers
periods up to 150 days. The Company also obtains individual
components for its products from a wide variety of individual
suppliers. Consistent with industry practice, the Company acquires
components through a combination of purchase orders, supplier
contracts and open orders based on projected demand information.
Where appropriate, the purchases are applied
to inventory component prepayments that
are outstanding with the respective supplier. As of
September 26, 2015, the Company had outstanding off-balance
sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
commitments of $29.5 billion.

In addition to the commitments mentioned above, the
Company had other off-balance sheet obligations of $7.3 billion as
of September 26, 2015 that consisted of commitments to acquire
capital assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, and commitments related to inventory prepayments,
advertising, licensing, R& D, internet and telecommunications
services, energy and other obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings
and claims that have arisen in the ordinary course of business and
that have not been fully adjudicated, certain of which are
discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the
heading “ Risk Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of
this Form 10-K under the heading “ Legal Proceedings.”
In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable
possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a
material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss
contingencies for asserted legal and other claims. However, the
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although
management considers the likelihood of such an outcome to be
remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved against
the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of
management’s expectations, the Company’s consolidated
financial statements for that reporting period could be materially
adversely affected.

Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.

On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict
awarding the Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States
District Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division.
On March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment in
favor of the Company in the amount of approximately $930
million.  On May 18, 2015, the U. S. Court of Appeals for
the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and reversed in part, the
decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of Appeals
ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of
approximately $548 million, with the District Court to determine
supplemental damages and interest, as well as damages owed for
products subject to the reversal in part. Because the ruling
remains subject to further proceedings, the Company has not
recognized the award in its results of operations.
