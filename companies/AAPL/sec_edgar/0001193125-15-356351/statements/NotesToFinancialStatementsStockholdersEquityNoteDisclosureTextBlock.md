Share Repurchase Program

In the third quarter of 2015, the Company’s
Board of Directors increased the share repurchase authorization to
$140 billion of the Company’s common stock, of which $104
billion had been utilized as of September 26, 2015. The
Company’s share repurchase program does not obligate it to
acquire any specific number of shares. Under the program, shares
may be repurchased in privately negotiated and/or open market
transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1
under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the
“ Exchange Act”).

The Company has entered, and in the future may
enter, into accelerated share repurchase arrangements
(“ ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for
up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the
Company’s common stock during the purchase periods of each
ASR. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and therefore
the average repurchase price paid per share, is determined at the
end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on the
volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock
during that period. The shares received are retired in the periods
they are delivered, and the up-front payments are accounted for as
a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are made.
The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in
the period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share
and as forward contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs
met all of the applicable criteria for equity classification, and
therefore were not accounted for as derivative instruments.

The following table shows the Company’s ASR
activity and related information during the years ended
September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014:
