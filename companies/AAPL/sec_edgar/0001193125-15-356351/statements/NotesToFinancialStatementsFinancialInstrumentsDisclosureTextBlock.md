The Company may sell certain of its marketable
securities prior to their stated maturities for strategic reasons
including, but not limited to, anticipation of credit deterioration
and duration management. The maturities of the Company’s
long-term marketable securities generally range from one to five
years.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company
considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities
investment portfolio to be temporary in nature and does not
consider any of its investments other-than-temporarily impaired.
The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities, and its
investment policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments to be
investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the
potential risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for
each individual security in the investment portfolio. When
evaluating an investment for other-than-temporary impairment the
Company reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to
which fair value has been below its cost basis, the financial
condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market
interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether
it is more likely than not it will be required to sell the
investment before recovery of the investment’s cost
basis.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset
its business exposure to foreign currency and interest rate risk on
expected future cash flows, on net investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and liabilities.
However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting
considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from
movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates, certain of the Company’s
subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U. S. dollar may hedge
a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and subsidiaries
whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar and who sell in
local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory
purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional
currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option
contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may
designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company
typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency
exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically
for up to 12 months.

To help protect the net investment in a foreign
operation from adverse changes in foreign currency exchange rates,
the Company may enter into foreign currency forward and option
contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of these
investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial
instruments, such as its foreign currency-denominated debt, as
economic hedges of its net investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates these
instruments as net investment hedges.

The Company may also enter into non-designated
foreign currency contracts to partially offset the foreign currency
exchange gains and losses generated by the re-measurement of
certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional
currencies.

The Company may enter into interest rate swaps,
options, or other instruments to manage interest rate risk. These
instruments may offset a portion of changes in income or expense,
or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or
investments. The Company designates these instruments as either
cash flow or fair value hedges. The Company’s hedged interest
rate transactions as of September 26, 2015 are expected to be
recognized within 10 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges are
recorded in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in earnings.
Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of
foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales
in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and
deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory
purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the
same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and
losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or
expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same
period as the related income or expense is recognized. The
ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness
testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other
income/(expense), net.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow
hedges must be de-designated as hedges when it is probable the
forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in the initially
identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such
derivative instruments are reclassified immediately into other
income/(expense), net. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such
derivative instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net
unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment hedges are
recorded in other comprehensive income (“ OCI”) as a
part of the cumulative translation adjustment. The ineffective
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of net
investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense),
net.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses related to changes in fair value
hedges are recognized in earnings along with a corresponding loss
or gain related to the change in value of the underlying hedged
item.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging
instruments are adjusted to fair value through earnings in the
financial statement line item to which the derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The Company’s
accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is based on
its hedge designation. The following tables show the
Company’s derivative instruments at gross fair value as of
September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014 (in
millions):

The notional amounts for outstanding derivative
instruments provide one measure of the transaction volume
outstanding and do not represent the amount of the Company’s
exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts
represent the Company’s gross exposure to potential
accounting loss on derivative instruments that are outstanding or
unsettled if all counterparties failed to perform according to the
terms of the contract, based onthen-currentcurrency or interest
rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to
credit loss and market risk will vary over time as currency and
interest rates change. Although the table above reflects the
notional and credit risk amounts of the Company’s derivative
instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses associated
with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are
intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement
of these financial instruments, together with the gains and losses
on the underlying exposures, will depend on actual market
conditions during the remaining life of the instruments.

The Company generally enters into master netting
arrangements, which are designed to reduce credit risk by
permitting net settlement of transactions with the same
counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for
collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of
certain financial instruments fluctuates from contractually
established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets
and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by
the Company related to derivative instruments under its collateral
security arrangements was $1.0 billion as of September 26,
2015 and $2.1 billion as of September 27, 2014.

Under master netting arrangements with the
respective counterparties to the Company’s derivative
contracts, the  Company is allowed to net settle transactions
with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As of
September 26, 2015 and September 27, 2014, the potential
effects of these rights of set-off associated with the
Company’s derivative contracts, including the effects of
collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and
derivative liabilities of $2.2 billion and $1.6 billion,
respectively, resulting in net derivative liabilities
of $78 million and $549 million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables
outstanding with its third-party cellular network carriers,
wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small and mid-sized
businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The
Company generally does not require collateral from its customers;
however, the Company will require collateral in certain instances
to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company
attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit
insurance for certain customers or by requiring third-party
financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party
financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company
generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing
related to any of these arrangements.

As of September 26, 2015, the Company had one
customer that represented 10% or more of total trade receivables,
which accounted for 12%. As of September 27, 2014, the Company
had two customers that represented 10% or more of total trade
receivables, one of which accounted for 16% and the other 13%. The
Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 71% and 72%
of trade receivables as of September 26, 2015 and
September 27, 2014, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain
of its manufacturing vendors resulting from the sale of components
to these vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final
products for the Company. The Company purchases these components
directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of
the Company’s vendors accounted for 38%, 18% and 14% of total
vendor non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2015 and
three of the Company’s vendors accounted for 51%, 16% and 14%
of total vendor non-trade receivables as of September 27,
2014.
