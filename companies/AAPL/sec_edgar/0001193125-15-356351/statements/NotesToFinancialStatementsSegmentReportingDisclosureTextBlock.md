| **      Segment Information and Geographic Data** | Note 11 - Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company reports segment information based on
the “management” approach. The management approach
designates the internal reporting used by management for making
decisions and assessing performance as the source of the
Company’s reportable operating segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a
geographic basis. The Company’s reportable operating segments
consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and Rest of
Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and South
America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as
India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment
includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific
segment includes Australia and those Asian countries not included
in the Company’s other reportable operating segments.
Although each reportable operating segment provides similar
hardware and software products and similar services, they are
managed separately to better align with the location of the
Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique
market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies
of the various segments are the same as those described in Note 1,
“ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its
reportable operating segments based on net sales and operating
income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally based on
the location of customers and sales through the Company’s
retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating
income for each segment includes net sales to third parties,
related cost of sales and operating expenses directly attributable
to the segment. Advertising expenses are generally included in the
geographic segment in which the expenditures are incurred.
Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating
segments. Costs excluded from segment operating income include
various corporate expenses such as R& D, corporate marketing
expenses, certain share-based compensation expenses, income taxes,
various nonrecurring charges and other separately managed general
and administrative costs. The Company does not include intercompany
transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.

The following table shows information by reportable
operating segment for 2015, 2014 and 2013 (in millions):
