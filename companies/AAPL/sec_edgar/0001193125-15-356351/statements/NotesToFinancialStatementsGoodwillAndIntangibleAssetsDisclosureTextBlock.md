On July 31, 2014, the Company completed the
acquisitions of Beats Music, LLC, which offers a subscription
streaming music service, and Beats Electronics, LLC, which makes
Beats®headphones, speakers and audio software (collectively,
“ Beats”). The total purchase price consideration for
these acquisitions was $2.6 billion, which consisted primarily of
cash, of which $2.2 billion was allocated to goodwill, $636 million
to acquired intangible assets and $258 million to net liabilities
assumed. Concurrent with the close of the acquisitions, the Company
repaid $295 million of existing Beats outstanding debt to
third-party creditors. In conjunction with the Beats acquisitions,
the Company issued approximately 5.1 million shares of its
common stock to certain former equity holders of Beats. The
restricted stock was valued at approximately $485 million based on
the Company’s common stock on the acquisition date. The
majority of these shares, valued at approximately $417 million,
will vest over time based on continued employment with Apple.

The Company also completed various other business
acquisitions during 2014 for an aggregate cash consideration, net
of cash acquired, of $957 million, of which $828 million was
allocated to goodwill, $257 million to acquired intangible assets
and $128 million to net liabilities assumed.
