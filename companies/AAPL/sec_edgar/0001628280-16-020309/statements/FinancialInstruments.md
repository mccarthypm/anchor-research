The Company may sell certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated 
maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to, anticipation of 
credit deterioration and duration management. The maturities of the Company’s 
long-term marketable securities generally range fromonetofive years.

The Company considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities 
investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The Company typically invests in
highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits the amount 
of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy generally requires investments 
to be investment grade, with the primary objective of minimizing the potential 
risk of principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security
in the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for 
other-than-temporary impairment the Company reviews factors such as the length 
of time and extent to which fair value has been below its cost basis, the 
financial condition of the issuer and any changes thereto, changes in market 
interest rates and the Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely 
than not it will be required to sell the investment before recovery of the 
investment’s cost basis. As ofSeptember 24, 2016, the Company does not consider 
any of its investments to be other-than-temporarily impaired.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to 
foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, on net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and 
liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for 
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations 
and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be 
no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact 
resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.
S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar and who sell in 
local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not 
denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter 
into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this 
risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company 
typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated
with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to12 months.

To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency 
forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of 
these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In 
addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its 
foreign currency-denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net investments in 
certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates 
these instruments as net investment hedges.

The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to 
partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the
re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional 
currencies.

The Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to
manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changes in 
income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or 
investments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or 
fair value hedges. The Company’s hedged interest rate transactions as 
ofSeptember 24, 2016are expected to be recognized within10 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash 
flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net 
sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred 
gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are 
recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related 
costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges
of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in 
the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective 
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
are recognized in other income/(expense), net.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as 
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in 
the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time 
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative 
instruments are reclassified immediately into other income/(expense), net. Any 
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in
other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other 
transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other 
comprehensive income (“ OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation 
adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness
testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in 
earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value 
of the underlying hedged item.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the 
derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair 
value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is 
based on its hedge designation. The following tables show the Company’s 
derivative instruments at gross fair value as ofSeptember 24, 2016andSeptember 
26, 2015(in millions):

The notional amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide one measure 
of the transaction volume outstanding and do not represent the amount of the 
Company’s exposure to credit or market loss. The credit risk amounts represent 
the Company’s gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative 
instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties failed to 
perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current currency 
or interest rates at each respective date. The Company’s exposure to credit loss
and market risk will vary over time as currency and interest rates change. 
Although the table above reflects the notional and credit risk amounts of the 
Company’s derivative instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses 
associated with the exposures and transactions that the instruments are intended
to hedge. The amounts ultimately realized upon settlement of these financial 
instruments, together with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, 
will depend on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the 
instruments.

The Company generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are 
designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with
the same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company generally 
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be 
received or posted when the net fair value of certain financial instruments 
fluctuates from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its 
derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values in its 
Consolidated Balance Sheets. The net cash collateral received by the Company 
related to derivative instruments under its collateral security arrangements 
was$163 millionas ofSeptember 24, 2016and$1.0 billionas ofSeptember 26, 2015, 
which were recorded as accrued expenses in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

Under master netting arrangements with the respective counterparties to the 
Company’s derivative contracts, the Company is allowed to net settle 
transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to the other. As 
ofSeptember 24, 2016andSeptember 26, 2015, the potential effects of these rights
of set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the 
effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and 
derivative liabilities of$1.5 billionand$2.2 billion, respectively, resulting in
a net derivative asset of$160 millionand a net derivative liability of$78 
million, respectively.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party 
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added resellers, small 
and mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The
Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the 
Company will require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In 
addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade 
receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or by requiring 
third-party financing, loans or leases to support credit exposure. These 
credit-financing arrangements are directly between the third-party financing 
company and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not assume any
recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

As ofSeptember 24, 2016andSeptember 26, 2015, the Company hadonecustomer that 
represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, which accounted 
for10%and12%, respectively. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted 
for63%and71%of trade receivables as ofSeptember 24, 2016andSeptember 26, 2015, 
respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors 
resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture 
sub-assemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases
these components directly from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables fromtwoof
the Company’s vendors accounted for47%and21%of total vendor non-trade 
receivables as ofSeptember 24, 2016andthreeof the Company’s vendors accounted 
for38%,18%and14%of total vendor non-trade receivables as ofSeptember 26, 2015.
