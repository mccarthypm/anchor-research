2014 Employee Stock Plan

In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock 
Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new 
awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan 
provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive 
officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based 
awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus 
awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest overfour years, based on
continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s 
common stock on aone-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to RSUs 
granted under the 2014 Plan reduces the number of shares available for grant 
under the plan bytwoshares. RSUs cancelled and shares withheld to satisfy tax 
withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under 
the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor oftwotimes the number of RSUs cancelled or 
shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend 
equivalent rights (“ DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend 
value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting
and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are 
accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 
Plan, the Company reserved385 millionshares plus the number of shares remaining 
that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject to 
outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are cancelled or otherwise 
terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations with respect 
to RSUs, will also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As ofSeptember 
24, 2016, approximately386.4 millionshares were reserved for future issuance 
under the 2014 Plan.

2003 Employee Stock Plan

The 2003 Plan is a shareholder approved plan that provided for broad-based 
equity grants to employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan 
permitted the granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options, 
RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and performance-based 
awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan generally expireseventoten 
yearsafter the grant date and generally become exercisable over a period offour 
years, based on continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or 
quarterly vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest overtwotofour
years, based on continued employment and are settled upon vesting in shares of 
the Company’s common stock on aone-for-one basis. All RSUs, other than RSUs held
by the Chief Executive Officer, granted under the 2003 Plan have DERs. DERs are 
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the corresponding 
unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. In
the second quarter of 2014, the Company terminated the authority to grant new 
awards under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Director Stock Plan

The 1997 Director Stock Plan (the “ Director Plan”) is a shareholder approved 
plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs or stock options to 
the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial grants
of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of Directors and 
automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of shareholders, and 
(iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change the relative 
mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and 
the methodology for determining the number of shares of the Company’s common 
stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each share issued 
with respect to RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of 
shares available for grant under the plan bytwoshares. The Director Plan 
expiresNovember 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director Plan are entitled 
to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as 
the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid when the 
underlying shares vest. As ofSeptember 24, 2016, approximately1.1 millionshares 
were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.

  Balance at September 24, 2016              99,089                $97.54  

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was$5.1 billion,$4.8 
billionand$3.4 billionfor2016,2015and2014, respectively. The majority of RSUs 
that vested in2016,2015and2014were net-share settled such that the Company 
withheld shares with value equivalent to the employees’ minimum statutory 
obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted 
the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were 
approximately15.9 million,14.1 millionand15.6 millionfor2016,2015and2014, 
respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective 
vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments
for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were$1.7 billion,$1.6 
billionand$1.2 billionin2016,2015and2014, respectively, and are reflected as a 
financing activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows. These 
net-share settlements had the effect of share repurchases by the Company as they
reduced the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result 
of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.
