| **  Basis of Presentation and Preparation** | Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the 
Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the 
opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for
fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting 
principles (“ GAAP”) requires management to make estimates and assumptions that 
affect the amounts reported in these consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates.
Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements have been 
reclassified to conform to the current period’s presentation.
 |
|   Fiscal Period | The Company’s fiscal year is the52or53-week period that ends on the last 
Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years2016,2015and2014ended 
onSeptember 24, 2016, September 26, 2015andSeptember 27, 2014, respectively, and
each spanned 52 weeks. An additional week is included in the first fiscal 
quarter approximately everyfiveorsix yearsto realign fiscal quarters with 
calendar quarters, which will next occur in the first quarter of the Company's 
fiscal year ending September 30, 2017. Unless otherwise stated, references to 
particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal 
years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of 
those fiscal years.
 |
| **  New Accounting Pronouncements** | During 2016, the Company adopted an accounting standard that simplified the 
presentation of deferred income taxes by requiring deferred tax assets and 
liabilities be classified as noncurrent in a classified statement of financial 
position. The Company has adopted this accounting standard prospectively; 
accordingly, the prior period amounts in the Company’s Consolidated Balance 
Sheets within this Annual Report on Form 10-K were not adjusted to conform to 
the new accounting standard. The adoption of this accounting standard was not 
material to the Company’s consolidated financial statements.
 |
| **  Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, 
digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support 
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an 
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or 
determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the 
customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these 
criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to 
individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U. S., and for certain
other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product 
because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during 
transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, 
revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive 
evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful 
history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The 
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled 
with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and 
third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general 
revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in 
accordance with industry specific software accounting guidance for the following
types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) 
sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not
essential to the functionality of the hardware.

For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based 
on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own 
pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products,
is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts 
billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store
and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the
Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the 
primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales 
on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from 
each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted 
by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners 
is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the
delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that 
have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and 
non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The 
Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also 
sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App 
Store and iBooks Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The 
Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved 
upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and 
support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. 
AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone 
support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools 
offered under the Company’s standard limited warranty.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to 
price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions 
involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated 
amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the 
estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which
the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. 
The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product 
returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of
taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, 
with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the 
relevant government authority.

Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing 
software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software
elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and 
undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all 
deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the 
Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for 
allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of 
fair value (“ VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“ TPE”) and 
(iii) best estimate of selling price (“ ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when 
the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged 
by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates 
of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a
stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance 
with industry specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates 
revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does 
not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.

For sales of qualifying versions of iPhone, iPad, iPod touch, Mac, Apple Watch 
and Apple TV, the Company has indicated it may from time to time provide future 
unspecified software upgrades to the device’s essential software and/or 
non-software services free of charge. The Company has identified up 
tothreedeliverables regularly included in arrangements involving the sale of 
these devices. The first deliverable, which represents the substantial portion 
of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and software essential to the 
functionality of the hardware device delivered at the time of sale. The second 
deliverable is the embedded right included with qualifying devices to receive on
a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to 
the product’s essential software. The third deliverable is the non-software 
services to be provided to qualifying devices. The Company allocates revenue 
between these deliverables using the relative selling price method. Because the 
Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for these deliverables, the allocation of 
revenue is based on the Company’s ESPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered 
hardware and the related essential software is recognized at the time of sale 
provided the other conditions for revenue recognition have been met. Revenue 
allocated to the embedded unspecified software upgrade rights and the 
non-software services is deferred and recognized on a straight-line basis over 
the estimated period the software upgrades and non-software services are 
expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and related
essential software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the 
time of sale. Costs incurred to provide non-software services are recognized as 
cost of sales as incurred, and engineering and sales and marketing costs are 
recognized as operating expenses as incurred.

The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or 
TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and
circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices 
charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, 
product specific business objectives, length of time a particular version of a 
device has been available, estimated cost to provide the non-software services 
and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as compared
to the total selling price of the product.
 |
| **  Shipping Costs** | Shipping Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as 
revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of
sales.
 |
|   Warranty Costs | Warranty Costs

The Company generally provides for the estimated cost of hardware and software 
warranties in the period the related revenue is recognized. The Company assesses
the adequacy of its accrued warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as 
necessary based on actual experience and changes in future estimates.
 |
| **  Software Development Costs** | Software Development Costs

Research and development (“ R& D”) costs are expensed as incurred. Development 
costs of computer software to be sold, leased, or otherwise marketed are subject
to capitalization beginning when a product’s technological feasibility has been 
established and ending when a product is available for general release to 
customers. In most instances, the Company’s products are released soon after 
technological feasibility has been established and as a result software 
development costs were expensed as incurred.
 |
| **  Advertising Costs** | Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.
 |
| **  Share-based Compensation** | Share-based Compensation

The Company recognizes expense related to share-based payment transactions in 
which it receives employee services in exchange for (a) equity instruments of 
the Company or (b) liabilities that are based on the fair value of the Company’s
equity instruments or that may be settled by the issuance of such equity 
instruments. Share-based compensation cost for restricted stock and restricted 
stock units (“ RSUs”) is measured based on the closing fair market value of the 
Company’s common stock on the date of grant. The Company recognizes share-based 
compensation cost over the award’s requisite service period on a straight-line 
basis for time-based RSUs and on a graded basis for RSUs that are contingent on 
the achievement of performance conditions. The Company recognizes a benefit from
share-based compensation in the Consolidated Statements of Shareholders’ Equity 
if an excess tax benefit is realized. In addition, the Company recognizes the 
indirect effects of share-based compensation on R& D tax credits, foreign tax 
credits and domestic manufacturing deductions in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found 
in Note 9, “ Benefit Plans.”
 |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

The provision for income taxes is computed using the asset and liability method,
under which deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the expected 
future tax consequences of temporary differences between the financial reporting
and tax bases of assets and liabilities and for operating losses and tax credit 
carryforwards. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using the 
currently enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in effect for the years
in which those tax assets and liabilities are expected to be realized or 
settled. The Company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets
to the amount that is believed more likely than not to be realized.

The Company recognizes the tax benefit from an uncertain tax position only if it
is more likely than not the tax position will be sustained on examination by the
taxing authorities, based on the technical merits of the position. The tax 
benefits recognized in the financial statements from such positions are then 
measured based on the largest benefit that has a greater than50%likelihood of 
being realized upon settlement. See Note 5, “ Income Taxes” for additional 
information.
 |
| **  Earnings Per Share** | Potentially dilutive securities whose effect would have been antidilutive are 
excluded from the computation of diluted earnings per share.

Earnings Per Share

Basic earnings per share is computed by dividing income available to common 
shareholders by the weighted-average number of shares of common stock 
outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings per share is computed by 
dividing income available to common shareholders by the weighted-average number 
of shares of common stock outstanding during the period increased to include the
number of additional shares of common stock that would have been outstanding if 
the potentially dilutive securities had been issued. Potentially dilutive 
securities include outstanding stock options, shares to be purchased by 
employees under the Company’s employee stock purchase plan, unvested restricted 
stock and unvested RSUs. The dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities 
is reflected in diluted earnings per share by application of the treasury stock 
method. Under the treasury stock method, an increase in the fair market value of
the Company’s common stock can result in a greater dilutive effect from 
potentially dilutive securities.
 |
| **  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities** | Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s marketable 
debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as 
available-for-sale. Management determines the appropriate classification of its 
investments at the time of purchase and reevaluates the classifications at each 
balance sheet date. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as 
either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual
maturity date. Marketable debt securities with maturities of 12 months or less 
are classified as short-term and marketable debt securities with maturities 
greater than 12 months are classified as long-term. Marketable equity 
securities, including mutual funds, are classified as either short-term or 
long-term based on the nature of each security and its availability for use in 
current operations. The Company’s marketable debt and equity securities are 
carried at fair value, with unrealized gains and losses, net of taxes, reported 
as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income (“ AOCI”) in 
shareholders’ equity, with the exception of unrealized losses believed to be 
other-than-temporary which are reported in earnings in the current period. The 
cost of securities sold is based upon the specific identification method.
 |
| **  Derivative Financial Instruments** | Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company accounts for its derivative instruments as either assets or 
liabilities and carries them at fair value.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to variability in expected 
future cash flows that are designated as cash flow hedges, the effective portion
of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument is reported as a component of 
AOCI in shareholders’ equity and reclassified into earnings in the same period 
or periods during which the hedged transaction affects earnings. The ineffective
portion of the gain or loss on the derivative instrument, if any, is recognized 
in earnings in the current period. To receive hedge accounting treatment, cash 
flow hedges must be highly effective in offsetting changes to expected future 
cash flows on hedged transactions. For options designated as cash flow hedges, 
changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and are recognized in earnings.

For derivative instruments that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value 
of an asset or a liability and that are designated as fair value hedges, both 
the net gain or loss on the derivative instrument as well as the offsetting gain
or loss on the hedged item are recognized in earnings in the current period.

For derivative instruments and foreign currency debt that hedge the exposure to 
changes in foreign currency exchange rates used for translation of the net 
investment in a foreign operation and that are designated as a net investment 
hedge, the net gain or loss on the effective portion of the derivative 
instrument is reported in the same manner as a foreign currency translation 
adjustment. For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, 
the Company excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward 
carry component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or 
losses related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the
current period.

Derivatives that do not qualify as hedges are adjusted to fair value through 
earnings in the current period.

Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to 
foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, on net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries and on certain existing assets and 
liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for 
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations 
and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be 
no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact 
resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U.
S. dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar and who sell in 
local currencies may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not 
denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The Company may enter 
into forward contracts, option contracts or other instruments to manage this 
risk and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company 
typically hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure associated
with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to12 months.

To help protect the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes 
in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency 
forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the carrying amounts of 
these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates. In 
addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, such as its 
foreign currency-denominated debt, as economic hedges of its net investments in 
certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company designates 
these instruments as net investment hedges.

The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to 
partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the
re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional 
currencies.

The Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to
manage interest rate risk. These instruments may offset a portion of changes in 
income or expense, or changes in fair value of the Company’s term debt or 
investments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or 
fair value hedges. The Company’s hedged interest rate transactions as 
ofSeptember 24, 2016are expected to be recognized within10 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in AOCI until the hedged
item is recognized in earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash 
flow hedges of foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net 
sales in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred 
gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are 
recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same period as the related 
costs are recognized. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges
of interest income or expense are recognized in other income/(expense), net in 
the same period as the related income or expense is recognized. The ineffective 
portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges
are recognized in other income/(expense), net.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as 
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in 
the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time 
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative 
instruments are reclassified immediately into other income/(expense), net. Any 
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in
other income/(expense), net unless they are re-designated as hedges of other 
transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other 
comprehensive income (“ OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation 
adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness
testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in 
earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value 
of the underlying hedged item.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the 
derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair 
value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is 
based on its hedge designation.
 |
|   Allowance for Doubtful Accounts | Allowance for Doubtful Accounts

The Company records its allowance for doubtful accounts based upon its 
assessment of various factors, including historical experience, age of the 
accounts receivable balances, credit quality of the Company’s customers, current
economic conditions and other factors that may affect the customers’ abilities 
to pay.
 |
| **  Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are stated at the lower of cost, computed using the first-in, 
first-out method and net realizable value. Any adjustments to reduce the cost of
inventories to their net realizable value are recognized in earnings in the 
current period. As ofSeptember 24, 2016andSeptember 26, 2015, the Company’s 
inventories consist primarily of finished goods.
 |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation is computed by 
use of the straight-line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets, 
which for buildings is the lesser of30 yearsor the remaining life of the 
underlying building; betweenonetofive yearsfor machinery and equipment, 
including product tooling and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter 
of lease terms or useful life for leasehold improvements. The Company 
capitalizes eligible costs to acquire or develop internal-use software that are 
incurred subsequent to the preliminary project stage. Capitalized costs related 
to internal-use software are amortized using the straight-line method over the 
estimated useful lives of the assets, which range fromthreetofive years.
 |
| **  Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets** | Long-Lived Assets Including Goodwill and Other Acquired Intangible Assets

The Company reviews property, plant and equipment, inventory component 
prepayments and identifiable intangibles, excluding goodwill and intangible 
assets with indefinite useful lives, for impairment. Long-lived assets are 
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the
carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable. Recoverability of these 
assets is measured by comparison of their carrying amounts to future 
undiscounted cash flows the assets are expected to generate. If property, plant 
and equipment, inventory component prepayments and certain identifiable 
intangibles are considered to be impaired, the impairment to be recognized 
equals the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds its fair 
value.

The Company doesnotamortize goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite 
useful lives, rather such assets are required to be tested for impairment at 
least annually or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the assets may be impaired. The Company performs its goodwill and 
intangible asset impairment tests in the fourth quarter of each year. The 
Company did not recognize any impairment charges related to goodwill or 
indefinite lived intangible assets during2016,2015and2014. For purposes of 
testing goodwill for impairment, the Company established reporting units based 
on its current reporting structure. Goodwill has been allocated to these 
reporting units to the extent it relates to each reporting unit. In2016and2015, 
the Company’s goodwill was primarily allocated to the Americas and Europe 
reporting units.

The Company amortizes its intangible assets with definite useful lives over 
their estimated useful lives and reviews these assets for impairment. The 
Company typically amortizes its acquired intangible assets with definite useful 
lives over periods fromthreetoseven years.
 |
| **  Fair Value Measurements** | Fair Value Measurements

The Company applies fair value accounting for all financial assets and 
liabilities and non-financial assets and liabilities that are recognized or 
disclosed at fair value in the financial statements on a recurring basis. The 
Company defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling an 
asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market 
participants at the measurement date. When determining the fair value 
measurements for assets and liabilities, which are required to be recorded at 
fair value, the Company considers the principal or most advantageous market in 
which the Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or 
assumptions that market participants would use to price the asset or liability, 
such as risks inherent in valuation techniques, transfer restrictions and credit
risk. Fair value is estimated by applying the following hierarchy, which 
prioritizes the inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases 
the categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input that is 
available and significant to the fair value measurement:

Level 1 - Quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.

Level 2 - Observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets 
or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can 
be corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the
assets or liabilities.

Level 3 - Inputs that are generally unobservable and typically reflect 
management’s estimate of assumptions that market participants would use in 
pricing the asset or liability.

The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money 
market funds and certain marketable equity securities were derived from quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation 
techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and 
all other financial instruments, all of which have counterparties with high 
credit ratings, were valued based on quoted market prices or model-driven 
valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable 
market data.

In accordance with the fair value accounting requirements, companies may choose 
to measure eligible financial instruments and certain other items at fair value.
The Company has not elected the fair value option for any eligible financial 
instruments.
 |
| **  Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement** | Foreign Currency Translation and Remeasurement

The Company translates the assets and liabilities of its non-U. S. dollar 
functional currency subsidiaries into U. S. dollars using exchange rates in 
effect at the end of each period. Revenue and expenses for these subsidiaries 
are translated using rates that approximate those in effect during the period. 
Gains and losses from these translations are recognized in foreign currency 
translation included in AOCI in shareholders’ equity. The Company’s subsidiaries
that use the U. S. dollar as their functional currency remeasure monetary assets
and liabilities at exchange rates in effect at the end of each period, and 
inventories, property and nonmonetary assets and liabilities at historical 
rates.
