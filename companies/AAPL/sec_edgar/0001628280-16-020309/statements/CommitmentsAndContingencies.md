The Company generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and 
application software against legal claims that the software infringes 
third-party intellectual property rights. Other agreements entered into by the 
Company sometimes include indemnification provisions under which the Company 
could be subject to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim 
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. In the opinion of management,
there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a 
material loss with respect to indemnification of end-users of its operating 
system or application software for infringement of third-party intellectual 
property rights.

The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers 
who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U. S., the U. K. and mainland China. The
iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for 
a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are
met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and 
recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right with 
subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and 
executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify 
such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that
arise by reason of their status as directors or officers and to advance expenses
incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is
not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the Company 
could be required to make under these agreements due to the limited history of 
prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and circumstances involved in 
each claim. However, the Company maintains directors and officers liability 
insurance coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally 
available from multiple sources, a number of components are currently obtained 
from single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various 
components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and 
media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the 
Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times 
subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing fluctuations that 
could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and 
operating results.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its 
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom 
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields
have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of
components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an 
outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the 
Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially 
adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also 
be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain 
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain 
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of 
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if those 
suppliers concentrated on the production of common components instead of 
components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; 
however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or 
renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company 
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases 
that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating 
results.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by 
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A significant 
concentration of this manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of 
outsourcing partners, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing 
partners are the sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many
of the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its 
outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating results
could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners were unable to meet 
their production commitments. The Company’s manufacturing purchase obligations 
typically cover its requirements for periods up to150 days.

Other Off-Balance Sheet Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, 
under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently
utilize any other off-balance sheet financing arrangements. As ofSeptember 24, 
2016, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable 
operating leases were$7.6 billion. The Company's retail store and other facility
leases are typically for terms not exceeding10 yearsand generally contain 
multi-year renewal options.

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and 
noncancelable leases, was$939 million,$794 millionand$717 
millionin2016,2015and2014, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under 
noncancelable operating leases having remaining terms in excess of one year as 
ofSeptember 24, 2016, are as follows (in millions):

        2017      $          929  
        2018      919             
        2019      915             
        2020      889             
        2021      836             
  Thereafter               3,139  
       Total      $        7,627  

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen 
in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as 
further discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “ Risk 
Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “ Legal 
Proceedings.” In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable 
possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in
excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies for asserted 
legal and other claims. However, the outcome of litigation is inherently 
uncertain. Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an 
outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were resolved 
against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s 
expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements for that reporting
period could be materially adversely affected.

Apple Inc. v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd., et al.

On August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the Company$1.05 
billionin its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd. and affiliated 
parties in the United States District Court, Northern District of California, 
San Jose Division. On March 6, 2014, the District Court entered final judgment 
in favor of the Company in the amount of approximately$930 million. On May 18, 
2015, the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit affirmed in part, and 
reversed in part, the decision of the District Court. As a result, the Court of 
Appeals ordered entry of final judgment on damages in the amount of 
approximately$548 million, with the District Court to determine supplemental 
damages and interest, as well as damages owed for products subject to the 
reversal in part. Samsung paid$548 millionto the Company in December 2015, which
was included in net sales in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of Operations.
Because the case remains subject to further proceedings, the Company has not 
recognized any further amounts in its results of operations. On October 11, 
2016, the United States Supreme Court heard arguments in Samsung’s request for 
appeal related to the$548 millionin damages.
