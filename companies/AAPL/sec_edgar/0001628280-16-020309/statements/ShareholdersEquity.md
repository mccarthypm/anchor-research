Share Repurchase Program

In April 2016, the Company’s Board of Directors increased the share repurchase 
authorization from$140 billionto$175 billionof the Company’s common stock, of 
which$133 billionhad been utilized as ofSeptember 24, 2016. The Company’s share 
repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific number of 
shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in privately negotiated 
and/or open market transactions, including under plans complying with Rule 
10b5-1 under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange 
Act”).

The Company has entered, and in the future may enter, into accelerated share 
repurchase arrangements (“ ASRs”) with financial institutions. In exchange for 
up-front payments, the financial institutions deliver shares of the Company’s 
common stock during the purchase periods of each ASR. The total number of shares
ultimately delivered, and therefore the average repurchase price paid per share,
is determined at the end of the applicable purchase period of each ASR based on 
the volume weighted-average price of the Company’s common stock during that 
period. The shares received are retired in the periods they are delivered, and 
the up-front payments are accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity 
in the Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheets in the periods the payments are 
made. The Company reflects the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock in the 
period delivered for purposes of calculating earnings per share and as forward 
contracts indexed to its own common stock. The ASRs met all of the applicable 
criteria for equity classification, and therefore were not accounted for as 
derivative instruments.

during the years endedSeptember 24, 2016andSeptember 26, 2015:
