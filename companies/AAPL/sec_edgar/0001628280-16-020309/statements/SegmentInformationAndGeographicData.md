The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The 
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for 
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s 
reportable operating segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable operating segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, 
Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. The Americas segment includes both North and 
South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as well as India,
the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China segment includes China, Hong Kong 
and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia Pacific segment includes Australia and those Asian 
countries not included in the Company’s other reportable operating segments. 
Although the reportable operating segments provide similar hardware and software
products and similar services, each one is managed separately to better align 
with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution partners and the 
unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The accounting policies of the
various segments are the same as those described in Note 1, “ Summary of 
Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable operating segments based
on net sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are 
generally based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s 
retail stores located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each 
segment includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are 
generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are 
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense 
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable operating segments. Costs 
excluded from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such 
as R& D, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based compensation 
expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other separately 
managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not include 
intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting purposes.
