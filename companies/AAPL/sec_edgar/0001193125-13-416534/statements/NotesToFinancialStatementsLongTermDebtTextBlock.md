Debt

In May 2013,
the Company issued floating- and fixed-rate notes with varying
maturities for an aggregate principal amount of $17.0 billion
(collectively the “ Notes”). The Notes are senior
unsecured obligations, and interest is payable in arrears,
quarterly for the floating-rate notes and semi-annually for the
fixed-rate notes.

The principal
amounts and associated interest rates of the Notes as of
September 28, 2013, are as follows:

                                  Amount                           
                                  (in                              
                                  millions)                        
 ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Floating-rate notes, due        $               1,000      0.51  
  Floating-rate notes, due                        2,000      1.10  
  Fixed-rate 0.45% notes due                      1,500      0.51  
  Fixed-rate 1.00% notes due                      4,000      1.08  
  Fixed-rate 2.40% notes due                      5,500      2.44  
  Fixed-rate 3.85% notes due                      3,000      3.91  
  Total                           $              17,000            

The
floating-rate notes due 2016 and 2018 bear interest at the
three-month London InterBank Offered Rate (“ LIBOR”)
plus 0.05% and 0.25%, respectively. To manage the risk of
fluctuations in interest rates associated with the floating-rate
notes, the Company entered into interest rate swaps with an
aggregate notional amount of $3.0 billion designated as cash flow
hedges of its floating-rate notes. These hedges effectively convert
the floating interest rate on the floating-rate notes to a fixed
interest rate. The gains and losses related to changes in the fair
value of the interest rate swaps are recorded in OCI with a portion
reclassified to interest expense each period to offset changes in
interest rates on the floating-rate notes. The effective rates for
the Notes include the interest on the Notes, amortization of the
discount and, if applicable, adjustments related to hedging. The
Company recognized $136 million of interest expense for the year
ended September 28, 2013. As of September 28, 2013, the
aggregate unamortized discount for the Company’s Notes was
$40 million.

Future
principal payments for the Company’s Notes as of
September 28, 2013, are as follows (in millions):

        2014           0  
        2015           0  
        2016       2,500  
        2017           0  
        2018       6,000  
  Thereafter       8,500  
       Total      17,000  

As of
September 28, 2013, the fair value of the Company’s
Notes, based on Level 2 inputs, was $15.9 billion.
