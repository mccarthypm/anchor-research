The Company
paid cash dividends of $2.65 per share, totaling $2.5 billion,
during the fourth quarter of 2012. Future dividends are subject to
declaration by the Board of Directors.

In 2012, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to
repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company’s common stock
beginning in 2013. In April 2013, the Company’s Board of
Directors increased the share repurchase program authorization from
$10 billion to $60 billion, of which $23.0 billion had been
utilized as of September 28, 2013. The Company’s share
repurchase program does not obligate it to acquire any specific
number of shares. Under the program, shares may be repurchased in
privately negotiated and/or open market transactions, including
under plans complying with Rule 10b5-1 of the Securities Exchange
Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange
Act”).

In August 2012,
the Company entered into an accelerated share repurchase
arrangement (“ ASR”) with a financial institution to
purchase up to $1.95 billion of the Company’s common stock in
2013. In the first quarter of 2013, 2.6 million shares were
initially delivered to the Company. In April 2013, the purchase
period for the ASR ended and an additional 1.5 million shares
were delivered to the Company.  In total, 4.1 million
shares were delivered under the ASR at an average repurchase price
of $478.20 per share. The shares were retired in the quarters they
were delivered, and the up-front payment of $1.95 billion was
accounted for as a reduction to shareholders’ equity in the
Company’s Consolidated Balance Sheet in the first quarter of
2013.

In April 2013,
the Company entered into a new ASR program with two financial
institutions to purchase up to $12 billion of the Company’s
common stock. In exchange for up-front payments totaling $12
billion, the financial institutions committed to deliver shares
during the ASR’s purchase periods, which will end during
2014. The total number of shares ultimately delivered, and
therefore the average price paid per share, will be determined at
the end of the applicable purchase period based on the volume
weighted average price of the Company’s stock during that
period. During the third quarter of 2013, 23.5 million shares
were initially delivered to the Company and retired. This does not
represent the final number of shares to be delivered under the ASR.
The up-front payments of $12 billion were accounted for as a
reduction to shareholders’ equity in the Company’s
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

The Company
reflected the ASRs as a repurchase of common stock for purposes of
calculating earnings per share and as forward contracts indexed to
its own common stock. The forward contracts met all of the
applicable criteria for equity classification, and, therefore, were
not accounted for as derivative instruments.

During 2013,
the Company repurchased 19.4 million shares of its common
stock in the open market at an average price of $464.11 per share
for a total of $9.0 billion. These shares were retired upon
repurchase.
