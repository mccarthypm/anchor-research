The net
unrealized losses as of September 28, 2013 and the net
unrealized gains as of September 29, 2012 are related
primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell
certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated
maturities for strategic reasons including, but not limited to,
anticipation of credit deterioration and duration management.
During 2013, 2012 and 2011, the net realized gains recognized by
the Company were not significant. The maturities of the
Company’s long-term marketable securities generally range
from one to five years.

As of
September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, gross
unrealized losses related to individual securities that had been in
a continuous loss position for 12 months or longer were not
significant.

As of
September 28, 2013, the Company considered the declines in
market value of its marketable securities investment portfolio to
be temporary in nature and did not consider any of its investments
other-than-temporarily impaired. The Company typically invests in
highly-rated securities, and its investment policy generally limits
the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. The policy
requires investments generally to be investment grade, with the
primary objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal
loss. Fair values were determined for each individual security in
the investment portfolio. When evaluating an investment for
other-than-temporary impairment, the Company reviews factors such
as the length of time and extent to which fair value has been below
its cost basis, the financial condition of the issuer and any
changes thereto, changes in market interest rates, and the
Company’s intent to sell, or whether it is more likely than
not it will be required to sell, the investment before recovery of
the investment’s cost basis. During 2013, 2012 and 2011 the
Company did not recognize any significant impairment
charges.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company
uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to
foreign currency and interest rate risk. The Company may enter into
forward contracts, option contracts, swaps, or other derivative
instruments to offset some of the risk on expected future cash
flows, on net investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and on
certain existing assets and liabilities.

To help protect
gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates,
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
currency is the U. S. dollar hedge a portion of forecasted foreign
currency revenue. The Company’s subsidiaries whose functional
currency is not the U. S. dollar and who sell in local currencies
may hedge a portion of forecasted inventory purchases not
denominated in the subsidiaries’ functional currencies. The
Company hedges a portion of its forecasted foreign currency
exposure associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically
for up to 12 months.

To help protect
the net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the
carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates.

To help protect
against adverse fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may
enter into interest rate swaps, options, or other instruments to
offset a portion of the changes in income or expense due to
fluctuations in interest rates.

The Company may
also enter into foreign currency forward and option contracts to
partially offset the foreign currency exchange gains and losses
generated by the re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities
denominated in non-functional currencies. However, the Company may
choose not to hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting
considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from
movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

The Company
records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair
value. The Company’s accounting treatment of these
instruments is based on whether the instruments are designated as
hedge or non-hedge

The Company had
net deferred losses of $175 million and $240 million associated
with cash flow hedges, net of taxes, recorded in AOCI as of
September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012, respectively.
Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of
foreign currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales
in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and
deferred gains and losses related to cash flow hedges of inventory
purchases are recognized as a component of cost of sales in the
same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and
losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or
expense are recognized as a component of other income/(expense),
net in the same period as the related income or expense is
recognized. The Company’s hedged foreign currency
transactions and hedged interest rate transactions as of
September 28, 2013 are expected to occur within 12 months and
five years, respectively.

Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will
not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent two-month time period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI
associated with such derivative instruments are reclassified
immediately into other income and expense. Any subsequent changes
in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in other
income and expense unless they are re-designated as hedges of other
transactions. The Company did not recognize any significant net
gains or losses related to the loss of hedge designation on
discontinued cash flow hedges during 2013, 2012 and
2011.

The
Company’s unrealized net gains and losses on net investment
hedges, included in the cumulative translation adjustment account
of AOCI, were not significant as of September 28, 2013 and
September 29, 2012. The ineffective portions of and amounts
excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment hedges are
recorded in other income and expense.

The gain/loss
recognized in other income and expense for foreign currency forward
and option contracts not designated as hedging instruments was not
significant during 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. These amounts
represent the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do
not include changes in the related exposures, which generally
offset a portion of the gain or loss on the derivative
contracts.

The following
table shows the notional principal amounts of the Company’s
outstanding derivative instruments and credit risk amounts
associated with outstanding or unsettled derivative instruments as
of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012 (in

The notional
principal amounts for outstanding derivative instruments provide
one measure of the transaction volume outstanding and do not
represent the amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or
market loss. The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s
gross exposure to potential accounting loss on derivative
instruments that are outstanding or unsettled if all counterparties
failed to perform according to the terms of the contract, based on then-current

The Company
generally enters into master netting arrangements, which are
designed to reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of
transactions with the same counterparty. To further limit credit
risk, the Company generally enters into collateral security
arrangements that provide for collateral to be received or posted
when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates
from contractually established thresholds. The Company presents its
derivative assets and derivative liabilities at their gross fair
values. As of September 28, 2013 and September 29, 2012,
the Company posted $164 million and $278 million, respectively, of
cash collateral related to the derivative instruments under its
collateral security arrangements, which were recorded as other
current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet.  The Company
did not have any derivative instruments with credit-risk related
contingent features that would require it to post additional
collateral as of September 28, 2013 or September 29,
2012.

Accounts
Receivable

Trade
Receivables

The Company has
considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, value-added
resellers, small and mid-sized businesses, and education,
enterprise and government customers. The Company generally does not
require collateral from its customers; however, the Company will
require collateral in certain instances to limit credit risk. In
addition, when possible, the Company attempts to limit credit risk
on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain customers or
by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support
credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly
between the third-party financing company and the end customer. As
such, the Company generally does not assume any recourse or credit
risk sharing related to any of these arrangements.

As of
September 28, 2013, the Company had two customers that
represented 10% or more of total trade receivables, one of which
accounted for 13% and the other 10%. As of September 29, 2012,
the Company had two customers that represented 10% or more of total
trade receivables, one of which accounted for 14% and the other
10%. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for
68% and 66% of trade receivables as of September 28, 2013 and
September 29, 2012, respectively. The additions and write-offs
to the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts during 2013,
2012 and 2011 were not significant.

Vendor
Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has
non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors
resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products
for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly
from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from three of the
Company’s vendors accounted for 47%, 21% and 15% of total
non-trade receivables as of September 28, 2013 and vendor
non-trade receivables from three of the Company’s vendors
accounted for 45%, 21% and 12% of total non-trade receivables as of
September 29, 2012. The Company does not reflect the sale of
these components in net sales and does not recognize any profits on
these sales until the related products are sold by the Company, at
which time any profit is recognized as a reduction of cost of
sales.
