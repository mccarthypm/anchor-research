Accrued Warranty and
Indemnification

The Company
offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware
products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is
typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day

The following
table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and
related costs for 2013, 2012 and 2011 (in millions):

The Company
generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other
agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject
to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the
Company has not been required to make any significant payments
resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not
have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement
claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely
affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the
Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related
to indemnification as of either September 28, 2013 or
September 29, 2012.

The Company has
entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and
executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed
to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by
law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as
directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not
possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the
Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the
Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance
coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments
made under these agreements historically have not been
material.

Concentrations in the
Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most
components essential to the Company’s business are generally
available from multiple sources, a number of components are
currently obtained from single or limited sources. In addition, the
Company competes for various components with other participants in
the markets for mobile communication and media devices and personal
computers. Therefore, many components used by the Company,
including those that are available from multiple sources, are at
times subject to industry-wide shortage and significant pricing
fluctuations that can materially adversely affect the
Company’s financial condition and operating
results.

The Company
uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often
utilize custom components available from only one source. When a
component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity
constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have
matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Company’s supply of components for a new or existing product
were delayed or constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed
shipments of completed products to the Company, the Company’s
financial condition and operating results could be materially
adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial
performance could also be materially adversely affected depending
on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from the
original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities
from an alternative source. Continued availability of these
components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if
those suppliers concentrated on the production of common components
instead of components customized to meet the Company’s
requirements.

The Company has
entered into various agreements for the supply of components;
however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to
extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.
Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of
supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely
affect its financial condition and operating results.

Substantially
all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A
significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently
performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in
single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the
sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of
the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely
with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the
Company’s operating results could be adversely affected if
its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production
commitments. The Company’s purchase commitments typically
cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.

Other Off-Balance Sheet
Commitments

Lease
Commitments

The Company
leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space,
under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does
not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not
exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms
not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are
for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are
for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of
September 28, 2013, the Company’s total future minimum
lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.7
billion, of which $3.5 billion related to leases for retail
space.

Rent expense
under all operating leases, including both cancelable and
noncancelable leases, was $645 million, $488 million and $338
million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. Future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining
terms in excess of one year as of September 28, 2013, are as
follows (in millions):

                 2014        610  
                 2015        613  
                 2016        587  
                 2017        551  
                 2018        505  
           Thereafter      1,855  
  Total minimum lease      4,721  

Other
Commitments

As of
September 28, 2013, the Company had outstanding off-balance
sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
commitments of $18.6 billion.

In addition to
the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had
outstanding obligations of $1.3 billion as of September 28,
2013, which consisted mainly of commitments to acquire capital
assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and
development, Internet and telecommunications services and other
obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is
subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully
adjudicated. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a
reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material
loss, or a material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with
respect to loss contingencies. However, the outcome of litigation
is inherently uncertain. Therefore, although management considers
the likelihood of such an outcome to be remote, if one or more of
these legal matters were resolved against the Company in a
reporting period for amounts in excess of management’s
expectations, the Company’s consolidated financial statements
for that reporting period could be materially adversely
affected.

Apple Inc.
v. Samsung Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.

On
August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the
Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics
Co., Ltd and affiliated parties in the United States District
Court, Northern District of California, San Jose Division. On
March 1, 2013, the District Court upheld $599 million of the
jury’s award and ordered a new trial as to the remainder.
Because the award is subject to entry of final judgment, partial
re-trial and appeal, the Company has not recognized the award
in its results of operations.

VirnetX,
Inc. v. Apple Inc. et al.

On
August 11, 2010, VirnetX, Inc. filed an action against the
Company alleging that certain of its products infringed on four
patents relating to network communications technology. On
November 6, 2012, a jury returned a verdict against the
Company, and awarded damages of $368 million. The Company is
challenging the verdict, believes it has valid defenses and has not
recorded a loss accrual at this time.
