2003
Employee Stock Plan

The 2003
Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”) is a shareholder
approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to
employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the
granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options,
RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and
performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan
generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and
generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly
vesting. RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan generally vest over two
to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon
vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a
one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to an award
granted under the 2003 Plan (other than a stock option or stock
appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for
grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in
respect of an option or stock appreciation right count against the
number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. All
RSUs, other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted
under the 2003 Plan have dividend equivalent rights
(“ DER”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same
dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DER are
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the
corresponding unvested RSUs. DER are accumulated and paid when the
underlying shares vest. As of September 28, 2013,
approximately 28.3 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the 2003 Plan.

1997
Director Stock Plan

The 1997
Director Stock Plan (the “ Director Plan”) is a
shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to
grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s
non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial
grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of
Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual
meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of
Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock
options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the
methodology for determining the number of shares of the
Company’s common stock subject to these grants without
shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs
granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares
available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan
expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director
Plan are entitled to DER. As of September 28, 2013,
approximately 176,000 shares were reserved for future issuance
under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1
Trading Plans

During the
fourth quarter of 2013, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter
Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Philip W. Schiller, Daniel Riccio and
Jeffrey E. Williams and director William V. Campbell had equity
trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) under
the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written document that
pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or
sales of the Company’s stock, including shares acquired
pursuant to the Company’s employee and director equity
plans.

Employee
Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “ Purchase Plan”) is a
shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month
offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s
compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of
stock during any calendar year. As of September 28, 2013,
approximately 1.8 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the Purchase Plan.

401(k)
Plan

The
Company’s 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) is a
deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U. S.
employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the
IRS annual contribution limit ($17,500 for calendar year 2013). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employee’s eligible earnings. The Company’s matching
contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $135 million, $114 million
and $90 million in 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively.

  Balance at September 28,      13,326        $435.70  

The fair value
as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $3.1 billion, $3.3
billion and $1.5 billion for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The
majority of RSUs that vested in 2013, 2012 and 2011 were net-share
settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent
to the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the
applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash
to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld
were approximately 2.2 million, 2.3 million and
1.6 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and were
based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as
determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total
payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing
authorities were $1.1 billion, $1.2 billion and $520 million in
2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively, and are reflected as a financing
activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.  These net-share settlements had the effect of share
repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number
of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the
vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.
