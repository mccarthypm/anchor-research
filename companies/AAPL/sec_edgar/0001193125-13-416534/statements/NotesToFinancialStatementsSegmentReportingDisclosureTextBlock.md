Information and Geographic Data

The Company
reports segment information based on the “management”
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting
used by management for making decisions and assessing performance
as the source of the Company’s reportable
segments.

The Company
manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The
Company’s reportable operating segments consist of the
Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan, Rest of Asia Pacific and
Retail operations. The Americas segment includes both North and
South America. The Europe segment includes European countries, as
well as India, the Middle East and Africa. The Greater China
segment includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. The Rest of Asia
Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other than
those countries included in the Company’s other operating
segments. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13
countries, including the U. S. The results of the Company’s
geographic segments do not include results of the Retail segment.
Each operating segment provides similar hardware and software
products and similar services. The accounting policies of the
various segments are the same as those described in Note 1,
“ Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies.”

The Company
evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment
net sales are based on sales through the Company’s retail
stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to
third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are
generally included in the geographic segment in which the
expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed
outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment
operating income include various corporate expenses such as
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based
compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges,
and other separately managed general and administrative costs and
certain manufacturing period expenses. The Company does not include
intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting
purposes.

Segment assets
include receivables and inventories, and for the Retail segment
also includes capital assets. Segment assets exclude corporate
assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term
marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other
long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities,
product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for
long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and
therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and
instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital
asset purchases by the Retail segment were $495 million, $858
million and $612 million for 2013, 2012 and 2011, respectively. The
Company’s total depreciation and amortization was $6.8
billion, $3.3 billion and $1.8 billion in 2013, 2012 and 2011,
respectively, of which $382 million, $319 million and $273 million
was related to the Retail segment in the respective years.
Depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the
geographic segments was not significant.
