The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, 
including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases 
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain 
multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. The
Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and nonlease components. The
Company has elected to combine and account for lease and nonlease components as 
a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center 
facilities.

Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and 
variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the 
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the 
Company’s operating leases were $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 2021 and 2020,
respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s 
leases were $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 2021 and 2020, respectively. Rent
expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease 
accounting standards, was $1.3 billion in 2019.

The Company made $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to
operating leases in 2021 and 2020, respectively. Noncash activities involving 
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $3.3
billion for 2021 and $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting 
FASB ASU No. 2016-02, Leases(Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.

The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated 
financial statement line items, as of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020

not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2022 and 2023, with lease
