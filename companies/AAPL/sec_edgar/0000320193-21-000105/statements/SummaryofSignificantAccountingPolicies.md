Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s 
management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which
are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement 
presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s 
presentation.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last 
Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal 
quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with 
calendar quarters. The Company’s fiscal years 2021, 2020 and 2019 spanned 52 
weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, 
months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and 
the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Financial Instruments - Credit Losses

At the beginning of the first quarter of 2021, the Company adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 
No. 2016-13, Financial Instruments - Credit Losses (Topic 326): Measurement of 
Credit Losses on Financial Instruments(“ASU 2016-13”), which modifies the 
measurement of expected credit losses on certain financial instruments. The 
Company adopted ASU 2016-13 utilizing the modified retrospective transition 
method. The adoption of ASU 2016-13 did not have a material impact on the 
Company’s condensed consolidated financial statements.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense
on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately 
vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”

Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per 
share for 2021, 2020 and 2019 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):

                                                 2021                      2020

3.28      $               2.97  

The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect 
of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing
62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted 
earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt 
securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s 
underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).

The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based 
on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current 
operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair 
value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI& E”).

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.

Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the 
lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one five

Noncash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted in
a net decrease to accounts payable and other current liabilities of $2.9 billion
during 2019.

Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities

The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when 
withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted 
cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current 
or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.
The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current 
marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the 
classification of the underlying securities.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on
intended use and hedge designation.

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of 
cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings
when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow 
hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge 
relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of 
fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and
gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange 
forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the 
forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and 
recognizes it in OI& E on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. 
Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness are recognized in OCI.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative 
instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative 
instruments relate.

The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair 
values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows 
related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable 
equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s
debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have 
counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or 
model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.
