The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers 
who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U. S., the U. K. and China mainland. The
iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for 
a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are
met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and 
recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with 
subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within net sales.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally 
available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from 
single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, 
wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, 
including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject 
to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its 
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom 
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields
have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued 
availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be 
affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common 
components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; 
however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or 
renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by 
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers
manufactured in the U. S. and Ireland.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off - balance sheet commitments that 
require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase 
obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily 
consist of payments for content creation, Internet and telecommunications 
services and supplier arrangements. Future payments under noncancelable 
unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year
as of September 25, 2021, are as follows (in millions):

        2022      $        4,551  
        2023               2,165  
        2024      984             
        2025      405             
        2026      51              
  Thereafter      28              
       Total      $        8,184  

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen 
in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The 
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. When a loss related to a legal 
proceeding or claim is probable and reasonably estimable, the Company accrues 
its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of the matter. If one or more 
legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for 
amounts above management’s expectations, the Company’s financial condition and 
operating results for that reporting period could be materially adversely 
affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a reasonable 
possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss 
greater than a recorded accrual, concerning loss contingencies for asserted 
legal and other claims, except for the following matters:

VirnetX

VirnetX, Inc. (“VirnetX”) filed a lawsuit against the Company alleging that 
certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by VirnetX. On April
11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict against the Company in the U. S. District 
Court for the Eastern District of Texas (the “Eastern Texas District Court”). 
The Company appealed the verdict to the U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal 
Circuit, which remanded the case back to the Eastern Texas District Court, where
a retrial was held in October 2020. The jury returned a verdict against the 
Company and awarded damages of $503 million, which the Company has appealed. The
Company has challenged the validity of the patents at issue in the retrial at 
the U. S. Patent and Trademark Office (the “PTO”), and the PTO has declared the 
patents invalid, subject to further appeal by VirnetX.

iOS Performance Management Cases

On April 5, 2018, several U. S. federal actions alleging violation of consumer 
protection laws, fraud, computer intrusion and other causes of action related to
the Company’s performance management feature used in its iPhone operating 
systems, introduced to certain iPhones in iOS updates 10.2.1 and 11.2, were 
consolidated through a Multidistrict Litigation process into a single action in 
the U. S. District Court for the Northern District of California (the “Northern 
California District Court”). On February 28, 2020, the parties in the 
Multidistrict Litigation reached a settlement to resolve the U. S. federal and 
California state class actions. On March 18, 2021, the Northern California 
District Court granted final approval of the Multidistrict Litigation 
settlement, which will result in an aggregate payment of $310 million to settle 
all claims. The Company continues to believe that its iPhones were not 
defective, that the performance management feature introduced with iOS updates 
10.2.1 and 11.2 was intended to, and did, improve customers’ user experience, 
and that the Company did not make any misleading statements or fail to disclose 
any material information.

French Competition Authority

On March 16, 2020, the French Competition Authority (“FCA”) announced its 
decision that aspects of the Company’s sales and distribution practices in 
France violate French competition law, and issued a fine of €1.1 billion. The 
Company strongly disagrees with the FCA’s decision, and has appealed.

Optis

Optis Wireless Technology, LLC and related entities (“Optis”) filed a lawsuit in
the U. S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas against the Company 
alleging that certain of the Company’s products infringe on patents owned by 
Optis. On August 11, 2020, a jury returned a verdict against the Company and 
awarded damages. In post-trial proceedings, the damages portion of the verdict 
was set aside. A retrial on damages was held in August 2021 and the jury in that
proceeding awarded damages of $300 million against the Company, which the 
Company plans to appeal.
