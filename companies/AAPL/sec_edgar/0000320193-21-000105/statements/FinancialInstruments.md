(1) Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets 
for identical assets or liabilities.

(2) Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than 
quoted prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted 
prices for identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or 
other inputs that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market 
data for substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

(3) As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, total marketable securities
included $17.9 billion and $18.6 billion, respectively, that was restricted from
general use, related to the State Aid Decision (refer to Note 5, “Income Taxes”)
and other agreements.

The Company may sell certain of its marketable debt securities prior to their 
stated maturities for reasons including, but not limited to, managing liquidity,
credit risk, duration and asset allocation. The following table shows the fair 
value of the Company’s non-current marketable debt securities, by contractual 
maturity, as of September 25, 2021 (in millions):

  Due after 1 year through 5 years         83,755  
  Due after 5 years through 10 years       23,915  
  Due after 10 years                       20,207  
  Total fair value                        127,877  

The Company typically invests in highly rated securities, with the primary 
objective of minimizing the potential risk of principal loss. The Company’s 
investment policy generally requires securities to be investment grade and 
limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer. Fair values were 
determined for each individual security in the investment portfolio.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business 
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may 
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including, but 
not limited to, accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of 
hedging particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset 
more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign 
exchange or interest rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, 
the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other 
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The 
Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure 
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may
enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The 
Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. 
As of September 25, 2021, the Company’s hedged term debt - and marketable 
securities - related foreign currency transactions are expected to be recognized
within 21 years.

The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated 
as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign 
currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain 
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in
interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or 
fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of 
September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020 were as follows (in millions):

                                                                   2021

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party 
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and 
mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The 
Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the 
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain 
instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts
to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain 
customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support 
credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the 
third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company 
generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of 
these arrangements.

As of both September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020, the Company had no 
customers that individually represented 10% or more of total trade receivables. 
The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for 42% of total trade 
receivables as of September 25, 2021.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors 
resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture 
subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases 
these components directly from suppliers. As of September 25, 2021, the Company 
had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor 
non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%. As of September 26,
