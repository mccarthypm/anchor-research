The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of 
$68.7 billion, $38.1 billion and $44.3 billion in 2021, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively.

applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2021, 2020 and 2019) to 
income before provision for income taxes for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the 
future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated 
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and 
their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply 
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled. The Company has elected to record certain deferred 
tax assets and liabilities in connection with the minimum tax on certain foreign
earnings created by the U. S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).

As of September 25, 2021, the Company had $2.6 billion in foreign tax credit 
carryforwards in Ireland and $1.6 billion in California research and development
credit carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A 
valuation allowance has been recorded for the tax credit carryforwards and a 
portion of other temporary differences.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of September 25, 2021, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits 
was $15.5 billion, of which $6.6 billion, if recognized, would impact the 
Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of 
gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if 
recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which 
excludes interest and penalties, for 2021, 2020 and 2019, is as follows (in 
millions):

                                                                        2021

15,477      $          16,475      $          15,619  

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S. 
federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 
2015 for the U. S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign
jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Although the timing of resolution 
and/or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is 
reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in 
the next 12 months by as much as $1.2 billion.

Interest and Penalties

The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within
the provision for income taxes. As of September 25, 2021 and September 26, 2020,
the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.5 billion and 
$1.4 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense 
of $219 million, $85 million and $73 million in 2021, 2020 and 2019, 
respectively.

European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland 
granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 
concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two 
subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision 
ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for 
the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective
as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that 
date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus 
interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid 
Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the
“General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid 
Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General 
Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any
incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State 
Aid Decision would be creditable against U. S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax
credit limitations in the Act.

On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for
Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries.
As of September 25, 2021, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, 
excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into 
escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion 
of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable 
Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.
