The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
CEO is its CODM.

The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater 
China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South 
America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East 
and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of
Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not 
included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable 
segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, 
each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the 
Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of 
each geographic region.

The CODM uses segment net sales and operating income information to make certain
decisions, such as product and service pricing, and to decide how to allocate 
resources related to sales activities and marketing investments. Net sales for 
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales 
through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. 
Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, 
related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the 
segment. The information provided to the CODM for purposes of making decisions 
and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.

The following tables show information by reportable segment for 2025, 2024 and 
2023 (in millions):
