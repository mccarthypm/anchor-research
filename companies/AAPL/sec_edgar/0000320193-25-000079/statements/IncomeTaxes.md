European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the Commission announced its decision that Ireland granted 
state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 concerning 
the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two subsidiaries of the 
Company (“State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered Ireland to 
calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the period June 2003
through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective as of January 2015, 
eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that date forward.

The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid Decision to the General Court of 
the Court of Justice of the European Union (“General Court”). On July 15, 2020, 
the General Court annulled the State Aid Decision. On September 25, 2020, the 
Commission appealed the General Court’s decision to the European Court of 
Justice (“ECJ”). On September 10, 2024, the ECJ announced that it had set aside 
the 2020 judgment of the General Court and confirmed the Commission’s 2016 State
Aid Decision. As a result, during the fourth quarter of 2024 the Company 
recorded a one-time income tax charge of $10.2 billion, net, which represented 
$15.8 billion payable to Ireland via release of amounts held in escrow, 
partially offset by a U. S. foreign tax credit of $4.8 billion and a decrease in
unrecognized tax benefits of $823 million.

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S. 
federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years 2018 
and after 2021 for the U. S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain 
major foreign jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Altho ugh the timing
of resolution or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it
is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease 
as much as $6 billion in the next 12 months.
