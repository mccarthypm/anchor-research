As of September 27, 2025, 80% of the Company’s non-current marketable debt 
securities other than mortgage- and asset-backed securities had maturities

asset-backed securities had maturities between 1 and 5 years, 14% between 5 and 
10 years, and 73% greater than 10 years.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt 
securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument’s 
underlying maturity.

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business 
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may 
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including 
accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion 
of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest
rates.

All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on
intended use and hedge designation.

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of 
cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other 
comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the
hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from amounts 
that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the 
hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in 
value of the hedged item.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges, 
amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of 
amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in 
other comprehensive income/(loss).

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative 
instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same 
section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, 
which are generally classified as operating activities.

Foreign Exchange Rate Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the 
Company may use forwards, options or other instruments, and may designate these 
instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its 
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory 
purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates, the Company may use 
forwards, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The Company designates 
these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 27, 
2025, the maximum length of time over which the Company is hedging its exposure 
to the variability in future cash flows for term debt - related foreign currency
transactions is 17 years.

The Company may also use derivative instruments that are not designated as 
accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in foreign 
exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign currency gains and
losses generated by the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities 
denominated in non-functional currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in
interest rates, the Company may use interest rate swaps, options or other 
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or 
fair value hedges.

The notional amounts of the Company’s outstanding derivative instruments as of 
September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, were as follows (in millions):

                                                                   2025

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

As of September 27, 2025, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or 
more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 12%. The Company’s 
third-party cellular network carriers accounted for 34% and 38% of total trade 
receivables as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024, respectively. The 
Company requires third-party credit support or collateral from certain customers
to limit credit risk.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors 
resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture 
subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases 
these components directly from suppliers. The Company does not reflect the sale 
of these components in products net sales. Rather, the Company recognizes any 
gain on these sales as a reduction of products cost of sales when the related 
final products are sold by the Company. As of September 27, 2025, the Company 
had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor 
non-trade receivables, which accounted for 46% and 23%. As of September 28, 
2024, the Company had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of 
total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 44% and 23%.
