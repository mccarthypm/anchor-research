Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off - balance sheet commitments that 
require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase 
obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily 
consist of supplier arrangements, licensed intellectual property and content, 
and distribution rights. Future payments under unconditional purchase 
obligations with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 27, 
2025, are as follows (in millions):

        2026      $         4,752  
        2027                3,708  
        2028                1,981  
        2029                1,306  
        2030      788              
  Thereafter      773              
       Total      $        13,308  

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen 
in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The 
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, 
there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a 
material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning 
loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally 
available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from 
single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, 
wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, 
including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject 
to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations. 
Restrictions on international trade can increase the cost or limit the 
availability of the Company’s products and the components and rare earths and 
other raw materials that go into them.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its 
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom 
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields
have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The Company has 
entered into agreements for the supply of many components; however, the Company 
may not be able to extend or renew agreements for the supply of components on 
similar terms, or at all, and may not be successful in obtaining sufficient 
quantities from its suppliers or in a timely manner, or in identifying and 
obtaining sufficient quantities from an alternative source. In addition, 
component suppliers may fail, be subject to consolidation within a particular 
industry, or decide to concentrate on the production of common components 
instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements, further 
limiting the Company’s ability to obtain sufficient quantities of components on 
commercially reasonable terms, or at all.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by 
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in China mainland, India, Japan,
South Korea, Taiwan and Vietnam.
