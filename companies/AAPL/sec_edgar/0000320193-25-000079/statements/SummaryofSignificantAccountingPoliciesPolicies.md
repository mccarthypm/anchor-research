Segment Reporting

Beginning with the 2025 annual reporting period, the Company adopted the FASB’s 
ASU No. 2023-07, Segment Reporting (Topic 280): Improvements to Reportable 
Segment Disclosures(“ASU 2023-07”), which requires the Company to disclose 
segment expenses that are significant and regularly provided to the Company’s 
chief operating decision maker (“CODM”). In addition, ASU 2023-07 requires the 
Company to disclose the title and position of its CODM and how the CODM uses 
segment profit or loss information in assessing segment performance and deciding
how to allocate resources. The Company adopted ASU 2023-07 using a retrospective
transition method.
 |
| **  Revenue** | Revenue

The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are 
remitted to governmental authorities.

The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled 
when control of products or services is transferred to its customers. Control is
generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment and title 
and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or services are 
transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products net sales, 
control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s Services net 
sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. Payment for 
Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period following 
transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product 
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the 
Company’s expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises
within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all 
distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling 
prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine
SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that 
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the 
performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone 
basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices 
considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and 
circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where 
applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends 
in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and 
the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified the performance obligations regularly included in 
arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac and iPad. The first material 
performance obligation, which represents the substantial portion of the 
allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled software delivered at the 
time of sale. The second material performance obligation is the right to receive
certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud®, Siri® and Maps.
The Company allocates revenue and any related discounts to all of its 
performance obligations based on their relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks 
observable prices for product-related bundled services, the allocation of 
revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the 
delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized when control has 
transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the product is shipped.
Revenue allocated to product-related bundled services is deferred and recognized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be 
provided.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance 
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the 
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company 
has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of 
the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, 
and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the 
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue 
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple 
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, 
including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains 
inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring 
acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App 
Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it
to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application
- related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the 
commission it retains.
 |
|   Share-Based Compensation | Share-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis
for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.

The Company estimates the grant-date fair value of RSUs based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant.
 |
| **  Cash Equivalents** | Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.
 |
|   Trade Receivables | Trade Receivables

Trade receivables are stated at transaction price.
 |
|   Marketable Securities | Marketable Securities

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt 
securities as either current or non-current based on each instrument’s 
underlying maturity.
 |
| **  Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.
 |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost. Depreciation on property, 
plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line basis.
 |
| **  Derivative Instruments** | Derivative Instruments

The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair 
values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on
intended use and hedge designation.

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of 
cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other 
comprehensive income/(loss) and subsequently reclassified into earnings when the
hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. Gains and losses arising from amounts 
that are included in the assessment of fair value hedge effectiveness are 
recognized in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the 
hedge relates along with offsetting losses and gains related to the change in 
value of the hedged item.

For derivative instruments designated as cash flow and fair value hedges, 
amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the life of the hedge in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations line item to which the hedge relates. Changes in the fair value of 
amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in 
other comprehensive income/(loss).

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative 
instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same 
section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, 
which are generally classified as operating activities.
 |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection 
with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the TCJA.
 |
| **  Leases** | Leases

The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single 
lease component for leases of corporate and retail facilities.

The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally 
based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount 
rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.
 |
| **  Fair Value Measurements** | The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 
2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit 
ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using 
significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.
 |
| **  Segment Reporting** | The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
CEO is its CODM.

The Company’s reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater 
China, Japan and Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South 
America. Europe includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East 
and Africa. Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of
Asia Pacific includes Australia, New Zealand and those Asian countries not 
included in the Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable 
segments provide similar hardware and software products and similar services, 
each one is managed separately to better align with the location of the 
Company’s customers and distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of 
each geographic region.

The CODM uses segment net sales and operating income information to make certain
decisions, such as product and service pricing, and to decide how to allocate 
resources related to sales activities and marketing investments. Net sales for 
geographic segments are generally based on the location of customers and sales 
through the Company’s retail stores located in those geographic locations. 
Operating income for each segment consists of net sales to third parties, 
related cost of sales, and operating expenses directly attributable to the 
segment. The information provided to the CODM for purposes of making decisions 
and assessing segment performance excludes asset information.
