2022 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (“2022 Plan”) is a shareholder-approved 
plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including 
executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, 
performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs 
granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on continued 
employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock
on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have dividend 
equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend value per 
share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares 
were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan 
was approved on March 4, 2022.

 ────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
  Balance as of September 28, 2024       163,326               $158.73  
  RSUs granted                            73,466               $226.68  
  RSUs vested                           (76,845)               $159.85  
  RSUs forfeited                         (8,373)               $183.03  
  Balance as of September 27, 2025       151,574               $189.75  

The weighted-average grant-date fair value of RSUs granted in 2024 and 2023 was 
$173.78 and $150.87, respectively. The Company estimates the grant-date fair 
value of RSUs based on the closing price of the Company’s common stock on the 
date of grant.

The total vesting-date fair value of RSUs was $17.1 billion, $15.8 billion and 
$15.9 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively. The majority of RSUs that 
vested in 2025, 2024 and 2023 were net share settled such that the Company 
withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ obligation for the 
applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted cash to the 
appropriate taxing authorities. Total payments to taxing authorities for 
employees’ tax obligations were $6.1 billion in 2025 and $5.6 billion in both 
2024 and 2023.
