The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, 
including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases 
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain 
multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.

Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and 
variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the 
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the 
Company’s operating leases were $2.1 billion for 2025 and $2.0 billion for both 
2024 and 2023. Lease costs associated with variable payments on the Company’s 
leases were $16.1 billion, $13.8 billion and $13.9 billion for 2025, 2024 and 
2023, respectively.

The Company made fixed cash payments related to operating leases of $2.1 billion
in 2025 and $1.9 billion in both 2024 and 2023. Noncash activities involving 
right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange for lease liabilities were $2.8
billion, $1.0 billion and $2.1 billion for 2025, 2024 and 2023, respectively.

The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated 
financial statement line items, as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024

liabilities as of September 27, 2025 and September 28, 2024 was 3.4% and 3.1%, 
respectively. The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are 
generally based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the
discount rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.

As of September 27, 2025, the Company had $523 million of fixed payment 
obligations under additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and 
retail space, that had not yet commenced. These leases are expected to commence 
between 2026 and 2027, with lease terms ranging from 1 year to 21 years.
