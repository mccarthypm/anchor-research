Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally 
available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from 
single or limited sources. The Company also competes for various components with
other participants in the markets for smartphones, personal computers, tablets, 
wearables and accessories. Therefore, many components used by the Company, 
including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times subject 
to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its 
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom 
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields
have matured or their manufacturing capacities have increased. The continued 
availability of these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be 
affected if suppliers decide to concentrate on the production of common 
components instead of components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by 
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers
manufactured in the U. S. and Ireland.

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off - balance sheet commitments that 
require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase 
obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily 
consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet services and content 
creation. Future payments under noncancelable unconditional purchase obligations
with a remaining term in excess of one year as of September 24, 2022, are as 
follows (in millions):

        2023      $        13,488  
        2024                4,876  
        2025                1,418  
        2026                6,780  
        2027      312              
  Thereafter      412              
       Total      $        27,286  

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen 
in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully resolved. The 
outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. In the opinion of management, 
there was not at least a reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a 
material loss, or a material loss greater than a recorded accrual, concerning 
loss contingencies for asserted legal and other claims.
