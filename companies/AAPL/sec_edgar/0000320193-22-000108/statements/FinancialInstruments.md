Derivative Instruments and Hedging

The Company may use derivative instruments to partially offset its business 
exposure to foreign exchange and interest rate risk. However, the Company may 
choose not to hedge certain exposures for a variety of reasons including 
accounting considerations or the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular
exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion 
of the financial impact resulting from movements in foreign exchange or interest
rates.

Foreign Exchange Risk

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, 
the Company may enter into forward contracts, option contracts or other 
instruments, and may designate these instruments as cash flow hedges. The 
Company generally hedges portions of its forecasted foreign currency exposure 
associated with revenue and inventory purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may
enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. The 
Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair value hedges. 
As of September 24, 2022, the maximum length of time over which the Company is 
hedging its exposure to the variability in future cash flows for term debt - 
related foreign currency transactions is 20 years.

The Company may also enter into derivative instruments that are not designated 
as accounting hedges to protect gross margins from certain fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates, as well as to offset a portion of the foreign 
currency exchange gains and losses generated by the remeasurement of certain 
assets and liabilities denominated in non-functional currencies.

Interest Rate Risk

To protect the Company’s term debt or marketable securities from fluctuations in
interest rates, the Company may enter into interest rate swaps, options or other
instruments. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or 
fair value hedges.

(1) Derivative assets are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are 
included in other current assets and other non-current assets in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

(2) Derivative liabilities are measured using Level 2 fair value inputs and are 
included in other current liabilities and other non-current liabilities in the 
Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The derivative assets above represent the Company’s gross credit exposure if all
counterparties failed to perform. To mitigate credit risk, the Company generally
enters into collateral security arrangements that provide for collateral to be 
received or posted when the net fair values of certain derivatives fluctuate 
from contractually established thresholds. To further limit credit risk, the 
Company generally enters into master netting arrangements with the respective 
counterparties to the Company’s derivative contracts, under which the Company is
allowed to settle transactions with a single net amount payable by one party to 
the other. As of September 24, 2022, the potential effects of these rights of 
set-off associated with the Company’s derivative contracts, including the 
effects of collateral, would be a reduction to both derivative assets and 
derivative liabilities of $7.8 billion, resulting in a net derivative asset of 
$412 million.

Accounts Receivable

Trade Receivables

The Company has considerable trade receivables outstanding with its third-party 
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers, resellers, small and 
mid-sized businesses and education, enterprise and government customers. The 
Company generally does not require collateral from its customers; however, the 
Company will require collateral or third-party credit support in certain 
instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the Company attempts
to limit credit risk on trade receivables with credit insurance for certain 
customers or by requiring third-party financing, loans or leases to support 
credit exposure. These credit-financing arrangements are directly between the 
third-party financing company and the end customer. As such, the Company 
generally does not assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of 
these arrangements.

As of September 24, 2022, the Company had one customer that represented 10% or 
more of total trade receivables, which accounted for 10%. The Company’s cellular
network carriers accounted for 44% and 42% of total trade receivables as of 
September 24, 2022 and September 25, 2021, respectively.

Vendor Non-Trade Receivables

The Company has non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors 
resulting from the sale of components to these vendors who manufacture 
subassemblies or assemble final products for the Company. The Company purchases 
these components directly from suppliers. As of September 24, 2022, the Company 
had two vendors that individually represented 10% or more of total vendor 
non-trade receivables, which accounted for 54% and 13%. As of September 25, 
2021, the Company had three vendors that individually represented 10% or more of
total vendor non-trade receivables, which accounted for 52%, 11% and 11%.
