The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, 
including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases 
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain 
multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.

Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and 
variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the 
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the 
Company’s operating leases were $1.9 billion, $1.7 billion and $1.5 billion for 
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments
on the Company’s leases were $14.9 billion, $12.9 billion and $9.3 billion for 
2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.

The Company made $1.8 billion, $1.4 billion and $1.5 billion of fixed cash 
payments related to operating leases in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. 
Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange 
for lease liabilities were $2.8 billion for 2022, $3.3 billion for 2021 and 
$10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of adopting the Financial 
Accounting Standards Board’s Accounting Standards Update No. 2016-02, Leases 
(Topic 842) in the first quarter of 2020.
