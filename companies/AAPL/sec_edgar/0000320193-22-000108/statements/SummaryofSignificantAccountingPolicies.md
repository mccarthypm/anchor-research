Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. The preparation of these 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U. 
S. generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make 
estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could
differ materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified 
to conform to the current period’s presentation.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last 
Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal 
quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with 
calendar quarters, which will occur in the first quarter of the Company’s fiscal
year ending September 30, 2023. The Company’s fiscal years 2022, 2021 and 2020 
spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, 
quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in 
September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and 
other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects
to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its 
customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right
to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s
Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the 
Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are 
delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a 
short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of 
services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product 
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the 
Company’s expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises
within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all 
distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling 
prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine
SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that 
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the 
performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone 
basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices 
considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and 
circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where 
applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends 
in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and 
the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly 
included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain 
other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the 
substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled 
software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the
right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include 
iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to 
receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades 
relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue
and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their 
relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered 
performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s 
estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software
is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally 
occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related 
bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected 
to be provided. Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled 
software, including estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of 
sale. Costs incurred to provide product-related bundled services and unspecified
software upgrade rights are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance 
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the 
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company 
has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of 
the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, 
and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the 
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue 
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple 
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, 
including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains 
inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring 
acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App 
Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s other digital 
content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product before 
transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales 
on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it 
retains.

The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are 
remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded within 
other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government authority.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense
on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately 
vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”

Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per 
share for 2022, 2021 and 2020 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):

The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect 
of potentially dilutive securities.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt 
securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s 
underlying contractual maturity date.

The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based 
on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current 
operations.

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.

Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.

Restricted Marketable Securities

The Company considers marketable securities to be restricted when withdrawal or 
general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted marketable 
securities as current or non-current marketable securities in the Consolidated 
Balance Sheets based on the classification of the underlying securities.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the 
shorter of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one five

Derivative Instruments and Hedging

All derivative instruments are recorded in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at 
fair value. The accounting treatment for derivative gains and losses is based on
intended use and hedge designation.

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of 
cash flow hedge effectiveness are initially deferred in accumulated other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and subsequently reclassified into earnings
when the hedged transaction affects earnings, and in the same line item in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations. For options designated as cash flow 
hedges, the Company excludes time value from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and recognizes it on a straight-line basis over the life of the 
hedge in the Consolidated Statements of Operations line item to which the hedge 
relates. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness are recognized in other comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).

Gains and losses arising from amounts that are included in the assessment of 
fair value hedge effectiveness are recognized in the Consolidated Statements of 
Operations line item to which the hedge relates along with offsetting losses and
gains related to the change in value of the hedged item. For foreign exchange 
forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the Company excludes the 
forward carry component from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and 
recognizes it in other income/(expense), net (“OI& E”) on a straight-line basis 
over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from 
the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.

Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair values of derivative 
instruments that are not designated as accounting hedges are recognized in the 
Consolidated Statements of Operations line items to which the derivative 
instruments relate.

The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair 
values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The Company classifies cash flows 
related to derivative instruments as operating activities in the Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable 
equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s
debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have 
counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or 
model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.

Income Taxes

The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection 
with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the U. S. Tax Cuts 
and Jobs Act of 2017 (the “Act”).

Leases

The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single 
lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities. The 
discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally based on
estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates 
implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.

Segment Reporting

The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The 
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for 
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s 
reportable segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and 
Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. 
Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia 
Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the 
Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide 
similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed
separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and 
distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. 
The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described 
elsewhere in this Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net 
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally 
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores
located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment 
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating 
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are 
generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are 
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense 
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded 
from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as 
research and development (“R& D”), corporate marketing expenses, certain 
share-based compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges 
and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does 
not include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting 
purposes.
