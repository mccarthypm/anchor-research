2022 Employee Stock Plan

In the second quarter of 2022, shareholders approved the Apple Inc. 2022 
Employee Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”), which provides for broad-based equity 
grants to employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of 
restricted stock units (“RSUs”), stock grants, performance-based awards, stock 
options and stock appreciation rights. RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan 
generally vest over four years, based on continued employment, and are settled 
upon vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. 
RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan reduce the number of shares available for grant
under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. RSUs 
canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations increase the
number of shares available for grant under the 2022 Plan utilizing a factor of 
two times the number of RSUs canceled or shares withheld. All RSUs granted under
the 2022 Plan have dividend equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of
RSUs to the same dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are 
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the underlying 
RSUs. A maximum of approximately 1.3 billion shares were authorized for issuance
pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.

2014 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a 
shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to 
employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of
substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms 
as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus 
awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to 
grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.

Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a 
shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs 
or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for 
automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board 
of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of 
shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change 
the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and 
annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of 
the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the 
limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. 
RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for 
grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The 
Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director 
Plan are entitled to DERs, which are subject to the same vesting and other terms
and conditions as the underlying RSUs. A maximum of approximately 45 million 
shares (split-adjusted) were authorized for issuance pursuant to Director Plan 
awards at the time the plan was last amended on November 9, 2021.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved
plan under which substantially all employees may voluntarily enroll to purchase 
the Company’s common stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of
the lower of the fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end 
of six-month offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the 
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s eligible compensation and 
employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. 
A maximum of approximately 230 million shares (split-adjusted) were authorized 
for issuance under the Purchase Plan at the time the plan was last amended and 
restated on March 10, 2015.

401(k) Plan

The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a tax-qualified deferred compensation arrangement 
under Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, 
participating U. S. employees may contribute a portion of their eligible 
earnings, subject to applicable U. S. Internal Revenue Service and plan limits. 
The Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on 
length of service, up to a maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $18.2 billion, 
$19.0 billion and $10.8 billion for 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively. The 
majority of RSUs that vested in 2022, 2021 and 2020 were net share settled such 
that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ 
obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted 
the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were 
approximately 41 million, 53 million and 56 million for 2022, 2021 and 2020, 
respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective 
vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments
to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $6.4 billion, $6.8 
billion and $3.9 billion in 2022, 2021 and 2020, respectively.
