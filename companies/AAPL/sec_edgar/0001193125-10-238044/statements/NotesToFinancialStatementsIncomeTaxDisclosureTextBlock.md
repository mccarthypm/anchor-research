The foreign
provision for income taxes is based on foreign pretax earnings of
$13.0 billion, $6.6 billion and $4.6 billion in 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively. The Company’s consolidated financial
statements provide for any related tax liability on amounts that
may be repatriated, aside from undistributed earnings of certain of
the Company’s foreign subsidiaries that are intended to be
indefinitely reinvested in operations outside the U. S. As of
September 25, 2010, U. S. income taxes have not been provided
on a cumulative total of $12.3 billion of such earnings. The amount
of unrecognized deferred tax liability related to these temporary
differences is estimated to be approximately $4.0
billion.

As of
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, $30.8 billion
and $17.4 billion, respectively, of the Company’s cash, cash
equivalents and marketable securities were held by foreign
subsidiaries and are generally based in U. S. dollar-denominated
holdings. Amounts held by foreign subsidiaries are generally
subject to U. S. income taxation on repatriation to the
U. S.

Deferred tax
assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits,
and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between
the consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing
assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and are
measured using enacted tax rates that apply to taxable income in
the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be
recovered or settled.

As of
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, the
significant components of the Company’s deferred tax assets
and liabilities were (in millions):

A
reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount
computed by applying the statutory federal income tax rate (35% in
2010, 2009 and 2008) to income before provision for income taxes
for the three years ended September 25, 2010, is as follows

The
Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax
benefits from employee stock plan awards. For stock options, the
Company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference
between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of
the exercise and the option price, tax effected.  For RSUs, the
Company receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s
vesting equal to the tax effect of the underlying stock’s
fair market value. The Company had net excess tax benefits from
employee stock plan awards of $742 million, $246 million and $770
million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, which were reflected
as increases to common stock.

Uncertain Tax
Positions

Tax positions
are evaluated in a two-step process. The Company first determines
whether it is more likely than not that a tax position will be
sustained upon examination. If a tax position meets the
more-likely-than-not recognition threshold it is then measured to
determine the amount of benefit to recognize in the financial
statements. The tax position is measured as the largest amount of
benefit that is greater than 50% likely of being realized upon
ultimate settlement. The Company classifies gross interest and
penalties and unrecognized tax benefits that are not expected to
result in payment or receipt of cash within one year as non-current
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

As of
September 25, 2010, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits was $943 million, of which $404 million, if recognized,
would affect the Company’s effective tax rate. As of
September 26, 2009, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax
benefits was $971 million, of which $307 million, if recognized,
would affect the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate
changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which
excludes interest and penalties, for the three years ended
September 25, 2010, is as follows (in millions):

The Company
includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax
benefits within the provision for income taxes. As of
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, the total
amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $247 million and
$291 million, respectively, which is classified as non-current
liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In 2010 and 2009,
the Company recognized an interest benefit of $43 million and
interest expense of $64 million, respectively, in connection with
tax matters.

The Company is
subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S.
federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions.
For U. S. federal income tax purposes, all years prior to 2004 are
closed. The Internal Revenue Service (the “ IRS”) has
completed its field audit of the Company’s federal income tax
returns for the years 2004 through 2006 and proposed certain
adjustments. The Company has contested certain of these adjustments
through the IRS Appeals Office. The IRS is currently examining the
years 2007 through 2009. During the third quarter of 2010, the
Company reached a tax settlement with the IRS for the years 2002
through 2003. In connection with the settlement, the Company
reduced its gross unrecognized tax benefits by $100 million and
recognized a $52 million tax benefit in the third quarter of 2010.
In addition, the Company is also subject to audits by state, local
and foreign tax authorities.  In major states and major foreign
jurisdictions, the years subsequent to 1988 and 2001, respectively,
generally remain open and could be subject to examination by the
taxing authorities.

Management
believes that an adequate provision has been made for any
adjustments that may result from tax examinations. However, the
outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with certainty. If any
issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in
a manner not consistent with management’s expectations, the
Company could be required to adjust its provision for income tax in
the period such resolution occurs. Although timing of the
resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the Company
does not believe it is reasonably possible that its unrecognized
tax benefits would materially change in the next
12 months.
