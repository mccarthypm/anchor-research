| **      Fair Value Measurements** | Note 3 - Fair
Value Measurements

The Company
defines fair value as the price that would be received from selling
an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction
between market participants at the measurement date. When
determining the fair value measurements for assets and liabilities,
which are required to be recorded at fair value, the Company
considers the principal or most advantageous market in which the
Company would transact and the market-based risk measurements or
assumptions that market participants would use in pricing the asset
or liability, such as inherent risk, transfer restrictions and
credit risk.

The Company
applies the following fair value hierarchy, which prioritizes the
inputs used to measure fair value into three levels and bases the
categorization within the hierarchy upon the lowest level of input
that is available and significant to the fair value
measurement:

Level 1

Level 2

Level 3

The
Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value
of money market funds and certain marketable equity securities were
derived from quoted prices in active markets for identical assets
or liabilities. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair
value of all other financial instruments, all of which have
counterparties with high credit ratings, were valued based on
quoted market prices or model driven valuations using significant
inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market
data.
