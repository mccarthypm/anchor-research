Commitments and Contingencies

Lease
Commitments

The Company
leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space,
under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does
not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not
exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms
not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are
for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are
for ten years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of
September 25, 2010, the Company’s total future minimum
lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $2.1
billion, of which $1.7 billion related to leases for retail
space.

Rent expense
under all operating leases, including both cancelable and
noncancelable leases, was $271 million, $231 million and $207
million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining
terms in excess of one year as of September 25, 2010, are as
follows (in millions):

  Years                           
  2011                       266  
  2012                       267  
  2013                       260  
  2014                       244  
  2015                       226  
  Thereafter                 826  
  Total minimum lease      2,089  

Accrued Warranty and
Indemnifications

The Company
offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware
products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is
typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts
used to repair the Company’s hardware products. The Company
provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred
under its basic limited product warranties at the time related
revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the
size of the installed base of products subject to warranty
protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical
experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future estimates.

The Company
periodically provides updates to its applications and system
software to maintain the software’s compliance with published
specifications. The estimated cost to develop such updates is
accounted for as warranty costs that are recognized at the time
related software revenue is recognized. Factors considered in
determining appropriate accruals related to such updates include
the number of units delivered, the number of updates expected to
occur, and the historical cost and estimated future cost of the
resources necessary to develop these updates.

and related costs for the three years ended September 25, 2010
(in millions):

The Company
generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other
agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject
to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the
Company has not been required to make any significant payments
resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not
have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement
claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely
affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the
Company did not record a liability for infringement costs as of
either September 25, 2010 or September 26,
2009.

The Company has
entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and
executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed
to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by
law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as
directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not
possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the
Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the
Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance
coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments
made under these agreements historically have not materially
adversely affected the Company’s financial condition or
operating results.

Concentrations in the
Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most
components essential to the Company’s business are generally
available from multiple sources, certain key components including
but not limited to microprocessors, enclosures, certain liquid
crystal displays (“ LCDs”), certain optical drives and
application-specific integrated circuits (“ ASICs”) are
currently obtained by the Company from single or limited sources,
which subjects the Company to significant supply and pricing risks.
Many of these and other key components that are available from
multiple sources including but not limited to NAND flash memory,
dynamic random access memory (“ DRAM”) and certain LCDs,
are subject at times to industry-wide shortages and significant
commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the Company has
entered into certain agreements for the supply of key components
including but not limited to microprocessors, NAND flash memory,
DRAM and LCDs at favorable pricing, but there is no guarantee that
the Company will be able to extend or renew these agreements on
similar favorable terms, or at all, upon expiration or otherwise
obtain favorable pricing in the future. Therefore, the Company
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and/or
price increases that can materially adversely affect its financial
condition and operating results.

The Company and
other participants in the personal computer, and mobile
communication and media device industries also compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased
demand for their products. In addition, the Company uses some
custom components that are not common to the rest of these
industries, and new products introduced by the Company often
utilize custom components available from only one source. When a
component or product uses new technologies, initial capacity
constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields have
matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the
Company’s supply of a key single-sourced component for a new
or existing product were delayed or constrained, if such components
were available only at significantly higher prices, or if a key
manufacturing vendor delayed shipments of completed products to the
Company, the Company’s financial condition and operating
results could be materially adversely affected. The Company’s
business and financial performance could also be adversely affected
depending on the time required to obtain sufficient quantities from
the original source, or to identify and obtain sufficient
quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected
if those suppliers decided to concentrate on the production of
common components instead of components customized to meet the
Company’s requirements.

Substantially
all of the Company’s Macs, iPhones, iPads, iPods, logic
boards and other assembled products are now manufactured by
outsourcing partners, primarily in various parts of Asia. A
significant concentration of this outsourced manufacturing is
currently performed by only a few outsourcing partners of the
Company, often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing
partners are the sole-sourced supplier of components and
manufacturing outsourcing for many of the Company’s key
products including but not limited to final assembly of
substantially all of the Company’s Macs, iPhones, iPads and
iPods. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing
partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s operating
results could be adversely affected if its outsourcing partners
were unable to meet their production commitments. The
Company’s purchase commitments typically cover its
requirements for periods ranging from 30 to 150 days.

Long-Term Supply
Agreements

The Company has
entered into prepaid long-term supply agreements to secure the
supply of certain inventory components, which generally expire
between 2011 and 2015. As of September 25, 2010, the Company
had a total of $956 million of inventory component prepayments
outstanding, of which $157 million is classified as other current
assets and $799 million is classified as other assets in the
Consolidated Balance Sheets. In August 2010, the Company entered
into a long-term supply agreement under which it has committed to
prepay $500 million in 2011. The Company had a total of $1.2
billion of inventory component prepayments outstanding as of
September 26, 2009. These prepayments will be applied to
certain inventory component purchases made over the life of each
respective agreement.

Contingencies

The Company is
subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, which are discussed in Part I, Item 3 of this
Form 10-K under the heading “ Legal Proceedings.” In the
opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential
liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that
would individually or in the aggregate materially adversely affect
its financial condition or operating results. However, the results
of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. If the
Company failed to prevail in any of these legal matters or if
several of these legal matters were resolved against the Company in
the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular
reporting period could be materially adversely affected.

Production and
marketing of products in certain states and countries may subject
the Company to environmental, product safety and other regulations
including, in some instances, the requirement to provide customers
the ability to return product at the end of its useful life, and
place responsibility for environmentally safe disposal or recycling
with the Company. Such laws and regulations have been passed in
several jurisdictions in which the Company operates, including
various countries within Europe and Asia and certain states and
provinces within North America. Although the Company does not
anticipate any material adverse effects in the future based on the
nature of its operations and the thrust of such laws, there is no
assurance that such existing laws or future laws will not
materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition
or operating results.
