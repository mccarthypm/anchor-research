Shareholders’ Equity and Stock-Based
Compensation

Preferred
Stock

The Company has
five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is
issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company’s
Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is
authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the Company’s authorized but
unissued shares of preferred stock.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an
element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net
income. The Company’s other comprehensive income consists of
foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries
not using the U. S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities categorized as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain
derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow
hedges.

The following
table summarizes the components of AOCI, net of taxes, as of the
three years ended September 25, 2010 (in millions):

Employee Benefit
Plans

2003 Employee Stock
Plan

The 2003
Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”) is a shareholder
approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to
employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the
granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options,
RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and
performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan
generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and
generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly
vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two
to four years, are subject to the employees’ continued
employment and are paid upon vesting in shares of the
Company’s common stock on a one-for-one basis. At the
Company’s 2010 annual meeting of shareholders, the 2003 Plan
was amended to (i) increase the number of shares of the
Company’s common stock that may be delivered pursuant to
awards granted under the 2003 Plan by an additional 36,000,000
shares and (ii) extend the Company’s authority to grant
awards under the 2003 Plan intended to qualify as
“performance-based awards” within the meaning of
Section 162(m) of the U. S. Internal Revenue Code through the
2015 annual meeting of shareholders. As of September 25, 2010,
approximately 62.5 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Employee Stock
Option Plan

In
August 1997, the Company’s Board of Directors approved
the 1997 Employee Stock Option Plan (the “1997 Plan”),
a non-shareholder approved plan for grants of stock options to
employees who are not officers of the Company. Options granted
under the 1997 Plan generally expire seven to ten years after the
grant date. All stock options granted under the 1997 Plan are fully
vested. In October 2003, the Company terminated the 1997 Plan, and
no new options can be granted from this plan.

1997 Director Stock
Plan

In
August 1997, the Company’s Board of Directors (the
“ Board”) adopted a Director Stock Option Plan, which
was subsequently renamed the 1997 Director Stock Plan (the
“ Director Plan”) and has been approved by shareholders.
As amended, the Director Plan (i) permits the Company to grant
awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s non-employee
directors, (ii) beginning February 25, 2010, provides for
automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director
joining the Board and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each
annual meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board to
prospectively change the relative mixture of stock options and RSUs
for the initial and annual award grants and the methodology for
determining the number of shares of the Company’s common
stock subject to these grants without shareholder approval. Each
share issued with respect to RSUs granted under the plan reduces
the number of shares available for grant under the plan by two
shares. The Director Plan expires November 9, 2019. As of
September 25, 2010, approximately 199,000 shares were reserved
for future issuance under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading
Plans

During the
fourth quarter of 2010, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter
Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Philip W. Schiller and Bertrand
Serlet had trading plans pursuant to Rule 10b5-1(c)(1) of the
Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended (the “ Exchange
Act”). A trading plan is a written document that
pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or
sales of the Company’s stock including the exercise and sale
of employee stock options and shares acquired pursuant to the
Company’s employee stock purchase plan and upon vesting of
RSUs.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The Company has
a shareholder approved employee stock purchase plan (the
“ Purchase Plan”), under which substantially all
employees may purchase the Company’s common stock through
payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair
market values of the stock as of the beginning and end of six-month
offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s
compensation and employee’s may not purchase more than
$25,000 of stock for any calendar year. Additionally, no more than
1,000,000 shares may be purchased in the aggregate in any one
offering period. As of September 25, 2010, approximately
3.8 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the
Purchase Plan.

Employee Savings
Plan

The Company has
an employee savings plan (the “ Savings Plan”)
qualifying as a deferred salary arrangement under
Section 401(k) of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the Savings
Plan, participating U. S. employees may defer a portion of their
pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual contribution limit ($16,500
for calendar year 2010). The Company matches 50% to 100% of each
employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up
to a maximum 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings. The
Company’s matching contributions to the Savings Plan were $72
million, $59 million and $50 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.

the Company’s RSU activity and related information for the
three years ended September 25, 2010, is as follows (in

The fair value
as of the vesting date of RSUs was $1 billion, $221 million and
$320 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively. Upon vesting,
the RSUs are generally net share-settled to cover the required
withholding tax and the remaining amount is converted into an
equivalent number of shares of common stock. The majority of RSUs
that vested in 2010, 2009 and 2008, were net-share settled such
that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent to the
employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the applicable
income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash to the
appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were
approximately 1.8 million, 707,000 and 857,000 for 2010, 2009
and 2008, respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on
their vesting date as determined by the Company’s closing
stock price. Total payments for the employees’ tax
obligations to the taxing authorities were $406 million, $82
million and $124 million in 2010, 2009 and 2008, respectively, and
are reflected as a financing activity within the Consolidated
Statements of Cash Flows.  These net-share settlements had the
effect of share repurchases by the Company as they reduced and
retired the number of shares that would have otherwise been issued
as a result of the vesting and did not represent an expense to the
Company.

Aggregate
intrinsic value represents the value of the Company’s closing
stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess
of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of
options outstanding or exercisable. The aggregate intrinsic value
excludes the effect of stock options that have a zero or negative
intrinsic value. Total intrinsic value of options at time of
exercise was $2.0 billion, $827 million and $2.0 billion for 2010,
2009 and 2008, respectively.

RSUs granted
are deducted from the shares available for grant under the
Company’s stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times
the number of RSUs granted. Similarly, RSUs cancelled are added
back to the shares available for grant under the Company’s
stock option plans utilizing a factor of two times the number of
RSUs cancelled. Outstanding RSU balances are not included in the
outstanding options balances in the stock option activity
table.

Stock-Based
Compensation

Stock-based
compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant. Stock-based compensation cost for stock options and employee
stock purchase plan rights (“stock purchase rights”) is
estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based
on the fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model.
The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions
including expected volatility, expected life and interest
rates.  The expected volatility is based on the historical
volatility of the Company’s common stock over the most recent
period commensurate with the estimated expected life of the
Company’s stock options and other relevant factors including
implied volatility in market traded options on the Company’s
common stock. The Company bases its expected life assumption on its
historical experience and on the terms and conditions of the stock
awards it grants to employees. The Company recognizes stock-based
compensation cost as expense ratably on a straight-line basis over
the requisite service period.

The
weighted-average assumptions used for stock options granted do not
apply to employee stock options assumed in conjunction with
business acquisitions during the year ended September 25,
2010. The weighted-average fair value of stock options assumed
during the year ended September 25, 2010 was $216.82. There
were no stock options assumed during 2009 and 2008. The
weighted-average assumptions used for the three years ended
September 25, 2010, and the resulting estimates of
weighted-average fair value per share of options granted and of
stock purchase rights during those periods are as
follows:
