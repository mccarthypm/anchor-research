The Company had
net unrealized gains on its investment portfolio of $180 million
and $57 million as of September 25, 2010 and
September 26, 2009, respectively. The net unrealized gains as
of September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009 related
primarily to long-term marketable securities. The Company may sell
certain of its marketable securities prior to their stated
maturities for strategic purposes, in anticipation of credit
deterioration, or for duration management. The Company recognized
no significant net realized gains or losses during 2010, 2009 and
2008 related to such sales. The maturities of the Company’s
long-term marketable securities generally range from one year to
five years.

The Company
considers the declines in market value of its marketable securities
investment portfolio to be temporary in nature. The unrealized
losses on the Company’s marketable securities were caused
primarily by changes in market interest rates or widening credit
spreads. The Company typically invests in highly-rated securities,
and its policy generally limits the amount of credit exposure to
any one issuer. The Company’s investment policy requires
investments to be investment grade, primarily rated single-A or
better, with the objective of minimizing the potential risk of
principal loss. Fair values were determined for each individual
security in the investment portfolio. When evaluating the
investments for other-than-temporary impairment, the Company
reviews factors such as the length of time and extent to which fair
value has been below cost basis, the financial condition of the
issuer and any changes thereto, and the Company’s intent to
sell, or whether it is more likely than not it will be required to
sell, the investment before recovery of the investment’s
amortized cost basis. During the years ended September 25,
2010 and September 26, 2009, the Company did not recognize any
significant impairment charges. As of September 25, 2010, the
Company does not consider any of its investments to be
other-than-temporarily impaired.

Derivative Financial
Instruments

The Company
uses derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to
foreign currency exchange risk. The Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset some of the foreign
exchange risk of expected future cash flows on certain forecasted
revenue and cost of sales, of net investments in certain foreign
subsidiaries, and on certain existing assets and liabilities. To
help protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency
exchange rates, certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose
functional currency is the U. S. dollar, hedge a portion of
forecasted foreign currency revenue. The Company’s
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar and
who sell in local currencies, may hedge a portion of forecasted
inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’
functional currencies. The Company typically hedges portions of its
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and
inventory purchases for three to six months. To help protect the
net investment in a foreign operation from adverse changes in
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign
currency forward and option contracts to offset the changes in the
carrying amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in
foreign currency exchange rates. The Company may also enter into
foreign currency forward and option contracts to partially offset
the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by the
re-measurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in
non-functional currencies. However, the Company may choose not to
hedge certain foreign currency exchange exposures for a variety of
reasons, including but not limited to immateriality, accounting
considerations and the prohibitive economic cost of hedging
particular exposures. There can be no assurance the hedges will
offset more than a portion of the financial impact resulting from
movements in foreign currency exchange rates.

The
Company’s accounting policies for these instruments are based
on whether the instruments are designated as hedge or non-hedge
instruments. The Company records all derivatives on the
Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair value. The effective portions
of cash flow hedges are recorded in other comprehensive income
until the hedged item is recognized in earnings. The effective
portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other
comprehensive income as a part of the cumulative translation
adjustment. Derivatives that are not designated as hedging
instruments and the ineffective portions of cash flow hedges and
net investment hedges are adjusted to fair value through earnings
in other income and expense.

The Company had
a net deferred loss associated with cash flow hedges of
approximately $252 million and a net deferred gain of $1 million,
net of taxes, recorded in other comprehensive income as of
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009, respectively.
Other comprehensive income associated with cash flow hedges of
foreign currency revenue is recognized as a component of net sales
in the same period as the related revenue is recognized, and other
comprehensive income related to cash flow hedges of inventory
purchases is recognized as a component of cost of sales in the same
period as the related costs are recognized. Substantially all of
the Company’s hedged transactions as of September 25,
2010 are expected to occur within six months.

Derivative
instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will
not occur in the initially identified time period or within a
subsequent two month time period. Deferred gains and losses in
other comprehensive income associated with such derivative
instruments are reclassified immediately into earnings through
other income and expense. Any subsequent changes in fair value of
such derivative instruments also are reflected in current earnings
unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions. The
Company did not recognize any significant net gains or losses
related to the loss of hedge designation on discontinued cash flow
hedges during 2010, 2009 and 2008.

The Company had
an unrealized net loss on net investment hedges of $9 million and
$2 million, net of taxes, included in the cumulative translation
adjustment account of accumulated other comprehensive income
(“ AOCI”) as of September 25, 2010 and
September 26, 2009, respectively. The ineffective portions and
amounts excluded from the effectiveness test of net investment
hedges are recorded in current earnings in other income and
expense.

The Company
recognized in earnings a net loss of $123 million and $133 million
on foreign currency forward and option contracts not designated as
hedging instruments during the year ended September 25, 2010
and September 26, 2009, respectively. These amounts represent
the net gain or loss on the derivative contracts and do not include
changes in the related exposures, which generally offset a portion
of the gain or loss on the derivative contracts.

The following
table shows the notional principal and credit risk amounts of the
Company’s derivative instruments outstanding as of
September 25, 2010 and September 26, 2009 (in

The notional
principal amounts for derivative instruments provide one measure of
the transaction volume outstanding and does not represent the
amount of the Company’s exposure to credit or market loss.
The credit risk amounts represent the Company’s gross
exposure to potential accounting loss on these transactions if all
counterparties failed to perform according to the terms of the
contract, based on then-current currency exchange rates at each
respective date. The Company’s gross exposure on these
transactions may be further mitigated by collateral received from
certain counterparties. The Company’s exposure to credit loss
and market risk will vary over time as a function of currency
exchange rates. Although the table above reflects the notional
principal and credit risk amounts of the Company’s foreign
exchange instruments, it does not reflect the gains or losses
associated with the exposures and transactions that the foreign
exchange instruments are intended to hedge. The amounts ultimately
realized upon settlement of these financial instruments, together
with the gains and losses on the underlying exposures, will depend
on actual market conditions during the remaining life of the
instruments.

The Company
generally enters into master netting arrangements, which reduce
credit risk by permitting net settlement of transactions with the
same counterparty. To further limit credit risk, the Company
generally enters into collateral security arrangements that provide
for collateral to be received or posted when the net fair value of
certain financial instruments fluctuate from contractually
established thresholds. The Company presents its derivative assets
and derivative liabilities at their gross fair values.  As of
September 25, 2010, the Company has posted cash collateral
related to the derivative instruments under its collateral security
arrangements of $445 million and recorded the offsetting balance as
other current assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheet. The Company
did not record any significant amounts of cash collateral related
to the derivative instruments under its master netting arrangements
as of September 26, 2009. The Company did not have any
derivative instruments with credit risk-related contingent features
that would require it to post additional collateral as of
September 25, 2010 or September 26, 2009.

The estimates
of fair value are based on applicable and commonly used pricing
models and prevailing financial market information as of
September 25, 2010. Refer to Note 3, “ Fair Value
Measurements” of this Form 10-K, for additional information
on the fair value measurements for all financial assets and
liabilities, including derivative assets and derivative
liabilities, that are measured at fair value in the consolidated
financial statements on a recurring basis. The following tables

Accounts
Receivable

Trade
Receivables

The Company
distributes its products through third-party cellular network
carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added resellers and
directly to certain education, consumer and enterprise customers.
The Company generally does not require collateral from its
customers; however, the Company will require collateral in certain
instances to limit credit risk. In addition, when possible, the
Company attempts to limit credit risk on trade receivables with
credit insurance for certain customers in Latin America, Europe,
Asia, and Australia, or by requiring third-party financing, loans
or leases to support credit exposure. These credit-financing
arrangements are directly between the third-party financing company
and the end customer. As such, the Company generally does not
assume any recourse or credit risk sharing related to any of these
arrangements. However, considerable trade receivables not covered
by collateral, third-party financing arrangements, or credit
insurance are outstanding with the Company’s third-party
cellular network carriers, wholesalers, retailers and value-added
resellers. Trade receivables from two of the Company’s
customers accounted for 15% and 12% of trade receivables as of
September 25, 2010 and one of the Company’s customers
accounted for 16% of trade receivables as of September 26,
2009. The Company’s cellular network carriers accounted for
64% and 51% of trade receivables as of September 25, 2010 and
as of September 26, 2009, respectively. The additions and
write-offs to the Company’s allowance for doubtful accounts
during 2010, 2009 and 2008 were not significant.

Vendor Non-Trade
Receivables

The Company has
non-trade receivables from certain of its manufacturing vendors
resulting from the sale of components to these manufacturing
vendors who manufacture sub-assemblies or assemble final products
for the Company. The Company purchases these components directly
from suppliers. Vendor non-trade receivables from two of the
Company’s vendors accounted for 57% and 24%, respectively, of
non-trade receivables as of September 25, 2010 and two of the
Company’s vendors accounted for 40% and 36%, respectively, of
non-trade receivables as of September 26, 2009. The Company
does not reflect the sale of these components in net sales and does
not recognize any profits on these sales until the related products
are sold by the Company, at which time any profit is recognized as
a reduction of cost of sales.
