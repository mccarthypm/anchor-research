| **      Segment Information and Geographic Data** | Note 9 Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company
reports segment information based on the “management”
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting
used by management for making decisions and assessing performance
as the source of the Company’s reportable
segments.

The Company
manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly,
the Company determined its operating and reporting segments, which
are generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to
be the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail operations.
The Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific reportable segment
results do not include results of the Retail segment. The Americas
segment includes both North and South America. The Europe segment
includes European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa.
The Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asia, but does not
include Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in
11 countries, including the U. S. Each reportable operating segment
provides similar hardware and software products and similar
services. The accounting policies of the various segments are the
same as those described in Note 1, “ Summary of Significant
Accounting Policies.”

The Company
evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment
net sales are based on sales from the Company’s retail
stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to
third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are
generally included in the geographic segment in which the
expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed
outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment
operating income include various corporate expenses, such as
manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs,
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, stock-based
compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges,
and other separately managed general and administrative costs. The
Company does not include intercompany transfers between segments
for management reporting purposes. Segment assets exclude corporate
assets, such as cash, short-term and long-term investments,
manufacturing and corporate facilities, miscellaneous corporate
infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible assets.
Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for
long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment. Cash
payments for capital asset purchases by the Retail segment were
$392 million, $369 million and $389 million for 2010, 2009 and
2008, respectively.

The Company has
certain retail stores that have been designed and built to serve as
high-profile venues to promote brand awareness and serve as
vehicles for corporate sales and marketing activities. Because of
their unique design elements, locations and size, these stores
require substantially more investment than the Company’s more
typical retail stores. The Company allocates certain operating
expenses associated with its high-profile stores to corporate
marketing expense to reflect the estimated Company-wide benefit.
The allocation of these operating costs to corporate expense is
based on the amount incurred for a high-profile store in excess of
that incurred by a more typical Company retail location. The
Company had opened a total of 15 high-profile stores as of
September 25, 2010. Amounts allocated to corporate expense
resulting from the operations of high-profile stores were $75
million, $65 million and $53 million for 2010, 2009 and 2008,
respectively.
