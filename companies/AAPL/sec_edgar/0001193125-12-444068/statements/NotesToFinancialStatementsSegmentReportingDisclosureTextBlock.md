Information and Geographic Data

The Company
reports segment information based on the “management”
approach. The management approach designates the internal reporting
used by management for making decisions and assessing performance
as the source of the Company’s reportable
segments.

The Company
manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. Accordingly,
the Company determined its reportable operating segments, which are
generally based on the nature and location of its customers, to be
the Americas, Europe, Japan, Asia-Pacific and Retail. The results
of the Americas, Europe, Japan and Asia-Pacific segments do not
include results of the Retail segment. The Americas segment
includes both North and South America. The Europe segment includes
European countries, as well as the Middle East and Africa. The
Asia-Pacific segment includes Australia and Asian countries, other
than Japan. The Retail segment operates Apple retail stores in 13
countries, including the U. S. Each operating segment provides
similar hardware and software products and similar services. The
accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those
described in Note 1, “ Summary of Significant Accounting
Policies.”

The Company
evaluates the performance of its operating segments based on net
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are
generally based on the location of customers, while Retail segment
net sales are based on sales from the Company’s retail
stores. Operating income for each segment includes net sales to
third parties, related cost of sales and operating expenses
directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are
generally included in the geographic segment in which the
expenditures are incurred. Operating income for each segment
excludes other income and expense and certain expenses managed
outside the operating segments. Costs excluded from segment
operating income include various corporate expenses, such as
manufacturing costs and variances not included in standard costs,
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, share-based
compensation expense, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges,
and other separately managed general and administrative costs.
Prior to 2012, the Company allocated to corporate expenses certain
costs associated with its high-profile retail stores that have been
designed and built to promote brand awareness and serve as vehicles
for corporate sales and marketing activities. Beginning in 2012,
the Company no longer allocates these costs to corporate expenses
and reclassified $102 million and $75 million of such costs from
corporate to Retail segment expenses for 2011 and 2010,
respectively. The Company does not include intercompany transfers
between segments for management reporting purposes.

Segment assets
include receivables and inventories, and for the Retail segment
also includes capital assets. Segment assets exclude corporate
assets, such as cash and cash equivalents, short-term and long-term
marketable securities, vendor non-trade receivables, other
long-term investments, manufacturing and corporate facilities,
product tooling and manufacturing process equipment, miscellaneous
corporate infrastructure, goodwill and other acquired intangible
assets. Except for the Retail segment, capital asset purchases for
long-lived assets are not reported to management by segment and
therefore are excluded from the geographic segment assets and
instead included in corporate assets. Cash payments for capital
asset purchases by the Retail segment were $858 million, $612
million and $392 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
Company’s total depreciation and amortization was $3.3
billion, $1.8 billion and $1.0 billion in 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively, of which $319 million, $273 million and $198 million
was related to the Retail segment in the respective years.
Depreciation and amortization on segment assets included in the
geographic segments was not significant.
