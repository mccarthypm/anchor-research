Shareholders’ Equity and Share-based
Compensation

Preferred
Stock

The Company has
five million shares of authorized preferred stock, none of which is
issued or outstanding. Under the terms of the Company’s
Restated Articles of Incorporation, the Board of Directors is
authorized to determine or alter the rights, preferences,
privileges and restrictions of the Company’s authorized but
unissued shares of preferred stock.

Dividend and Stock
Repurchase Program

In 2012, the
Board of Directors of the Company approved a dividend policy
pursuant to which it plans to make, subject to subsequent
declaration, quarterly dividends of $2.65 per share. On
July 24, 2012, the Board of Directors declared a dividend of
$2.65 per share to shareholders of record as of the close of
business on August 13, 2012. The Company paid $2.5 billion in
conjunction with this dividend on August 16, 2012. No
dividends were declared in the first three quarters of 2012 or in
2011 and 2010.

In 2012, the
Company’s Board of Directors authorized a program to
repurchase up to $10 billion of the Company’s common stock
beginning in 2013. The repurchase program is expected to be
executed over a three-year period with the primary objective of
neutralizing the impact of dilution from future employee equity
grants and employee stock purchase programs.  The repurchase
program does not obligate the Company to acquire any specific
number of shares. In August 2012, the Company entered into a Rule
10b5-1 compliant accelerated share repurchase (“ ASR”)
program with a financial institution to purchase up to $2 billion
of the Company’s common stock during 2013. The total number
of shares to be purchased under the ASR program will be based on
the volume-weighted average price of the Company’s common
stock during the purchase period and will be reflected as a
reduction of shares outstanding on the date of purchase. The
Company may also purchase its common stock in open market
transactions, in compliance with all applicable securities
laws.

Comprehensive
Income

Comprehensive
income consists of two components, net income and other
comprehensive income. Other comprehensive income refers to revenue,
expenses, and gains and losses that under GAAP are recorded as an
element of shareholders’ equity but are excluded from net
income. The Company’s other comprehensive income consists of
foreign currency translation adjustments from those subsidiaries
not using the U. S. dollar as their functional currency, unrealized
gains and losses on marketable securities classified as
available-for-sale, and net deferred gains and losses on certain
derivative instruments accounted for as cash flow
hedges.

The following
table shows the components of AOCI, net of taxes, as of
September 29, 2012 and September 24, 2011 (in

Employee Benefit
Plans

2003 Employee Stock
Plan

The 2003
Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”) is a shareholder
approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to
employees, including executive officers. The 2003 Plan permits the
granting of incentive stock options, nonstatutory stock options,
RSUs, stock appreciation rights, stock purchase rights and
performance-based awards. Options granted under the 2003 Plan
generally expire seven to ten years after the grant date and
generally become exercisable over a period of four years, based on
continued employment, with either annual, semi-annual or quarterly
vesting. In general, RSUs granted under the 2003 Plan vest over two
to four years, based on continued employment and are settled upon
vesting in shares of the Company’s common stock on a
one-for-one basis. Each share issued with respect to an award
granted under the 2003 Plan (other than a stock option or stock
appreciation right) reduces the number of shares available for
grant under the plan by two shares, whereas shares issued in
respect of an option or stock appreciation right count against the
number of shares available for grant on a one-for-one basis. All
RSUs, other than RSUs held by the Chief Executive Officer, granted
under the 2003 Plan have dividend equivalent rights
(“ DER”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same
dividend value per share as holders of common stock. DER are
subject to the same vesting and other terms and conditions as the
corresponding unvested RSUs. DER are accumulated and paid when the
underlying shares vest. As of September 29, 2012,
approximately 37.1 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the 2003 Plan.

1997 Director Stock
Plan

The 1997
Director Stock Plan (the “ Director Plan”) is a
shareholder approved plan that (i) permits the Company to
grant awards of RSUs or stock options to the Company’s
non-employee directors, (ii) provides for automatic initial
grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board of
Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual
meeting of shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of
Directors to prospectively change the relative mixture of stock
options and RSUs for the initial and annual award grants and the
methodology for determining the number of shares of the
Company’s common stock subject to these grants without
shareholder approval. Each share issued with respect to RSUs
granted under the Director Plan reduces the number of shares
available for grant under the plan by two shares. The Director Plan
expires November 9, 2019. All RSUs granted under the Director
Plan are entitled to DER. As of September 29, 2012,
approximately 184,000 shares were reserved for future issuance
under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading
Plans

During the
fourth quarter of 2012, executive officers Timothy D. Cook, Peter
Oppenheimer, D. Bruce Sewell, Phillip W. Schiller and Jeffrey E.
Williams, and directors William V. Campbell and Arthur D. Levinson
had equity trading plans adopted in accordance with Rule
10b5-1(c)(1) under the Securities Exchange Act of 1934, as amended
(the “ Exchange Act”). An equity trading plan is a
written document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates
(or a formula for determining the amounts, prices and dates) of
future purchases or sales of the Company’s stock, including
shares acquired pursuant to the Company’s employee and
director equity plans.

Employee Stock Purchase
Plan

The Employee
Stock Purchase Plan (the “ Purchase Plan”) is a
shareholder approved plan under which substantially all employees
may purchase the Company’s common stock through payroll
deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the fair market
values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month
offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the
Purchase Plan are limited to 10% of the employee’s
compensation and employees may not purchase more than $25,000 of
stock during any calendar year. As of September 29, 2012,
approximately 2.5 million shares were reserved for future
issuance under the Purchase Plan.

401(k)
Plan

The
Company’s 401(k) Plan (the “401(k) Plan”) is a
deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) of the
Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U. S.
employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the
IRS annual contribution limit ($17,000 for calendar year 2012). The
Company matches 50% to 100% of each employee’s contributions,
depending on length of service, up to a maximum 6% of the
employee’s eligible earnings. The Company’s matching
contributions to the 401(k) Plan were $114 million, $90 million and
$72 million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

  Balance at              15,005        $344.87  

The fair value
as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $3.3 billion, $1.5
billion and $1.0 billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
majority of RSUs that vested in 2012, 2011 and 2010 were net-share
settled such that the Company withheld shares with value equivalent
to the employees’ minimum statutory obligation for the
applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted the cash
to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld
were approximately 2.3 million, 1.6 million and
1.8 million for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and were
based on the value of the RSUs on their respective vesting dates as
determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total
payments for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing
authorities were $1.2 billion, $520 million and $406 million in
2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively, and are reflected as a financing
activity within the Consolidated Statements of Cash
Flows.  These net-share settlements had the effect of share
repurchases by the Company as they reduced and retired the number
of shares that would have otherwise been issued as a result of the
vesting and did not represent an expense to the Company.

Aggregate
intrinsic value represents the value of the Company’s closing
stock price on the last trading day of the fiscal period in excess
of the weighted-average exercise price multiplied by the number of
options outstanding or exercisable. Total intrinsic value of
options at time of exercise was $2.3 billion, $2.6 billion and $2.0
billion for 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively.

Share-based
Compensation

Share-based
compensation cost for RSUs is measured based on the closing fair
market value of the Company’s common stock on the date of
grant. Share-based compensation cost for stock options and employee
stock purchase plan rights (“stock purchase rights”) is
estimated at the grant date and offering date, respectively, based
on the fair-value as calculated by the BSM option-pricing model.
The BSM option-pricing model incorporates various assumptions
including expected volatility, estimated expected life and interest
rates.  The Company recognizes share-based compensation cost as
expense on a straight-line basis over the requisite service
period.

The Company did
not grant any stock options during 2012. The Company granted 1,370
and 34,000 stock options during 2011 and 2010, respectively. The
weighted-average grant date fair value per share of stock options
granted during 2011 and 2010 was $181.13 and $108.58,
respectively.

During 2012 and
2010, in conjunction with certain business combinations, the
Company assumed 41,000 and 98,000 stock options, respectively,
which had a weighted-average fair value per share of $405.39 and
$216.82, respectively. The Company did not assume any stock options
during 2011.

The
weighted-average fair value of stock purchase rights per share was
$108.44, $71.47 and $45.03 during 2012, 2011 and 2010,
respectively.

The following
table shows a summary of the share-based compensation expense
included in the Consolidated Statements of Operations for 2012,
2011, and 2010 (in millions):

The income tax
benefit related to share-based compensation expense was $567
million, $467 million and $314 million for 2012, 2011 and
2010, respectively. As of September 29, 2012, the total
unrecognized compensation cost related to outstanding stock options
and RSUs was $4.2 billion, which the Company expects to recognize
over a weighted-average period of 3.3 years.
