Accrued Warranty and
Indemnification

The Company
offers a basic limited parts and labor warranty on its hardware
products. The basic warranty period for hardware products is
typically one year from the date of purchase by the end-user. The
Company also offers a 90-day basic warranty for its service parts
used to repair the Company’s hardware products. The Company
provides currently for the estimated cost that may be incurred
under its basic limited product warranties at the time related
revenue is recognized. Factors considered in determining
appropriate accruals for product warranty obligations include the
size of the installed base of products subject to warranty
protection, historical and projected warranty claim rates,
historical and projected cost-per-claim, and knowledge of specific
product failures that are outside of the Company’s typical
experience. The Company assesses the adequacy of its pre-existing
warranty liabilities and adjusts the amounts as necessary based on
actual experience and changes in future estimates.

The following
table shows changes in the Company’s accrued warranties and
related costs for 2012, 2011, and 2010 (in millions):

The Company
generally does not indemnify end-users of its operating system and
application software against legal claims that the software
infringes third-party intellectual property rights. Other
agreements entered into by the Company sometimes include
indemnification provisions under which the Company could be subject
to costs and/or damages in the event of an infringement claim
against the Company or an indemnified third-party. However, the
Company has not been required to make any significant payments
resulting from such an infringement claim asserted against it or an
indemnified third-party and, in the opinion of management, does not
have a potential liability related to unresolved infringement
claims subject to indemnification that would materially adversely
affect its financial condition or operating results. Therefore, the
Company did not record a liability for infringement costs related
to indemnification as of either September 29, 2012 or
September 24, 2011.

The Company has
entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and
executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed
to indemnify such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by
law against liabilities that arise by reason of their status as
directors or officers and to advance expenses incurred by such
individuals in connection with related legal proceedings. It is not
possible to determine the maximum potential amount of payments the
Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique
facts and circumstances involved in each claim. However, the
Company maintains directors and officers liability insurance
coverage to reduce its exposure to such obligations, and payments
made under these agreements historically have not been
material.

Concentrations in the
Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most
components essential to the Company’s business are generally
available from multiple sources, a number of components are
currently obtained from single or limited sources, which subjects
the Company to significant supply and pricing risks. Many
components, including those that are available from multiple
sources, are at times subject to industry-wide shortages and
significant commodity pricing fluctuations. In addition, the
Company has entered into various agreements for the supply of
components; however there can be no guarantee that the Company will
be able to extend or renew these agreements on similar terms, or at
all. Therefore, the Company remains subject to significant risks of
supply shortages and price increases that can materially adversely
affect its financial condition and operating results.

The Company and
other participants in the markets for mobile communication and
media devices and personal computers also compete for various
components with other industries that have experienced increased
demand for their products. The Company also uses some custom
components that are not common to the rest of these industries, and
new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom
components available from only one source. When a component or
product uses new technologies, initial capacity constraints may
exist until the suppliers’ yields have matured or
manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply
of components for a new or existing product were delayed or
constrained, or if an outsourcing partner delayed shipments of
completed products to the Company, the Company’s financial
condition and operating results could be materially adversely
affected. The Company’s business and financial performance
could also be materially adversely affected depending on the time
required to obtain sufficient quantities from the original source,
or to identify and obtain sufficient quantities from an alternative
source. Continued availability of these components at acceptable
prices, or at all, may be affected if those suppliers concentrated
on the production of common components instead of components
customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

Substantially
all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia. A
significant concentration of this manufacturing is currently
performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, often in
single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are the
sole-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of
the Company’s products. Although the Company works closely
with its outsourcing partners on manufacturing schedules, the
Company’s operating results could be adversely affected if
its outsourcing partners were unable to meet their production
commitments. The Company’s purchase commitments typically
cover its requirements for periods up to 150 days.

Long-Term Supply
Agreements

The Company has
entered into long-term agreements to secure the supply of certain
inventory components. Under certain of these agreements, which
expire between 2012 and 2022, the Company has made prepayments for
the future purchase of inventory components and has acquired
capital equipment to use in the manufacturing of such
components.

As of
September 29, 2012, the Company had a total of $4.2 billion of
inventory component prepayments outstanding, of which $1.2 billion
are classified as other current assets and $3.0 billion are
classified as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. The
Company had a total of $2.3 billion of inventory component
prepayments outstanding as of September 24, 2011. The
Company’s outstanding prepayments will be applied to certain
inventory component purchases made during the term of each
respective agreement. The Company utilized $943 million and $173
million of inventory component prepayments during 2012 and 2011,
respectively.

Other Off-Balance Sheet
Commitments

Lease
Commitments

The Company
leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space,
under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does
not currently utilize any other off-balance sheet financing
arrangements. The major facility leases are typically for terms not
exceeding 10 years and generally provide renewal options for terms
not exceeding five additional years. Leases for retail space are
for terms ranging from five to 20 years, the majority of which are
for 10 years, and often contain multi-year renewal options. As of
September 29, 2012, the Company’s total future minimum
lease payments under noncancelable operating leases were $4.4
billion, of which $3.1 billion related to leases for retail
space.

Rent expense
under all operating leases, including both cancelable and
noncancelable leases, was $488 million, $338 million and $271
million in 2012, 2011 and 2010, respectively. Future minimum lease
payments under noncancelable operating leases having remaining
terms in excess of one year as of September 29, 2012, are as
follows (in millions):

                 2013        516  
                 2014        556  
                 2015        542  
                 2016        513  
                 2017        486  
           Thereafter      1,801  
  Total minimum lease      4,414  

Other
Commitments

As of
September 29, 2012, the Company had outstanding off-balance
sheet third-party manufacturing commitments and component purchase
commitments of $21.1 billion.

In addition to
the off-balance sheet commitments mentioned above, the Company had
outstanding obligations of $988 million as of September 29,
2012, which were comprised mainly of commitments to acquire capital
assets, including product tooling and manufacturing process
equipment, and commitments related to advertising, research and
development, Internet and telecommunications services and other
obligations.

Contingencies

The Company is
subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen in
the ordinary course of business and have not been fully
adjudicated, certain of which are discussed in Part I, Item 3
of this Form 10-K under the heading “ Legal
Proceedings” and in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K
under the heading “ Risk Factors.” In the opinion of
management, there was not at least a reasonable possibility the
Company may have incurred a material loss, or a material loss in
excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss contingencies.
However, the outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain.
Therefore, although management considers the likelihood of such an
outcome to be remote, if one or more of these legal matters were
resolved against the Company in a reporting period for amounts in
excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s
consolidated financial statements for that reporting period could
be materially adversely affected.

Apple Inc. vs Samsung
Electronics Co., Ltd, et al.

On
August 24, 2012, a jury returned a verdict awarding the
Company $1.05 billion in its lawsuit against Samsung Electronics
and affiliated parties in the United States District Court,
Northern District of California, San Jose Division. Because the
award is subject to entry of final judgment and may be subject
to appeal, the Company has not recognized the award in its
consolidated financial statements for the year ended  September
29, 2012.
