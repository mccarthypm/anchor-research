fixed-rate notes, the Company uses interest rate swaps to effectively convert 
the fixed interest rates to floating interest rates on a portion of these notes.
Additionally, to manage foreign exchange rate risk on certain of its foreign 
currency - denominated notes, the Company uses cross-currency swaps to 
effectively convert these notes to U. S. dollar - denominated notes.

The effective interest rates for the Notes include the interest on the Notes, 
amortization of the discount or premium and, if applicable, adjustments related 
to hedging. The Company recognized $3.7 billion, $2.8 billion and $2.6 billion
