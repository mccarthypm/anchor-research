The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries. The preparation of these consolidated financial 
statements and accompanying notes in conformity with GAAP requires the use of 
management estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial
statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the 
current period’s presentation.

|   Fiscal Period | The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters, which occurred in the first fiscal quarter of 2023. The Company’s fiscal year 2023 spanned 53 weeks, whereas fiscal years 2022 and 2021 spanned 52 weeks each. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. |
| **  Revenue** | Revenue

The Company records revenue net of taxes collected from customers that are 
remitted to governmental authorities.

The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled 
when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. 
Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment
and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or 
services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products 
net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s 
Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. 
Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period 
following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as 
applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product 
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the 
Company’s expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises
within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all 
distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling 
prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine
SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that 
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the 
performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone 
basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices 
considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and 
circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where 
applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends 
in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and 
the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly 
included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain 
other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the 
substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled 
software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the
right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include 
iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to 
receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades 
relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue
and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their 
relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered 
performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s 
estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software
is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally 
occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related 
bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected 
to be provided.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance 
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the 
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company 
has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of 
the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, 
and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the 
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue 
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple 
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, 
including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains 
inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring 
acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App 
Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it
to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application
- related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the 
commission it retains.
 |
| **  Share-Based Compensation** | Share-Based Compensation

The Company recognizes share-based compensation expense on a straight-line basis
for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately vest.
 |
| **  Cash Equivalents** | Cash Equivalents

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are treated as cash equivalents.
 |
|   Marketable Securities | Marketable Securities

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies marketable debt 
securities as either current or non-current based solely on each instrument’s 
underlying contractual maturity date.
 |
| **  Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.
 |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line 
basis.
 |
| **  Derivative Instruments** | Derivative Instruments

The Company presents derivative assets and liabilities at their gross fair 
values in the Consolidated Balance Sheets.

The Company classifies cash flows related to derivative instruments in the same 
section of the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows as the items being hedged, 
which are generally classified as operating activities.
 |
| **  Income Taxes** | Income Taxes

The Company records certain deferred tax assets and liabilities in connection 
with the minimum tax on certain foreign earnings created by the Act.
 |
| **  Leases** | Leases

The Company combines and accounts for lease and nonlease components as a single 
lease component for leases of corporate, data center and retail facilities.

The discount rates related to the Company’s lease liabilities are generally 
based on estimates of the Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount 
rates implicit in the Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.
 |
| **  Fair Value Measurements** | The valuation techniques used to measure the fair values of the Company’s Level 2 financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data. |
| **  Segment Reporting** | The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and 
Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. 
Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia 
Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the 
Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide 
similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed
separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and 
distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net 
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally 
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores
located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment 
consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating 
expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the 
Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and 
assessing segment performance excludes asset information.
