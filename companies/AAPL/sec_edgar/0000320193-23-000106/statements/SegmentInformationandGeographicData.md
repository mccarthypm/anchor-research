The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and 
Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. 
Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia 
Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the 
Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide 
similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed
separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and 
distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region.

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net 
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally 
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores
located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment 
consists of net sales to third parties, related cost of sales, and operating 
expenses directly attributable to the segment. The information provided to the 
Company’s chief operating decision maker for purposes of making decisions and 
assessing segment performance excludes asset information.

The following table shows information by reportable segment for 2023, 2022 and 
2021 (in millions):
