The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, 
including corporate, data center, manufacturing and retail space. These leases 
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain 
multiyear renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise.

Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and 
variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the 
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the 
Company’s operating leases were $2.0 billion, $1.9 billion and $1.7 billion for 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. Lease costs associated with variable payments
on the Company’s leases were $13.9 billion, $14.9 billion and $12.9 billion for 
2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.

The Company made $1.9 billion, $1.8 billion and $1.4 billion of fixed cash 
payments related to operating leases in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. 
Noncash activities involving right-of-use (“ROU”) assets obtained in exchange 
for lease liabilities were $2.1 billion, $2.8 billion and $3.3 billion for 2023,
2022 and 2021, respectively.

The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated 
financial statement line items, as of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022

additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had
not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2024 and 2026, with lease
