The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects to be entitled 
when control of the products or services is transferred to its customers. 
Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right to payment
and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of products or 
services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s Products 
net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the Company’s 
Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are delivered. 
Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a short period 
following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of services, as 
applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product 
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the 
Company’s expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises
within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all 
distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling 
prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine
SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that 
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the 
performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone 
basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices 
considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and 
circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where 
applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends 
in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and 
the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly 
included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain 
other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the 
substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled 
software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the
right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include 
iCloud®, Siri® and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to 
receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades 
relating to the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue
and any related discounts to these performance obligations based on their 
relative SSPs. Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered 
performance obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s 
estimated SSPs. Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software
is recognized when control has transferred to the customer, which generally 
occurs when the product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related 
bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected 
to be provided.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance 
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the 
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company 
has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of 
the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, 
and does not disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the 
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue 
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple 
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products, 
including evaluating if it can establish the price of the product, retains 
inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility for ensuring 
acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold through the App 
Store, the Company does not obtain control of the product before transferring it
to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for all third-party application
- related sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the 
commission it retains.

Net sales disaggregated by significant products and services for 2023, 2022 and 
2021 were as follows (in millions):

(1) Products net sales include amortization of the deferred value of unspecified
software upgrade rights, which are bundled in the sales price of the respective 
product.

(2) Services net sales include amortization of the deferred value of services 
bundled in the sales price of certain products.

Total net sales include $8.2 billion of revenue recognized in 2023 that was 
included in deferred revenue as of September 24, 2022, $7.5 billion of revenue 
recognized in 2022 that was included in deferred revenue as of September 25, 
2021, and $6.7 billion of revenue recognized in 2021 that was included in 
deferred revenue as of September 26, 2020.

The Company’s proportion of net sales by disaggregated revenue source was 
generally consistent for each reportable segment in Note 13, “Segment 
Information and Geographic Data” for 2023, 2022 and 2021, except in Greater 
China, where iPhone revenue represented a moderately higher proportion of net 
sales.

As of September 30, 2023 and September 24, 2022, the Company had total deferred 
revenue of $12.1 billion and $12.4 billion, respectively. As of September 30, 
2023, the Company expects 67% of total deferred revenue to be realized in less 
than a year, 25% within one-to-two years, 7% within two-to-three years and 1% in
greater than three years.
