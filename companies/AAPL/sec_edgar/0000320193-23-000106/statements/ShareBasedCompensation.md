2022 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. 2022 Employee Stock Plan (the “2022 Plan”) is a 
shareholder-approved plan that provides for broad-based equity grants to 
employees, including executive officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock
grants, performance-based awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights. 
RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan generally vest over four years, based on 
continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s 
common stock on a one-for-one basis. All RSUs granted under the 2022 Plan have 
dividend equivalent rights, which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend 
value per share as holders of common stock. A maximum of approximately 1.3 
billion shares were authorized for issuance pursuant to 2022 Plan awards at the 
time the plan was approved on March 4, 2022.

2014 Employee Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. 2014 Employee Stock Plan (the “2014 Plan”) is a 
shareholder-approved plan that provided for broad-based equity grants to 
employees, including executive officers. The 2014 Plan permitted the granting of
substantially the same types of equity awards with substantially the same terms 
as the 2022 Plan. The 2014 Plan also permitted the granting of cash bonus 
awards. In the third quarter of 2022, the Company terminated the authority to 
grant new awards under the 2014 Plan.

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $15.9 billion, 
$18.2 billion and $19.0 billion for 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively. The 
majority of RSUs that vested in 2023, 2022 and 2021 were net share settled such 
that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ 
obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted 
the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were 
approximately 37 million, 41 million and 53 million for 2023, 2022 and 2021, 
respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective 
vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments
to taxing authorities for employees’ tax obligations were $5.6 billion, $6.4 
billion and $6.8 billion in 2023, 2022 and 2021, respectively.
