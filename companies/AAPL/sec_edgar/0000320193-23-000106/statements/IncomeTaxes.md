As of September 30, 2023, the Company had $5.2 billion in foreign tax credit 
carryforwards in Ireland and $3.0 billion in California R& D credit 
carryforwards, both of which can be carried forward indefinitely. A valuation 
allowance has been recorded for the credit carryforwards and a portion of other 
temporary differences.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of September 30, 2023, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits 
was $19.5 billion, of which $9.5 billion, if recognized, would impact the 
Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 24, 2022, the total amount of 
gross unrecognized tax benefits was $16.8 billion, of which $8.0 billion, if 
recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which 
excludes interest and penalties, for 2023, 2022 and 2021, is as follows (in 
millions):

                                                                        2023

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S. 
federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisd ictions. Tax years after 
2017 for the U. S. federal jurisdiction, and after 2014 in certain major foreign
jurisdictions, remain subject to examination. Altho ugh the timing of resolution
or closure of examinations is not certain, the Company believes it is reasonably
possible that its gross unrecognized tax benefits could decrease in the next 12 
months by as much as $4.5 billion.

European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland 
granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 
concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two 
subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision 
ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for 
the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective
as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that 
date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus 
interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid 
Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the
“General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid 
Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General 
Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice (the “ECJ”) and a hearing was 
held on May 23, 2023. A decision from the ECJ is expected in calendar year 2024.
The Company believes it would be eligible to claim a U. S. foreign tax credit 
for a portion of any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due 
related to the State Aid Decision.

On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for
Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries.
As of September 30, 2023, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.7 billion, 
excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into 
escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion 
of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable 
Securities section of Note 4, “Financial Instruments” for more information.
