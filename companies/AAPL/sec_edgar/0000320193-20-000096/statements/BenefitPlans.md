2014 Employee Stock Plan

In the second quarter of 2014, shareholders approved the 2014 Employee Stock 
Plan (the “2014 Plan”) and terminated the Company’s authority to grant new 
awards under the 2003 Employee Stock Plan (the “2003 Plan”). The 2014 Plan 
provides for broad-based equity grants to employees, including executive 
officers, and permits the granting of RSUs, stock grants, performance-based 
awards, stock options and stock appreciation rights, as well as cash bonus 
awards. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan generally vest over four years, based 
on continued employment, and are settled upon vesting in shares of the Company’s
common stock on a one-for-one basis. RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan reduce the
number of shares available for grant under the plan by a factor of two times the
number of RSUs granted. RSUs canceled and shares withheld to satisfy tax 
withholding obligations increase the number of shares available for grant under 
the 2014 Plan utilizing a factor of two times the number of RSUs canceled or 
shares withheld. Currently, all RSUs granted under the 2014 Plan have dividend 
equivalent rights (“DERs”), which entitle holders of RSUs to the same dividend 
value per share as holders of common stock. DERs are subject to the same vesting
and other terms and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are 
accumulated and paid when the underlying shares vest. Upon approval of the 2014 
Plan, the Company reserved 1.54 billion shares plus the number of shares 
remaining that were reserved but not issued under the 2003 Plan. Shares subject 
to outstanding awards under the 2003 Plan that expire, are canceled or otherwise
terminate, or are withheld to satisfy tax withholding obligations for RSUs, will
also be available for awards under the 2014 Plan. As of September 26, 2020, 
approximately 808 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 
2014 Plan.

Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan

The Apple Inc. Non-Employee Director Stock Plan (the “Director Plan”) is a 
shareholder-approved plan that (i) permits the Company to grant awards of RSUs 
or stock options to the Company’s non-employee directors, (ii) provides for 
automatic initial grants of RSUs upon a non-employee director joining the Board 
of Directors and automatic annual grants of RSUs at each annual meeting of 
shareholders, and (iii) permits the Board of Directors to prospectively change 
the value and relative mixture of stock options and RSUs for the initial and 
annual award grants and the methodology for determining the number of shares of 
the Company’s common stock subject to these grants, in each case within the 
limits set forth in the Director Plan and without further shareholder approval. 
RSUs granted under the Director Plan reduce the number of shares available for 
grant under the plan by a factor of two times the number of RSUs granted. The 
Director Plan expires on November 12, 2027. All RSUs granted under the Director 
Plan are entitled to DERs. DERs are subject to the same vesting and other terms 
and conditions as the corresponding unvested RSUs. DERs are accumulated and paid
when the underlying shares vest. As of September 26, 2020, approximately 4 
million shares were reserved for future issuance under the Director Plan.

Rule 10b5-1 Trading Plans

During the three months ended September 26, 2020, Section 16 officers Katherine 
L. Adams, Timothy D. Cook, Chris Kondo, Luca Maestri, Deirdre O’Brien and 
Jeffrey Williams had equity trading plans in place in accordance with Rule 
10b5-1(c)(1) under the Exchange Act. An equity trading plan is a written 
document that pre-establishes the amounts, prices and dates (or formula for 
determining the amounts, prices and dates) of future purchases or sales of the 
Company’s stock, including shares acquired under the Company’s employee and 
director equity plans.

Employee Stock Purchase Plan

The Employee Stock Purchase Plan (the “Purchase Plan”) is a shareholder-approved
plan under which substantially all employees may purchase the Company’s common 
stock through payroll deductions at a price equal to 85% of the lower of the 
fair market values of the stock as of the beginning or the end of six-month 
offering periods. An employee’s payroll deductions under the Purchase Plan are 
limited to 10% of the employee’s compensation and employees may not purchase 
more than $25,000 of stock during any calendar year. As of September 26, 2020, 
approximately 107 million shares were reserved for future issuance under the 
Purchase Plan.

401(k) Plan

The Company’s 401(k) Plan is a deferred salary arrangement under Section 401(k) 
of the Internal Revenue Code. Under the 401(k) Plan, participating U. S. 
employees may defer a portion of their pre-tax earnings, up to the IRS annual 
contribution limit ($19,500 for calendar year 2020). The Company matches 50% to 
100% of each employee’s contributions, depending on length of service, up to a 
maximum of 6% of the employee’s eligible earnings.

The fair value as of the respective vesting dates of RSUs was $10.8 billion, 
$8.6 billion and $7.6 billion for 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively. The 
majority of RSUs that vested in 2020, 2019 and 2018 were net share settled such 
that the Company withheld shares with a value equivalent to the employees’ 
obligation for the applicable income and other employment taxes, and remitted 
the cash to the appropriate taxing authorities. The total shares withheld were 
approximately 56 million, 59 million and 64 million for 2020, 2019 and 2018, 
respectively, and were based on the value of the RSUs on their respective 
vesting dates as determined by the Company’s closing stock price. Total payments
for the employees’ tax obligations to taxing authorities were $3.9 billion, $3.0
billion and $2.7 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, respectively.
