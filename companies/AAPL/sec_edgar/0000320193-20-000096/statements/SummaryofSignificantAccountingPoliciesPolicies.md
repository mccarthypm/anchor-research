| **  Basis of Presentation and Preparation** | Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s 
management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which
are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement 
presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s 
presentation.
 |
|   Fiscal Period | The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52 weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years. |
| **  Common Stock Split** | Common Stock Split

On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to 
shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit 
(“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to 
reflect the stock split.

| **  Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements** | Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Leases

At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)(“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to 
clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases 
standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency
and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases
and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted 
the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, 
under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts 
existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) 
whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial 
direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion of right-of-use 
(“ROU”) assets and $8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Hedging

At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 
2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to 
Accounting for Hedging Activities(“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component 
and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging 
instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge 
ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The 
Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition 
method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase in 
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding 
decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of 
Shareholders’ Equity.
 |
| **  Advertising Costs** | Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.
 |
| **  Share-Based Compensation** | Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense
on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately 
vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”
 |
| **  Earnings Per Share** | The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect of potentially dilutive securities. |
| **  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities** | Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt 
securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s 
underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).

The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based 
on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current 
operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair 
value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI& E”).

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.
 |
| **  Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.
 |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and EquipmentDepreciation on property, plant and equipment is 
recognized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets, which for buildings is the lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of 
the building; between

one

and five years for machinery and equipment, including product tooling and 
manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful life 
for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use software 
are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of the 
assets, which range from

three

to seven years.
 |
| **  Non-Marketable Securities** | Non-Marketable Securities

The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity 
securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s 
non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and 
are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions 
for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on 
non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI& E.
 |
| **  Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities** | Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities

The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when 
withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted 
cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current 
or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.
The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current 
marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the 
classification of the underlying securities.
 |
| **  Fair Value Measurements** | Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable 
equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s
debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have 
counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or 
model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.

Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities. Level 2 fair value estimates are based on 
observable inputs other than quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets and liabilities, quoted prices for identical or similar assets or 
liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs that are observable or can be 
corroborated by observable market data for substantially the full term of the 
assets or liabilities.
 |
| **  Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and 
other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects
to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its 
customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right
to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s
Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the 
Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are 
delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a 
short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of 
services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product 
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the 
Company’s expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises
within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all 
distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling 
prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine
SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that 
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the 
performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone 
basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices 
considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and 
circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where 
applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends 
in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and 
the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly 
included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain 
other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the 
substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled 
software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the
right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud,
Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a 
when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to 
the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any 
related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance 
obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.
Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized 
when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the 
product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services 
and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. 
Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including 
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to 
provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights
are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance 
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the 
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company 
has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of 
the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, 
and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the 
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue 
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple 
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products 
including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the 
product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility 
for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold 
through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s 
other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product
before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such
sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it
retains.

The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers 
that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded
within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government 
authority.
 |
| **  Derivative Financial Instruments** | Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to 
foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and 
liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for 
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or
the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no 
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact 
resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, 
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U. S. 
dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar may hedge a 
portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ 
functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option 
contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these 
instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its 
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory 
purchases, typically for up to 12 months.

To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency 
forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying 
amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, 
such as its foreign currency - denominated debt, as hedges of its net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company
designates these instruments as net investment hedges.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may
enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These 
instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or 
losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as
either cash flow or fair value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s 
hedged term debt - and marketable securities - related foreign currency 
transactions are expected to be recognized within 22 years.

The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to 
offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by 
the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in 
non-functional currencies.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into 
interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset 
a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair 
value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair 
value hedges. As of September 26, 2020, the Company’s hedged interest rate 
transactions are expected to be recognized within seven years.

Cash Flow Hedges

Cash flow hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness are deferred in AOCI until the hedged item is recognized in 
earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign 
currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period 
as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to 
cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of
sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and
losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are 
recognized in OI& E in the same period as the related income or expense is 
recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, the time value is 
excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in the 
financial statement line item to which the hedge relates on a straight-line 
basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded 
from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as 
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in 
the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time 
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative 
instruments are reclassified into OI& E in the period of de-designation. Any 
subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative instruments are reflected in
OI& E unless they are re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

Net investment hedge amounts that are included in the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness are recorded in OCI as a part of the cumulative translation 
adjustment. For foreign exchange forward contracts designated as net investment 
hedges, the forward carry component is excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and recognized in OCI on a straight-line basis over the life of 
the hedge. Changes in the fair value of amounts excluded from the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness are recognized in OCI.

Fair Value Hedges

Fair value hedge gains and losses related to amounts that are included in the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in earnings along with a 
corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value of the hedged item in 
the same line in the Consolidated Statements of Operations. For foreign exchange
forward contracts designated as fair value hedges, the forward carry component 
is excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognized in OI& E 
on a straight-line basis over the life of the hedge. Changes in the fair value 
of amounts excluded from the assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in
OCI.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the 
derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair 
value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is 
based on its hedge designation. The Company classifies cash flows related to 
derivative financial instruments as operating activities in its Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows.

| **  Income Taxes** | The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and liabilities.The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within the provision for income taxes. |
| **  Segment Reporting** | The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The 
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for 
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s 
reportable segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and 
Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. 
Greater China includes China mainland, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia 
Pacific includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the 
Company’s other reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide 
similar hardware and software products and similar services, each one is managed
separately to better align with the location of the Company’s customers and 
distribution partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. 
The accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described 
in Note 1, “Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net 
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally 
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores
located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment 
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating 
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are 
generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are 
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense 
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded 
from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as 
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based 
compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other 
separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not 
include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting 
purposes.

| **  Leases** | The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, corporate, and data center facilities. |
