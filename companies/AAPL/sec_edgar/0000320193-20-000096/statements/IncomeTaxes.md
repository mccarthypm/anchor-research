U. S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the U. S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “Act”), 
which significantly changed U. S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U. S. 
statutory federal income tax rate from 35% to 21% effective January 1, 2018, 
while also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign 
income. The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain foreign earnings, for 
which the Company has elected to record certain deferred tax assets and 
liabilities.

Provision for Income Taxes and Effective Tax Rate

The provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and 2018, consisted of the 
following (in millions):

The foreign provision for income taxes is based on foreign pre-tax earnings of 
$38.1 billion, $44.3 billion and $48.0 billion in 2020, 2019 and 2018, 
respectively.

A reconciliation of the provision for income taxes, with the amount computed by 
applying the statutory federal income tax rate (21% in 2020 and 2019; 24.5% in 
2018) to income before provision for income taxes for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as
follows (dollars in millions):

Deferred Tax Assets and Liabilities

As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019, the significant components of

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax credits and the 
future income tax effects of temporary differences between the consolidated 
financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and 
their respective tax bases, and are measured using enacted tax rates that apply 
to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected
to be recovered or settled.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As of September 26, 2020, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits 
was $16.5 billion, of which $8.8 billion, if recognized, would impact the 
Company’s effective tax rate. As of September 28, 2019, the total amount of 
gross unrecognized tax benefits was $15.6 billion, of which $8.6 billion, if 
recognized, would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate change in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which 
excludes interest and penalties, for 2020, 2019 and 2018, is as follows (in 
millions):

                                                                        2020

16,475      $          15,619      $            9,694  

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S. 
federal jurisdiction and many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U. S. 
Internal Revenue Service (the “IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 
through 2015 in 2018, and all years before 2016 are closed. Tax years after 2014
remain open in certain major foreign jurisdictions and are subject to 
examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate 
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with 
certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a
manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to 
adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
Although the timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the 
Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax 
benefits could decrease in the next 12 months by as much as $3.9 billion.

Interest and Penalties

The Company includes interest and penalties related to income tax matters within
the provision for income taxes. As of September 26, 2020 and September 28, 2019,
the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was $1.4 billion and 
$1.3 billion, respectively. The Company recognized interest and penalty expense 
in 2020, 2019 and 2018 of $85 million, $73 million and $489 million, 
respectively.

European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland 
granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 
concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches of two 
subsidiaries of the Company (the “State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision 
ordered Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for 
the period June 2003 through December 2014. Irish legislative changes, effective
as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions from that 
date forward. The recovery amount was calculated to be €13.1 billion, plus 
interest of €1.2 billion. The Company and Ireland appealed the State Aid 
Decision to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the European Union (the
“General Court”). On July 15, 2020, the General Court annulled the State Aid 
Decision. On September 25, 2020, the European Commission appealed the General 
Court’s decision to the European Court of Justice. The Company believes that any
incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due related to the State 
Aid Decision would be creditable against U. S. taxes, subject to any foreign tax
credit limitations in the Act.

On an annual basis, the Company may request approval from the Irish Minister for
Finance to reduce the recovery amount for certain taxes paid to other countries.
As of September 26, 2020, the adjusted recovery amount was €12.9 billion, 
excluding interest. The adjusted recovery amount plus interest is funded into 
escrow, where it will remain restricted from general use pending the conclusion 
of all legal proceedings. Refer to the Cash, Cash Equivalents and Marketable 
Securities section of Note 3, “Financial Instruments” for more information.
