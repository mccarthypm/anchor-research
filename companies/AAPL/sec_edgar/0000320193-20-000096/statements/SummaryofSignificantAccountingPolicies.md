Basis of Presentation and Preparation

The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of Apple Inc. and its
wholly owned subsidiaries (collectively “Apple” or the “Company”). Intercompany 
accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the opinion of the Company’s 
management, the consolidated financial statements reflect all adjustments, which
are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for fair financial statement 
presentation. The preparation of these consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes in conformity with U. S. generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the
amounts reported. Actual results could differ materially from those estimates. 
Certain prior period amounts in the consolidated financial statements and 
accompanying notes have been reclassified to conform to the current period’s 
presentation.

The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last 
Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2020, 2019 and 2018 spanned 52
weeks each. An additional week is included in the first fiscal quarter every 
five or six years to realign the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar 
quarters. Unless otherwise stated, references to particular years, quarters, 
months and periods refer to the Company’s fiscal years ended in September and 
the associated quarters, months and periods of those fiscal years.

Common Stock Split

On August 28, 2020, the Company effected a four-for-one stock split to 
shareholders of record as of August 24, 2020. All share, restricted stock unit 
(“RSU”) and per share or per RSU information has been retroactively adjusted to 
reflect the stock split.

Recently Adopted Accounting Pronouncements

Leases

At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted the Financial
Accounting Standards Board’s (the “FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ASU”) 
No. 2016-02, Leases (Topic 842)(“ASU 2016-02”), and additional ASUs issued to 
clarify and update the guidance in ASU 2016-02 (collectively, the “new leases 
standard”), which modifies lease accounting for lessees to increase transparency
and comparability by recording lease assets and liabilities for operating leases
and disclosing key information about leasing arrangements. The Company adopted 
the new leases standard utilizing the modified retrospective transition method, 
under which amounts in prior periods presented were not restated. For contracts 
existing at the time of adoption, the Company elected to not reassess (i) 
whether any are or contain leases, (ii) lease classification, and (iii) initial 
direct costs. Upon adoption, the Company recorded $7.5 billion of right-of-use 
(“ROU”) assets and $8.1 billion of lease liabilities on its Condensed 
Consolidated Balance Sheet.

Hedging

At the beginning of the first quarter of 2020, the Company adopted FASB ASU No. 
2017-12, Derivatives and Hedging (Topic 815): Targeted Improvements to 
Accounting for Hedging Activities(“ASU 2017-12”). ASU 2017-12 expands component 
and fair value hedging, specifies the presentation of the effects of hedging 
instruments, eliminates the separate measurement and presentation of hedge 
ineffectiveness, and updates disclosure requirements related to hedging. The 
Company adopted ASU 2017-12 utilizing the modified retrospective transition 
method. Upon adoption, the Company recorded a $136 million increase in 
accumulated other comprehensive income/(loss) (“AOCI”) and a corresponding 
decrease in retained earnings in the Condensed Consolidated Statement of 
Shareholders’ Equity.

Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.

Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense
on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately 
vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 9, “Benefit Plans.”

Earnings Per Share

The following table shows the computation of basic and diluted earnings per 
share for 2020, 2019 and 2018 (net income in millions and shares in thousands):

2.97      $               2.98  

The Company applies the treasury stock method to determine the dilutive effect 
of potentially dilutive securities. Potentially dilutive securities representing
62 million shares of common stock were excluded from the computation of diluted 
earnings per share for 2019 because their effect would have been antidilutive.

Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents.

The Company’s investments in marketable debt securities have been classified and
accounted for as available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt 
securities as either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s 
underlying contractual maturity date. Unrealized gains and losses on marketable 
debt securities classified as available-for-sale are recognized in other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“OCI”).

The Company’s investments in marketable equity securities are classified based 
on the nature of the securities and their availability for use in current 
operations. The Company’s marketable equity securities are measured at fair 
value with gains and losses recognized in other income/(expense), net (“OI& E”).

The cost of securities sold is determined using the specific identification 
method.

Inventories

Inventories are measured using the first-in, first-out method.

Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the 
lesser of 40 years or the remaining life of the building; between one three

Non-cash investing activities involving property, plant and equipment resulted 
in a net increase/(decrease) to accounts payable and other current liabilities 
of $(2.9) billion and $3.4 billion during 2019 and 2018, respectively.

Non-Marketable Securities

The Company has elected to apply the measurement alternative to equity 
securities without readily determinable fair values. As such, the Company’s 
non-marketable equity securities are measured at cost, less any impairment, and 
are adjusted for changes in fair value resulting from observable transactions 
for identical or similar investments of the same issuer. Gains and losses on 
non-marketable equity securities are recognized in OI& E.

Restricted Cash and Restricted Marketable Securities

The Company considers cash and marketable securities to be restricted when 
withdrawal or general use is legally restricted. The Company reports restricted 
cash as other assets in the Consolidated Balance Sheets, and determines current 
or non-current classification based on the expected duration of the restriction.
The Company reports restricted marketable securities as current or non-current 
marketable securities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets based on the 
classification of the underlying securities.

Fair Value Measurements

The fair values of the Company’s money market funds and certain marketable 
equity securities are based on quoted prices in active markets for identical 
assets. The valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s
debt instruments and all other financial instruments, which generally have 
counterparties with high credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or 
model-driven valuations using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by
observable market data.
