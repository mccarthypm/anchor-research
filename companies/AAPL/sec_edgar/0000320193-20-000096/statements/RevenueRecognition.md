Net sales consist of revenue from the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad, Services and 
other products. The Company recognizes revenue at the amount to which it expects
to be entitled when control of the products or services is transferred to its 
customers. Control is generally transferred when the Company has a present right
to payment and title and the significant risks and rewards of ownership of 
products or services are transferred to its customers. For most of the Company’s
Products net sales, control transfers when products are shipped. For the 
Company’s Services net sales, control transfers over time as services are 
delivered. Payment for Products and Services net sales is collected within a 
short period following transfer of control or commencement of delivery of 
services, as applicable.

The Company records reductions to Products net sales related to future product 
returns, price protection and other customer incentive programs based on the 
Company’s expectations and historical experience.

For arrangements with multiple performance obligations, which represent promises
within an arrangement that are distinct, the Company allocates revenue to all 
distinct performance obligations based on their relative stand-alone selling 
prices (“SSPs”). When available, the Company uses observable prices to determine
SSPs. When observable prices are not available, SSPs are established that 
reflect the Company’s best estimates of what the selling prices of the 
performance obligations would be if they were sold regularly on a stand-alone 
basis. The Company’s process for estimating SSPs without observable prices 
considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and 
circumstances related to each performance obligation including, where 
applicable, prices charged by the Company for similar offerings, market trends 
in the pricing for similar offerings, product-specific business objectives and 
the estimated cost to provide the performance obligation.

The Company has identified up to three performance obligations regularly 
included in arrangements involving the sale of iPhone, Mac, iPad and certain 
other products. The first performance obligation, which represents the 
substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware and bundled 
software delivered at the time of sale. The second performance obligation is the
right to receive certain product-related bundled services, which include iCloud,
Siri and Maps. The third performance obligation is the right to receive, on a 
when-and-if-available basis, future unspecified software upgrades relating to 
the software bundled with each device. The Company allocates revenue and any 
related discounts to these performance obligations based on their relative SSPs.
Because the Company lacks observable prices for the undelivered performance 
obligations, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s estimated SSPs.
Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and bundled software is recognized 
when control has transferred to the customer, which generally occurs when the 
product is shipped. Revenue allocated to the product-related bundled services 
and unspecified software upgrade rights is deferred and recognized on a 
straight-line basis over the estimated period they are expected to be provided. 
Cost of sales related to delivered hardware and bundled software, including 
estimated warranty costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to 
provide product-related bundled services and unspecified software upgrade rights
are recognized as cost of sales as incurred.

For certain long-term service arrangements, the Company has performance 
obligations for services it has not yet delivered. For these arrangements, the 
Company does not have a right to bill for the undelivered services. The Company 
has determined that any unbilled consideration relates entirely to the value of 
the undelivered services. Accordingly, the Company has not recognized revenue, 
and has elected not to disclose amounts, related to these undelivered services.

For the sale of third-party products where the Company obtains control of the 
product before transferring it to the customer, the Company recognizes revenue 
based on the gross amount billed to customers. The Company considers multiple 
factors when determining whether it obtains control of third-party products 
including, but not limited to, evaluating if it can establish the price of the 
product, retains inventory risk for tangible products or has the responsibility 
for ensuring acceptability of the product. For third-party applications sold 
through the App Store and certain digital content sold through the Company’s 
other digital content stores, the Company does not obtain control of the product
before transferring it to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such
sales on a net basis by recognizing in Services net sales only the commission it
retains.

The Company has elected to record revenue net of taxes collected from customers 
that are remitted to governmental authorities, with the collected taxes recorded
within other current liabilities until remitted to the relevant government 
authority.
