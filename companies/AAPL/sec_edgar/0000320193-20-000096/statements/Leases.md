The Company has lease arrangements for certain equipment and facilities, 
including retail, corporate, manufacturing and data center space. These leases 
typically have original terms not exceeding 10 years and generally contain 
multi-year renewal options, some of which are reasonably certain of exercise. 
The Company’s lease arrangements may contain both lease and non-lease 
components. The Company has elected to combine and account for lease and 
non-lease components as a single lease component for leases of retail, 
corporate, and data center facilities.

Payments under the Company’s lease arrangements may be fixed or variable, and 
variable lease payments are primarily based on purchases of output of the 
underlying leased assets. Lease costs associated with fixed payments on the 
Company’s operating leases were $1.5 billion for 2020. Lease costs associated 
with variable payments on the Company’s leases were $9.3 billion for 2020. Rent 
expense for operating leases, as previously reported under former lease 
accounting standards, was $1.3 billion and $1.2 billion in 2019 and 2018, 
respectively.

For 2020, the Company made $1.5 billion of fixed cash payments related to 
operating leases. Non-cash activities involving ROU assets obtained in exchange 
for lease liabilities were $10.5 billion for 2020, including the impact of 
adopting the new leases standard in the first quarter of 2020.

The following table shows ROU assets and lease liabilities, and the associated 
financial statement line items, as of September 26, 2020 (in millions):

The weighted-average remaining lease term and discount rate related to the 
Company’s lease liabilities as of September 26, 2020 were 10.3 years and 2.0%, 
respectively. The discount rates are generally based on estimates of the 
Company’s incremental borrowing rate, as the discount rates implicit in the 
Company’s leases cannot be readily determined.

As of September 26, 2020, the Company had $1.7 billion of future payments under 
additional leases, primarily for corporate facilities and retail space, that had
not yet commenced. These leases will commence between 2021 and 2022, with lease 
terms ranging from 1 year to 20 years.
