Item 3. Legal Proceedings

As of September 27, 2008, the end of the annual period covered by this report, the Company is subject to the various legal proceedings and claims discussed below, as well as certain other legal proceedings and
claims that have not been fully resolved and that have arisen in the ordinary course of business. In the opinion of management, the Company does not have a potential liability related to any current legal proceedings and claims that would
individually or in the aggregate have a material adverse effect on its financial condition or operating results. However, the results of legal proceedings cannot be predicted with certainty. Should the Company fail to prevail in any of these legal
matters or should several of these legal matters be resolved against the Company in the same reporting period, the operating results of a particular reporting period could be materially adversely affected. The Company settled certain matters during
the fourth quarter of 2008 that did not individually or in the aggregate have a material impact on the Company’s results of operations.

Bader v.
Anderson, et al.

Plaintiff filed this purported shareholder derivative action against the Company and each of its then current executive officers and
members of its Board of Directors on May 19, 2005 in Santa Clara County Superior Court asserting claims for breach of fiduciary duty, material misstatements and omissions and violations of California Business & Professions Code
§17200 (unfair competition). The complaint alleged that the Company’s March 14, 2005, proxy statement was false and misleading for failure to disclose certain information relating to the Apple Computer, Inc. Performance Bonus Plan,
which was approved by shareholders at the annual meeting held on April 21, 2005. Plaintiff, who ostensibly brought suit on the Company’s behalf, made no demand on the Board of Directors and alleged that such demand was excused. The
complaint sought injunctive and other relief for purported injury to the Company. On July 27, 2005, plaintiff filed an amended complaint alleging that, in addition to the purported derivative claims, adoption of the bonus plan and distribution
of the proxy statement describing that plan also inflicted injury on her directly as an individual shareholder. On January 10, 2006, the Court sustained defendants’ demurrer to the amended complaint, with leave to amend. Plaintiff filed a
second amended complaint on February 7, 2006, and the Company filed a demurrer. After a hearing on June 13, 2006, the Court sustained the demurrer without leave to amend as to the non-director officers and with leave to amend as to the
directors. On July 24, 2006, plaintiff filed a third amended complaint, which purported to bring claims derivatively as well as directly on behalf of a class of common stockholders who have been or will be harmed by virtue of the allegedly
misleading proxy statement. In addition to reasserting prior causes of action, the third amended complaint included a claim that the Company violated the terms of the plan, and a claim for waste related to restricted stock unit grants to certain
officers in 2003 and 2004 and an option grant to the Company’s CEO in January 2000. The Company filed a demurrer to the third amended complaint. On January 30, 2007, the Court sustained the Company’s demurrer with leave to amend. On
May 8, 2007, plaintiff filed a fourth amended complaint. The Company filed a demurrer to the fourth amended complaint, which the Court sustained, without leave to amend, on October 12, 2007. On October 25, 2007, the Court entered a
final judgment in favor of defendant and ordered the case dismissed with prejudice. On November 26, 2007, plaintiff filed a notice of appeal. Plaintiffs’ appeal is pending.

filed an amended complaint on December 29, 2005. Plaintiffs’ amended complaint added three plaintiffs and alleged many of the same factual claims as the previous complaints, such as alleged selling of used equipment as new, alleged failure
to honor warranties and service contracts for the consumer plaintiffs, and alleged fraud related to the opening of the Apple retail stores. Plaintiffs continued to assert causes of action for unfair competition (§17200), violations of the

designed using processes necessary to ensure normal resistance to scratching of the screen; and (2) all iPod nano purchasers other than U. S. residents who purchased an iPod nano that was not manufactured or designed using processes necessary to
ensure normal resistance to scratching of the screen. The Company answered the Master Complaint on November 20, 2006.
