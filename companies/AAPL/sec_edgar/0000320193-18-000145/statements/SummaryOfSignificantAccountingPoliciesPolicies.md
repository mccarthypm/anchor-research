The accompanying consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the 
Company. Intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated. In the 
opinion of the Company’s management, the consolidated financial statements 
reflect all adjustments, which are normal and recurring in nature, necessary for
fair financial statement presentation. The preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements and accompanying notes in conformity with U. S. generally 
accepted accounting principles (“ GAAP”) requires management to make estimates 
and assumptions that affect the amounts reported. Actual results could differ 
materially from those estimates. Certain prior period amounts in the 
consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been reclassified 
to conform to the current period’s presentation.

|   Fiscal Period | The Company’s fiscal year is the 52- or 53-week period that ends on the last 
Saturday of September. The Company’s fiscal years 2018 and 2016 spanned 52 weeks
each, whereas fiscal year 2017 included 53 weeks. A 14th week was included in 
the first fiscal quarter of 2017, as is done every five or six years, to realign
the Company’s fiscal quarters with calendar quarters. Unless otherwise stated, 
references to particular years, quarters, months and periods refer to the 
Company’s fiscal years ended in September and the associated quarters, months 
and periods of those fiscal years.

| **  Revenue Recognition** | Revenue Recognition

Net sales consist primarily of revenue from the sale of hardware, software, 
digital content and applications, accessories, and service and support 
contracts. The Company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an 
arrangement exists, delivery has occurred, the sales price is fixed or 
determinable and collection is probable. Product is considered delivered to the 
customer once it has been shipped and title, risk of loss and rewards of 
ownership have been transferred. For most of the Company’s product sales, these 
criteria are met at the time the product is shipped. For online sales to 
individuals, for some sales to education customers in the U. S., and for certain
other sales, the Company defers revenue until the customer receives the product 
because the Company retains a portion of the risk of loss on these sales during 
transit. For payment terms in excess of the Company’s standard payment terms, 
revenue is recognized as payments become due unless the Company has positive 
evidence that the sales price is fixed or determinable, such as a successful 
history of collection, without concession, on comparable arrangements. The 
Company recognizes revenue from the sale of hardware products, software bundled 
with hardware that is essential to the functionality of the hardware and 
third-party digital content sold on the iTunes Store in accordance with general 
revenue recognition accounting guidance. The Company recognizes revenue in 
accordance with industry-specific software accounting guidance for the following
types of sales transactions: (i) standalone sales of software products, (ii) 
sales of software upgrades and (iii) sales of software bundled with hardware not
essential to the functionality of the hardware.

For the sale of most third-party products, the Company recognizes revenue based 
on the gross amount billed to customers because the Company establishes its own 
pricing for such products, retains related inventory risk for physical products,
is the primary obligor to the customer and assumes the credit risk for amounts 
billed to its customers. For third-party applications sold through the App Store
and Mac App Store and certain digital content sold through the iTunes Store, the
Company does not determine the selling price of the products and is not the 
primary obligor to the customer. Therefore, the Company accounts for such sales 
on a net basis by recognizing in net sales only the commission it retains from 
each sale. The portion of the gross amount billed to customers that is remitted 
by the Company to third-party app developers and certain digital content owners 
is not reflected in the Company’s Consolidated Statements of Operations.

The Company records deferred revenue when it receives payments in advance of the
delivery of products or the performance of services. This includes amounts that 
have been deferred for unspecified and specified software upgrade rights and 
non-software services that are attached to hardware and software products. The 
Company sells gift cards redeemable at its retail and online stores, and also 
sells gift cards redeemable on iTunes Store, App Store, Mac App Store, TV App 
Store and Book Store for the purchase of digital content and software. The 
Company records deferred revenue upon the sale of the card, which is relieved 
upon redemption of the card by the customer. Revenue from AppleCare service and 
support contracts is deferred and recognized over the service coverage periods. 
AppleCare service and support contracts typically include extended phone 
support, repair services, web-based support resources and diagnostic tools 
offered under the Company’s standard limited warranty.

The Company records reductions to revenue for estimated commitments related to 
price protection and other customer incentive programs. For transactions 
involving price protection, the Company recognizes revenue net of the estimated 
amount to be refunded. For the Company’s other customer incentive programs, the 
estimated cost of these programs is recognized at the later of the date at which
the Company has sold the product or the date at which the program is offered. 
The Company also records reductions to revenue for expected future product 
returns based on the Company’s historical experience. Revenue is recorded net of
taxes collected from customers that are remitted to governmental authorities, 
with the collected taxes recorded as current liabilities until remitted to the 
relevant government authority.

Revenue Recognition for Arrangements with Multiple Deliverables

For multi-element arrangements that include hardware products containing 
software essential to the hardware product’s functionality, undelivered software
elements that relate to the hardware product’s essential software, and 
undelivered non-software services, the Company allocates revenue to all 
deliverables based on their relative selling prices. In such circumstances, the 
Company uses a hierarchy to determine the selling price to be used for 
allocating revenue to deliverables: (i) vendor-specific objective evidence of 
fair value (“ VSOE”), (ii) third-party evidence of selling price (“ TPE”) and 
(iii) best estimate of selling price (“ ESP”). VSOE generally exists only when 
the Company sells the deliverable separately and is the price actually charged 
by the Company for that deliverable. ESPs reflect the Company’s best estimates 
of what the selling prices of elements would be if they were sold regularly on a
stand-alone basis. For multi-element arrangements accounted for in accordance 
with industry-specific software accounting guidance, the Company allocates 
revenue to all deliverables based on the VSOE of each element, and if VSOE does 
not exist revenue is recognized when elements lacking VSOE are delivered.

For sales of iPhone, iPad, Mac and certain other products, the Company has 
indicated it may from time to time provide future unspecified software upgrades 
to the device’s essential software and/or non-software services free of charge. 
The Company has identified up tothreedeliverables regularly included in 
arrangements involving the sale of these devices. The first deliverable, which 
represents the substantial portion of the allocated sales price, is the hardware
and software essential to the functionality of the hardware device delivered at 
the time of sale. The second deliverable is the embedded right included with 
qualifying devices to receive, on a when-and-if-available basis, future 
unspecified software upgrades relating to the product’s essential software. The 
third deliverable is the non-software services to be provided to qualifying 
devices. The Company allocates revenue between these deliverables using the 
relative selling price method. Because the Company has neither VSOE nor TPE for 
these deliverables, the allocation of revenue is based on the Company’s ESPs. 
Revenue allocated to the delivered hardware and the related essential software 
is recognized at the time of sale, provided the other conditions for revenue 
recognition have been met. Revenue allocated to the embedded unspecified 
software upgrade rights and the non-software services is deferred and recognized
on a straight-line basis over the estimated period the software upgrades and 
non-software services are expected to be provided. Cost of sales related to 
delivered hardware and related essential software, including estimated warranty 
costs, are recognized at the time of sale. Costs incurred to provide 
non-software services are recognized as cost of sales as incurred, and 
engineering and sales and marketing costs are recognized as operating expenses 
as incurred.

The Company’s process for determining its ESP for deliverables without VSOE or 
TPE considers multiple factors that may vary depending upon the unique facts and
circumstances related to each deliverable including, where applicable, prices 
charged by the Company and market trends in the pricing for similar offerings, 
product-specific business objectives, estimated cost to provide the non-software
services and the relative ESP of the upgrade rights and non-software services as
compared to the total selling price of the product.

| **  Shipping Costs** | Shipping Costs

Amounts billed to customers related to shipping and handling are classified as 
revenue, and the Company’s shipping and handling costs are classified as cost of
sales.
 |
| **  Advertising Costs** | Advertising Costs

Advertising costs are expensed as incurred and included in selling, general and 
administrative expenses.
 |
| **  Share-Based Compensation** | Share-Based Compensation

The Company generally measures share-based compensation based on the closing 
price of the Company’s common stock on the date of grant, and recognizes expense
on a straight-line basis for its estimate of equity awards that will ultimately 
vest. Further information regarding share-based compensation can be found in 
Note 8, “ Benefit Plans.”
 |
| **  New Accounting Pronouncements** | During the first quarter of 2018, the Company adopted the Financial Accounting 
Standards Board’s (the “ FASB”) Accounting Standards Update (“ ASU”) No. 
2016-09, Compensation - Stock Compensation (Topic 718): Improvements to Employee
Share-Based Payment Accounting(“ ASU 2016-09”), which modified certain aspects 
of the accounting for share-based payment transactions, including income taxes, 
classification of awards and classification in the statement of cash flows. 
Historically, excess tax benefits or deficiencies from the Company’s equity 
awards were recorded as additional paid-in capital in its Consolidated Balance 
Sheets and were classified as a financing activity in its Consolidated 
Statements of Cash Flows. Beginning in 2018, the Company records any excess tax 
benefits or deficiencies from its equity awards as part of the provision for 
income taxes in its Consolidated Statements of Operations in the reporting 
periods in which equity vesting occurs. The Company elected to apply the cash 
flow classification requirements related to excess tax benefits retrospectively 
to all periods presented, which resulted in an increase to cash generated by 
operating activities in the Consolidated Statements of Cash Flows of$627 
millionand$407 millionfor2017and2016, respectively.

During the second quarter of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income 
Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of 
Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income(“ ASU 2018-02”).
ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of 
the Act on items within AOCI to retained earnings. The Company elected to apply 
the provision of ASU 2018-02 in 2018 with a reclassification of net tax benefits
related to cumulative foreign currency translation and unrealized gains/losses 
on derivative instruments and marketable securities, resulting in a$278 
milliondecrease in AOCI and a corresponding increase in retained earnings in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.
 |
| **  Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities** | Cash Equivalents and Marketable Securities

All highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less at the 
date of purchase are classified as cash equivalents. The Company’s marketable 
debt and equity securities have been classified and accounted for as 
available-for-sale. The Company classifies its marketable debt securities as 
either short-term or long-term based on each instrument’s underlying contractual
maturity date. Marketable equity securities, including mutual funds, are 
classified as short-term based on the nature of the securities and their 
availability for use in current operations. The cost of securities sold is 
determined using the specific identification method.
 |
| **  Inventories** | Inventories

Inventories are computed using the first-in, first-out method.
 |
| **  Property, Plant and Equipment** | Property, Plant and Equipment

Depreciation on property, plant and equipment is recognized on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets, which for buildings is the 
lesser of30 yearsor the remaining life of the underlying building; 
betweenoneandfive yearsfor machinery and equipment, including product tooling 
and manufacturing process equipment; and the shorter of lease term or useful 
life for leasehold improvements. Capitalized costs related to internal-use 
software are amortized on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives 
of the assets, which range fromthreetofive years.
 |
| **  Fair Value Measurements** | Fair Value Measurements

The Company’s valuation techniques used to measure the fair value of money 
market funds and certain marketable equity securities are derived from quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities. The valuation 
techniques used to measure the fair value of the Company’s debt instruments and 
all other financial instruments, which generally have counterparties with high 
credit ratings, are based on quoted market prices or model-driven valuations 
using significant inputs derived from or corroborated by observable market data.

Level 2 fair value estimates are based on observable inputs other than quoted 
prices in active markets for identical assets and liabilities, quoted prices for
identical or similar assets or liabilities in inactive markets, or other inputs 
that are observable or can be corroborated by observable market data for 
substantially the full term of the assets or liabilities.

Level 1 fair value estimates are based on quoted prices in active markets for 
identical assets or liabilities.
 |
| **  Derivative Financial Instruments** | Derivative Financial Instruments

The Company may use derivatives to partially offset its business exposure to 
foreign currency and interest rate risk on expected future cash flows, net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries, and certain existing assets and 
liabilities. However, the Company may choose not to hedge certain exposures for 
a variety of reasons including, but not limited to, accounting considerations or
the prohibitive economic cost of hedging particular exposures. There can be no 
assurance the hedges will offset more than a portion of the financial impact 
resulting from movements in foreign currency exchange or interest rates.

To protect gross margins from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, 
certain of the Company’s subsidiaries whose functional currency is the U. S. 
dollar may hedge a portion of forecasted foreign currency revenue, and 
subsidiaries whose functional currency is not the U. S. dollar may hedge a 
portion of forecasted inventory purchases not denominated in the subsidiaries’ 
functional currencies. The Company may enter into forward contracts, option 
contracts or other instruments to manage this risk and may designate these 
instruments as cash flow hedges. The Company generally hedges portions of its 
forecasted foreign currency exposure associated with revenue and inventory 
purchases, typically for up to12 months.

To protect the net investment in a foreign operation from fluctuations in 
foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may enter into foreign currency 
forward and option contracts to offset a portion of the changes in the carrying 
amounts of these investments due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates. In addition, the Company may use non-derivative financial instruments, 
such as its foreign currency - denominated debt, as hedges of its net 
investments in certain foreign subsidiaries. In both of these cases, the Company
designates these instruments as net investment hedges.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates, the Company may
enter into forward contracts, cross-currency swaps or other instruments. These 
instruments may offset a portion of the foreign currency remeasurement gains or 
losses, or changes in fair value. The Company may designate these instruments as
either cash flow or fair value hedges. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, the Company’s 
hedged term debt - and marketable securities - related foreign currency 
transactions are expected to be recognized within24 years.

The Company may also enter into non-designated foreign currency contracts to 
offset a portion of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses generated by 
the remeasurement of certain assets and liabilities denominated in 
non-functional currencies.

To protect the Company’s foreign currency - denominated term debt or marketable 
securities from fluctuations in interest rates, the Company may enter into 
interest rate swaps, options or other instruments. These instruments may offset 
a portion of the changes in interest income or expense, or changes in fair 
value. The Company designates these instruments as either cash flow or fair 
value hedges. As ofSeptember 29, 2018, the Company’s hedged interest rate 
transactions are expected to be recognized within9 years.

Cash Flow Hedges

The effective portions of cash flow hedges are recorded in accumulated other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“ AOCI”) until the hedged item is recognized in 
earnings. Deferred gains and losses associated with cash flow hedges of foreign 
currency revenue are recognized as a component of net sales in the same period 
as the related revenue is recognized, and deferred gains and losses related to 
cash flow hedges of inventory purchases are recognized as a component of cost of
sales in the same period as the related costs are recognized. Deferred gains and
losses associated with cash flow hedges of interest income or expense are 
recognized in other income/(expense), net in the same period as the related 
income or expense is recognized. For options designated as cash flow hedges, 
changes in the time value are excluded from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the 
effectiveness testing of cash flow hedges are recognized in other 
income/(expense), net.

Derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges must be de-designated as 
hedges when it is probable the forecasted hedged transaction will not occur in 
the initially identified time period or within a subsequent two-month time 
period. Deferred gains and losses in AOCI associated with such derivative 
instruments are reclassified into other income/(expense), net in the period of 
de-designation. Any subsequent changes in fair value of such derivative 
instruments are reflected in other income/(expense), net unless they are 
re-designated as hedges of other transactions.

Net Investment Hedges

The effective portions of net investment hedges are recorded in other 
comprehensive income/(loss) (“ OCI”) as a part of the cumulative translation 
adjustment. The ineffective portions and amounts excluded from the effectiveness
testing of net investment hedges are recognized in other income/(expense), net. 
For forward exchange contracts designated as net investment hedges, the Company 
excludes changes in fair value relating to changes in the forward carry 
component from its definition of effectiveness. Accordingly, any gains or losses
related to this forward carry component are recognized in earnings in the 
current period.

Fair Value Hedges

Gains and losses related to changes in fair value hedges are recognized in 
earnings along with a corresponding loss or gain related to the change in value 
of the underlying hedged item in the same line in the Consolidated Statements of
Operations.

Non-Designated Derivatives

Derivatives that are not designated as hedging instruments are adjusted to fair 
value through earnings in the financial statement line item to which the 
derivative relates.

The Company records all derivatives in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair 
value. The Company’s accounting treatment for these derivative instruments is 
based on its hedge designation.

| **  Segment Reporting** | Segment Information and Geographic Data

The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The 
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for 
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s 
reportable segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and 
Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. 
Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific 
includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other
reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware 
and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to 
better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution 
partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The 
accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in 
Note 1, “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net 
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally 
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores
located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment 
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating 
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are 
generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are 
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense 
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded 
from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as 
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based 
compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other 
separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not 
include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting 
purposes.
