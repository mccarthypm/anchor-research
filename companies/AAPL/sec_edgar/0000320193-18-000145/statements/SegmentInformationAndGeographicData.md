The Company reports segment information based on the “management” approach. The 
management approach designates the internal reporting used by management for 
making decisions and assessing performance as the source of the Company’s 
reportable segments.

The Company manages its business primarily on a geographic basis. The Company’s 
reportable segments consist of the Americas, Europe, Greater China, Japan and 
Rest of Asia Pacific. Americas includes both North and South America. Europe 
includes European countries, as well as India, the Middle East and Africa. 
Greater China includes China, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Rest of Asia Pacific 
includes Australia and those Asian countries not included in the Company’s other
reportable segments. Although the reportable segments provide similar hardware 
and software products and similar services, each one is managed separately to 
better align with the location of the Company’s customers and distribution 
partners and the unique market dynamics of each geographic region. The 
accounting policies of the various segments are the same as those described in 
Note 1, “ Summary of Significant Accounting Policies.”

The Company evaluates the performance of its reportable segments based on net 
sales and operating income. Net sales for geographic segments are generally 
based on the location of customers and sales through the Company’s retail stores
located in those geographic locations. Operating income for each segment 
includes net sales to third parties, related cost of sales and operating 
expenses directly attributable to the segment. Advertising expenses are 
generally included in the geographic segment in which the expenditures are 
incurred. Operating income for each segment excludes other income and expense 
and certain expenses managed outside the reportable segments. Costs excluded 
from segment operating income include various corporate expenses such as 
research and development, corporate marketing expenses, certain share-based 
compensation expenses, income taxes, various nonrecurring charges and other 
separately managed general and administrative costs. The Company does not 
include intercompany transfers between segments for management reporting 
purposes.
