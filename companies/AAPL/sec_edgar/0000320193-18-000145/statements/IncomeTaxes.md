U. S. Tax Cuts and Jobs Act

On December 22, 2017, the U. S. enacted the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act (the “ Act”), 
which significantly changed U. S. tax law. The Act lowered the Company’s U. S. 
statutory federal income tax rate from35%to21%effective January 1, 2018, while 
also imposing a deemed repatriation tax on previously deferred foreign income. 
The Act also created a new minimum tax on certain future foreign earnings. The 
impact of the Act increased the Company’s provision for income taxes by$1.5 
billionduring 2018. This increase was composed of$2.0 billionrelated to the 
remeasurement of net deferred tax assets and liabilities and$1.2 
billionassociated with the deemed repatriation tax, partially offset by a$1.7 
billionimpact the deemed repatriation tax had on the Company’s unrecognized tax 
benefits.

Deferred Tax Balances

As a result of the Act, the Company remeasured certain deferred tax assets and 
liabilities based on the revised rates at which they are expected to reverse, 
including items for which the related income tax effects were originally 
recognized in OCI. In addition, the Company elected to record certain deferred 
tax assets and liabilities related to the new minimum tax on certain future 
foreign earnings. Of the$2.0 billionrecognized related to the remeasurement of 
net deferred tax assets and liabilities,$1.2 billionis a provisional estimate 
that incorporates assumptions based upon the most recent interpretations of the 
Act and may change as the Company continues to analyze the impact of additional 
implementation guidance. The Company’s provisional estimates are in accordance 
with the U. S. Securities and Exchange Commission Staff Accounting Bulletin No. 
118.

Deemed Repatriation Tax

As of September 30, 2017, the Company had a U. S. deferred tax liability of$36.4
billionfor deferred foreign income. During 2018, the Company replaced$36.1 
billionof its U. S. deferred tax liability with a deemed repatriation tax 
payable of$37.3 billion, which was based on the Company’s cumulative post-1986 
deferred foreign income. The deemed repatriation tax payable is a provisional 
estimate that may change as the Company continues to analyze the impact of 
additional implementation guidance. The Company plans to pay the tax in 
installments in accordance with the Act.

Adoption of ASU No. 2018-02

During the second quarter of 2018, the FASB issued ASU No. 2018-02, Income 
Statement - Reporting Comprehensive Income (Topic 220): Reclassification of 
Certain Tax Effects from Accumulated Other Comprehensive Income(“ ASU 2018-02”).
ASU 2018-02 allows an entity to elect to reclassify the income tax effects of 
the Act on items within AOCI to retained earnings. The Company elected to apply 
the provision of ASU 2018-02 in 2018 with a reclassification of net tax benefits
related to cumulative foreign currency translation and unrealized gains/losses 
on derivative instruments and marketable securities, resulting in a$278 
milliondecrease in AOCI and a corresponding increase in retained earnings in the
Consolidated Balance Sheet and Consolidated Statement of Shareholders’ Equity.

The Company’s income taxes payable have been reduced by the tax benefits from 
employee stock plan awards. For restricted stock units (“ RSUs”), the Company 
receives an income tax benefit upon the award’s vesting equal to the tax effect 
of the underlying stock’s fair market value. Prior to adopting ASU 2016-09 in 
the first quarter of 2018, the Company reflected net excess tax benefits from 
equity awards as increases to additional paid-in capital, which amounted to$620 
millionand$379 millionin2017and2016, respectively. Refer to Note 1, “ Summary of
Significant Accounting Policies” for more information.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities reflect the effects of tax losses, credits 
and the future income tax effects of temporary differences between the 
consolidated financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and 
liabilities and their respective tax bases and are measured using enacted tax 
rates that apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary 
differences are expected to be recovered or settled.

Uncertain Tax Positions

As ofSeptember 29, 2018, the total amount of gross unrecognized tax benefits 
was$9.7 billion, of which$7.4 billion, if recognized, would impact the Company’s
effective tax rate. As ofSeptember 30, 2017, the total amount of gross 
unrecognized tax benefits was$8.4 billion, of which$2.5 billion, if recognized, 
would have impacted the Company’s effective tax rate.

The aggregate changes in the balance of gross unrecognized tax benefits, which 
excludes interest and penalties, for2018,2017and2016, is as follows (in 
millions):

9,694      $         8,407      $          7,724  

The Company includes interest and penalties related to unrecognized tax benefits
within the provision for income taxes. As ofSeptember 29, 2018andSeptember 30, 
2017, the total amount of gross interest and penalties accrued was$1.4 
billionand$1.2 billion, respectively. Both the unrecognized tax benefits and the
associated interest and penalties that are not expected to result in payment or 
receipt of cash within one year are classified as other non-current liabilities 
in the Consolidated Balance Sheets. In connection with tax matters, the Company 
recognized interest and penalty expense in2018,2017and2016of$236 million,$165 
millionand$295 million, respectively.

The Company is subject to taxation and files income tax returns in the U. S. 
federal jurisdiction and in many state and foreign jurisdictions. The U. S. 
Internal Revenue Service (the “ IRS”) concluded its review of the years 2013 
through 2015 in 2018, and all years prior to 2016 are closed. Tax years 
subsequent to 2006 in certain major U. S. states and subsequent to 2007 in 
certain major foreign jurisdictions remain open, and could be subject to 
examination by the taxing authorities. The Company believes that an adequate 
provision has been made for any adjustments that may result from tax 
examinations. However, the outcome of tax audits cannot be predicted with 
certainty. If any issues addressed in the Company’s tax audits are resolved in a
manner inconsistent with its expectations, the Company could be required to 
adjust its provision for income taxes in the period such resolution occurs. 
Although timing of resolution and/or closure of audits is not certain, the 
Company believes it is reasonably possible that its gross unrecognized tax 
benefits could decrease (either by payment, release or a combination of both) in
the next 12 months by as much as$800 million.

European Commission State Aid Decision

On August 30, 2016, the European Commission announced its decision that Ireland 
granted state aid to the Company by providing tax opinions in 1991 and 2007 
concerning the tax allocation of profits of the Irish branches oftwosubsidiaries
of the Company (the “ State Aid Decision”). The State Aid Decision ordered 
Ireland to calculate and recover additional taxes from the Company for the 
period June 2003 through December 2014. The recovery amount was calculated to 
be€13.1 billion, plus interest of€1.2 billion. Irish legislative changes, 
effective as of January 2015, eliminated the application of the tax opinions 
from that date forward. The Company believes the State Aid Decision to be 
without merit and appealed to the General Court of the Court of Justice of the 
European Union. Ireland has also appealed the State Aid Decision. The Company 
believes that any incremental Irish corporate income taxes potentially due 
related to the State Aid Decision would be creditable against U. S. taxes, 
subject to any foreign tax credit limitations in the Act. As ofSeptember 29, 
2018, the entire recovery amount plus interest was funded into escrow, where it 
will remain restricted from general use pending conclusion of all appeals. Refer
to Note 2, “ Financial Instruments” for more information.
