Agreements entered into by the Company may include indemnification provisions 
which may subject the Company to costs and damages in the event of a claim 
against an indemnified third party. Except as disclosed under the heading “ 
Contingencies” below, in the opinion of management, there was not at least a 
reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a 
material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to indemnification 
of third parties.

The Company offers an iPhone Upgrade Program, which is available to customers 
who purchase a qualifying iPhone in the U. S., the U. K. and mainland China. The
iPhone Upgrade Program provides customers the right to trade in that iPhone for 
a specified amount when purchasing a new iPhone, provided certain conditions are
met. The Company accounts for the trade-in right as a guarantee liability and 
recognizes arrangement revenue net of the fair value of such right, with 
subsequent changes to the guarantee liability recognized within revenue.

The Company has entered into indemnification agreements with its directors and 
executive officers. Under these agreements, the Company has agreed to indemnify 
such individuals to the fullest extent permitted by law against liabilities that
arise by reason of their status as directors or officers of the Company, and to 
advance expenses incurred by such individuals in connection with related legal 
proceedings. It is not possible to determine the maximum potential amount of 
payments the Company could be required to make under these agreements due to the
limited history of prior indemnification claims and the unique facts and 
circumstances involved in each claim. While the Company maintains directors and 
officers liability insurance coverage, such insurance coverage may be 
insufficient to cover all losses or all types of claims that may arise.

Concentrations in the Available Sources of Supply of Materials and Product

Although most components essential to the Company’s business are generally 
available from multiple sources, certain components are currently obtained from 
single or limited sources. In addition, the Company competes for various 
components with other participants in the markets for mobile communication and 
media devices and personal computers. Therefore, many components used by the 
Company, including those that are available from multiple sources, are at times 
subject to industry-wide shortage and significant commodity pricing fluctuations
that could materially adversely affect the Company’s financial condition and 
operating results.

The Company uses some custom components that are not commonly used by its 
competitors, and new products introduced by the Company often utilize custom 
components available from only one source. When a component or product uses new 
technologies, initial capacity constraints may exist until the suppliers’ yields
have matured or manufacturing capacity has increased. If the Company’s supply of
components for a new or existing product were delayed or constrained, or if an 
outsourcing partner delayed shipments of completed products to the Company, the 
Company’s financial condition and operating results could be materially 
adversely affected. The Company’s business and financial performance could also 
be materially adversely affected depending on the time required to obtain 
sufficient quantities from the original source, or to identify and obtain 
sufficient quantities from an alternative source. Continued availability of 
these components at acceptable prices, or at all, may be affected if suppliers 
decide to concentrate on the production of common components instead of 
components customized to meet the Company’s requirements.

The Company has entered into agreements for the supply of many components; 
however, there can be no guarantee that the Company will be able to extend or 
renew these agreements on similar terms, or at all. Therefore, the Company 
remains subject to significant risks of supply shortages and price increases 
that could materially adversely affect its financial condition and operating 
results.

Substantially all of the Company’s hardware products are manufactured by 
outsourcing partners that are located primarily in Asia, with some Mac computers
manufactured in the U. S. and Ireland. A significant concentration of this 
manufacturing is currently performed by a small number of outsourcing partners, 
often in single locations. Certain of these outsourcing partners are 
single-sourced suppliers of components and manufacturers for many of the 
Company’s products. Although the Company works closely with its outsourcing 
partners on manufacturing schedules, the Company’s financial condition and 
operating results could be materially adversely affected if its outsourcing 
partners were unable to meet their production commitments. The Company’s 
manufacturing purchase obligations typically cover its requirements for periods 
up to150 days.

Other Off - Balance Sheet Commitments

Operating Leases

The Company leases various equipment and facilities, including retail space, 
under noncancelable operating lease arrangements. The Company does not currently
utilize any other off - balance sheet financing arrangements. As ofSeptember 29,
2018, the Company’s total future minimum lease payments under noncancelable 
operating leases were$9.6 billion. The Company’s retail store and other facility
leases typically have original terms not exceeding10 yearsand generally contain 
multi-year renewal options.

Rent expense under all operating leases, including both cancelable and 
noncancelable leases, was$1.2 billion,$1.1 billionand$939 
millionin2018,2017and2016, respectively. Future minimum lease payments under 
noncancelable operating leases having initial or remaining terms in excess of 
one year as ofSeptember 29, 2018, are as follows (in millions):

        2019      $        1,298  
        2020               1,289  
        2021               1,218  
        2022               1,038  
        2023      800             
  Thereafter               3,984  
       Total      $        9,627  

Unconditional Purchase Obligations

The Company has entered into certain off - balance sheet arrangements which 
require the future purchase of goods or services (“unconditional purchase 
obligations”). The Company’s unconditional purchase obligations primarily 
consist of payments for supplier arrangements, internet and telecommunication 
services and intellectual property licenses. Future payments under noncancelable
unconditional purchase obligations having a remaining term in excess of one year
as ofSeptember 29, 2018, are as follows (in millions):

        2019      $        2,447  
        2020               3,202  
        2021               1,749  
        2022               1,596  
        2023      268             
  Thereafter      66              
       Total      $        9,328  

Contingencies

The Company is subject to various legal proceedings and claims that have arisen 
in the ordinary course of business and that have not been fully adjudicated, as 
further discussed in Part I, Item 1A of this Form 10-K under the heading “ Risk 
Factors” and in Part I, Item 3 of this Form 10-K under the heading “ Legal 
Proceedings.” The outcome of litigation is inherently uncertain. If one or more 
legal matters were resolved against the Company in a reporting period for 
amounts in excess of management’s expectations, the Company’s financial 
condition and operating results for that reporting period could be materially 
adversely affected. In the opinion of management, there was not at least a 
reasonable possibility the Company may have incurred a material loss, or a 
material loss in excess of a recorded accrual, with respect to loss 
contingencies for asserted legal and other claims, except for the following 
matters:

VirnetX

VirnetX, Inc. filed two lawsuits in the U. S. District Court for the Eastern 
District of Texas (the “ Eastern Texas District Court”) against the Company 
alleging that certain Company products infringe four patents (the “ VirnetX 
Patents”) relating to network communications technology (“ VirnetX I” and “ 
VirnetX II”). On September 30, 2016, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX I 
against the Company and awarded damages of$302 million, which later increased 
to$440 millionin post-trial proceedings. VirnetX I is currently on appeal at the
U. S. Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit (the “ Federal Circuit”). On 
April 11, 2018, a jury returned a verdict in VirnetX II against the Company and 
awarded damages of$503 million. VirnetX II is currently on appeal. The Company 
has challenged the validity of the VirnetX Patents at the U. S. Patent and 
Trademark Office (the “ PTO”). In response, the PTO has declared the VirnetX 
Patents invalid. VirnetX has appealed, and those appeals are currently pending 
at the Federal Circuit. The Federal Circuit has consolidated the Company’s 
appeal of the Eastern Texas District Court VirnetX I verdict and VirnetX’s 
appeals from the PTO invalidity proceedings. The Company believes it will 
prevail on the merits.

Qualcomm

On January 20, 2017, the Company filed a lawsuit against Qualcomm Incorporated 
and affiliated parties (“ Qualcomm”) in the U. S. District Court for the 
Southern District of California seeking, among other things, to enjoin Qualcomm 
from requiring the Company to pay royalties at the rate demanded by Qualcomm. As
the Company does not believe the demanded royalty it has historically paid 
contract manufacturers for each applicable device is fair, reasonable and 
non-discriminatory, and believes it to be invalid and/or overstated in other 
respects as well, no Qualcomm-related royalty payments have been remitted by the
Company to its contract manufacturers since the beginning of the second quarter 
of 2017. The Company believes it will prevail on the merits of the case and has 
accrued its best estimate for the ultimate resolution of this matter.
